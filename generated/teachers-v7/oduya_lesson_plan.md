# Year 5 Science Lesson Plan — Separating Mixtures Investigation

**Teacher**: Ms. Oduya (Y5 class teacher / Science subject lead)
**Cluster**: `SC-KS2-D011-CL002` — *Investigate dissolving and how to separate mixtures*
**Content Vehicle**: `SC-KS2-CV010` — *Separating Mixtures* (investigation, fair test)
**Thinking Lens**: Cause and Effect (primary) / Patterns (secondary)
**Date**: Spring Term, Year 5
**Duration**: 60 minutes

---

## 1. Learning Objectives ✅

### Science Content Objectives (from graph)
- Understand that some materials dissolve in liquid to form a solution and the dissolved substance can be recovered by evaporating the solvent (`SC-KS2-C048`)
- Know that mixtures can be separated using filtering, sieving, and evaporating, and that the appropriate technique depends on the properties of the components (`SC-KS2-C049`)

### Working Scientifically Objectives (from graph — programme level)
- Plan enquiries by identifying and controlling variables (fair test) — linked to `SC-KS2-C048` via `DEVELOPS_SKILL` with `enquiry_type: fair_test`
- Make systematic observations and take accurate measurements using standard units
- Record data in varied formats (tables, labelled diagrams)
- Draw conclusions from results and evaluate evidence

### Thinking Lens Focus (from graph)
- **Cause and Effect**: "What caused this to happen, and how do we know?" — pupils design fair tests to establish causal claims about which separation method works for which mixture type

**Rating**: ✅ *Graph provided both content objectives and WS skills. The concept-level DEVELOPS_SKILL link explicitly tags this as a fair_test enquiry, which is exactly right.*

---

## 2. Success Criteria ✅

From graph (`SC-KS2-CV010.success_criteria`):

- [ ] Choose and explain the correct separation method for different mixtures
- [ ] Explain what happens when a substance dissolves
- [ ] Recover a dissolved substance by evaporation
- [ ] Classify changes as reversible or irreversible with examples

**Teacher additions** (invented — not in graph):
- [ ] Record the investigation using a method diagram and results table
- [ ] Use the terms solute, solvent, and solution correctly in written explanations
- [ ] Identify and control variables in a fair test

**Rating**: ✅ *Content vehicle provided 4 clear success criteria. I added 3 WS-focused criteria that the graph implies but doesn't state explicitly as success criteria.*

---

## 3. Prior Knowledge Required ✅

### From graph (PREREQUISITE_OF relationships):
- **Three States of Matter** (`SC-KS2-C034`, from Y4 States of Matter domain) — pupils must understand that materials can be classified as solids, liquids or gases based on observable properties
- **Extended Material Properties** (`SC-KS2-D011-CL001`) — the sequenced-before cluster; pupils should have compared and grouped materials by hardness, solubility, thermal conductivity, response to magnets, and transparency

### From graph (cluster context):
- Prior understanding that dissolving requires a solvent (liquid), melting requires heat — distinction to be explicitly addressed

### Baseline check (invented — not in graph):
- Quick starter: "Sort these words into Solid, Liquid, Gas: ice, steam, water, oxygen, sand, juice" — to confirm Y4 prerequisite is secure

**Rating**: ✅ *Graph provided explicit prerequisite chain (Three States of Matter) and domain sequencing. The cluster pedagogical rationale explicitly flags the dissolving/melting distinction. I invented the baseline check activity.*

## 4. Lesson Structure with Timings ⚠️

### Introduction — 10 minutes

| Time | Activity | Source |
|------|----------|--------|
| 0-3 min | **Challenge problem** (from learner profile — "start with a challenge problem, do not explain first"): Present pupils with a sealed bag containing a mixture of salt, sand, and iron filings. Ask: "How could you get each material out of this mixture on its own?" Give 2 minutes thinking time. | Invented activity; pedagogy sequence from graph |
| 3-7 min | **I Notice / I Wonder** (from interaction type `pattern_discovery`): Pupils share observations. Teacher records on board without correcting. "That's interesting — what else do you notice?" | Interaction type from graph; teacher script invented |
| 7-10 min | **Key vocabulary introduction**: Display and define — dissolve, solution, solute, solvent, soluble, insoluble, filter, sieve, evaporate, separate, mixture, residue, filtrate. Pupils read aloud and discuss. | Vocabulary from graph (both concepts + vehicle definitions list) |

### Main Activity — 35 minutes

| Time | Activity | Source |
|------|----------|--------|
| 10-15 min | **Guided exploration — demonstration of separation techniques**: Teacher demonstrates sieving (separate rice from flour), filtering (separate sand from water), and evaporation (show pre-prepared evaporating dish with salt crystals from yesterday's solution). Link each technique to the property it exploits: particle size (sieving), solubility (filtering vs evaporating). | Teaching guidance from `SC-KS2-C049`; equipment list from `SC-KS2-CV010` |
| 15-18 min | **Fair test planning**: Pupils plan their investigation of the mystery mixture (salt + sand + iron filings). They must identify: independent variable (separation method), dependent variable (success of separation), controlled variables (same amount of mixture). Record in planning frame. | Variables from `SC-KS2-CV010` (independent, dependent, controlled); WS skill: planning enquiries |
| 18-40 min | **Practical investigation — Mystery Mixture Challenge**: Groups follow their plans: (1) Use magnet to remove iron filings, (2) Add water and stir to dissolve salt, (3) Filter to remove sand, (4) Evaporate to recover salt. Record each step with a method diagram. Record observations in results table. | Teaching guidance from `SC-KS2-C049`; recording format from `SC-KS2-CV010`: "method diagram for each separation -> results table -> reversible vs irreversible sorting activity" |
| 40-45 min | **Weighing evidence** (from `SC-KS2-C048` teaching guidance): Weigh water before and after dissolving salt. "The mass has increased — the salt is still there even though invisible." Address misconception: "Children often think that when something dissolves it has gone forever." | Teaching guidance and common misconceptions from graph |

### Plenary — 15 minutes

| Time | Activity | Source |
|------|----------|--------|
| 45-50 min | **Cause and Effect reflection** (thinking lens from graph): Each group shares their separation sequence using "If... then... because..." structure. "If you filter salt water, then the salt passes through because it is dissolved — you need evaporation instead." | Thinking lens question stems from graph; cause-and-effect agent prompt |
| 50-55 min | **Drag to Categorise** (from interaction type `drag_categorise`): Sort changes into Reversible / Irreversible. Include: dissolving salt, filtering sand, evaporating water, burning wood, cooking an egg, melting ice. | Interaction type from graph; examples invented from domain context |
| 55-60 min | **Assessment — Multiple Choice** (from interaction type `multi_choice_4`): 4 questions with misconception-based distractors. E.g., "Jasmine dissolved sugar in water. She says the sugar has disappeared forever. What should she do to prove the sugar is still there?" A) Filter it B) Sieve it C) Evaporate the water D) Add more sugar. | Interaction type from graph; questions invented using common misconceptions from graph |

**Rating**: ⚠️ *Graph provided the pedagogy sequence (challenge problem -> guided exploration -> worked example -> independent practice -> retrieval practice), interaction types, thinking lens question stems, recording format, and variables. However, I had to invent all specific activities, timings, and the lesson flow structure. The graph gives ingredients but not the recipe.*

## 5. Key Vocabulary with Definitions ✅

From graph (`SC-KS2-C048` key_vocabulary + `SC-KS2-C049` key_vocabulary + `SC-KS2-CV010` definitions):

| Term | Definition | Source |
|------|-----------|--------|
| dissolve | When a solid mixes completely into a liquid so you can no longer see it | Graph (C048) |
| solution | A mixture made when a solute dissolves in a solvent | Graph (CV010 definitions) |
| solute | The substance that dissolves (e.g., salt) | Graph (C048) |
| solvent | The liquid that does the dissolving (e.g., water) | Graph (C048) |
| soluble | A material that dissolves in a liquid | Graph (CV010 definitions) |
| insoluble | A material that does NOT dissolve in a liquid | Graph (CV010 definitions) |
| filter | Using paper or mesh to separate an insoluble solid from a liquid | Graph (CV010 definitions) |
| sieve | Using a mesh to separate solids of different sizes | Graph (CV010 definitions) |
| evaporate | When a liquid changes to a gas, leaving a dissolved solid behind | Graph (CV010 definitions) |
| mixture | Two or more substances mixed together but not chemically joined | Graph (C049) |
| residue | The solid left behind in the filter paper | Graph (C049) |
| filtrate | The liquid that passes through the filter paper | Graph (C049) |
| reversible | A change that can be undone to get back the original materials | Graph (CV010 definitions) |
| irreversible | A change that cannot be undone — a new substance is formed | Graph (CV010 definitions) |
| particle | A tiny piece of a substance, too small to see | Graph (C048) |
| technique/method | A specific way of doing something in science | Graph (C049) |

**Rating**: ✅ *Graph provided rich vocabulary across both concepts and the content vehicle definitions list. All 16 terms sourced from graph. Definitions are my own child-friendly versions — the graph provides term lists but not pupil-facing definitions.*

## 6. Resources and Materials Needed ⚠️

### From graph (`SC-KS2-CV010.equipment`):
- Salt
- Sand
- Water
- Iron filings
- Filter paper
- Funnels
- Sieves (various mesh sizes)
- Evaporating dishes
- Magnets
- Safety goggles

### Invented (not in graph — essential for this lesson):
- Beakers / containers (250ml)
- Stirring rods
- Teaspoons / spatulas for measuring
- Electronic scales / balance (for weighing demonstration)
- Water bath or hot plate (for evaporation — teacher use only)
- Timer / stopwatch
- Recording sheets (method diagram template + results table)
- Whiteboard and markers for class recording
- Paper towels / newspaper for spills
- Washing-up bowls for used equipment

**Rating**: ⚠️ *The content vehicle provides a good starting equipment list (10 items), but it's missing standard lab consumables that any teacher would need (beakers, stirring rods, scales, heat source). For a practical science lesson, the equipment list needs to be complete enough to actually set up the activity. About 40% of what I'd need was missing.*

---

## 7. Differentiation (Support + Extension) ⚠️

### Support (scaffolded — from learner profile)
- **Scaffolding level**: moderate_to_high (from graph pedagogy profile)
- **Hint tiers**: max 3 (from graph)
- Pre-prepared method diagram with labelled steps (pupils fill in observations only)
- Vocabulary word bank with pictures on table
- Adult support during filtering step (fine motor demand)
- Sentence starters for conclusions: "I separated the _____ by _____ because _____"

### Core
- Follow the investigation as planned above
- Complete method diagram, results table, and sorting activity independently
- Write a conclusion using scientific vocabulary

### Extension
- Investigate a more complex mixture (e.g., salt + sand + paper clips + rice) — requires sequencing multiple techniques
- Predict what would happen if you tried to filter salt water — test and explain why it doesn't work
- Research real-world applications: water purification plant, recycling centre sorting

### Greater Depth
- Design an investigation to find out whether water temperature affects dissolving rate
- Calculate and compare the mass of salt recovered vs. mass originally dissolved — account for any loss

**Rating**: ⚠️ *The graph provided scaffolding level and hint tiers from the learner profile, and the vehicle's expected_outcome gives the core target. But specific differentiation activities (support frames, extension tasks, greater depth challenges) were entirely invented. No DifficultyLevel nodes exist for Y5 Science — the pilot covers Y3 Maths only. This is the biggest structural gap for differentiation.*

## 8. Assessment Opportunities ⚠️

### From graph (`SC-KS2-CV010.assessment_guidance`):
> "Can pupils choose an appropriate separation method for a given mixture and explain why? Can they explain the difference between dissolving and melting? Can they classify changes as reversible or irreversible with examples?"

### Assessment plan (combining graph + invented):

| When | What | How | Source |
|------|------|-----|--------|
| Starter | Prior knowledge check — states of matter | Observation of sorting activity | Invented |
| Planning | Can pupils identify variables? | Check planning frames | WS skill from graph; activity invented |
| During practical | Can pupils select the right technique for each component? | Circulate and question | Assessment guidance from graph |
| Weighing demo | Do pupils understand the dissolved substance is still present? | Listen for misconception language | Misconception from graph (C048) |
| Plenary sort | Can pupils classify changes as reversible/irreversible? | Observe categorisation accuracy | Assessment guidance from graph |
| MC questions | Can pupils apply understanding to new scenarios? | Check answers and reasoning | Misconception-based distractors from graph |
| Written conclusion | Can pupils use scientific vocabulary accurately? | Mark written work | Vocabulary from graph |

### Feedback approach (from graph — feedback profile):
- **Style**: specific competence — name the skill demonstrated
- **On errors**: explain the specific misconception, not just "wrong" — e.g., "You chose filtering for the salt — filtering catches bits that haven't dissolved, but salt has dissolved so it passes straight through. Evaporation is the way to get dissolved substances back."
- **Avoid**: "Wrong", "Incorrect", "Well done!", "Amazing!"
- **Use**: "You spotted that sand doesn't dissolve — that's why filtering works for sand but not for salt. That's a really useful distinction."

**Rating**: ⚠️ *The assessment_guidance from the vehicle is good (3 clear questions). The feedback profile from the learner profile layer is excellent — it tells me exactly how to phrase feedback. However, there are no rubrics, no levelled assessment criteria, and no marking scheme. I had to build the full assessment plan myself.*

## 9. Common Misconceptions to Address ✅

All from graph (`SC-KS2-C048` and `SC-KS2-C049` common_misconceptions):

| Misconception | Correct Understanding | When to Address |
|--------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Dissolving = melting** | Dissolving requires a solvent (liquid); melting requires heat to change state. Sugar dissolves in water; ice melts in warm air. | Vocabulary introduction + weighing demo |
| **Dissolved substances have "gone forever"** | The substance is still present — weighing before and after proves this. Evaporation recovers the dissolved substance. | Weighing demonstration (main activity) |
| **Stirring makes more solid dissolve** | Stirring speeds up dissolving but doesn't change how much will dissolve (at a given temperature). | During practical if observed |
| **Filtering can separate dissolved substances** | Filtering only catches insoluble solids. Dissolved substances pass through filter paper — evaporation is needed. | Plenary / extension task |
| **Sieving = filtering** | Sieving separates solids by particle size; filtering separates insoluble solids from liquids. | Demonstration phase |
| **Once mixed, substances can never be separated** | Different properties allow different separation methods — the technique depends on whether the substance is dissolved, magnetic, different-sized, etc. | Mystery mixture challenge |

**Rating**: ✅ *Excellent. The graph provides detailed, specific misconceptions for both concepts. These are well-written, curriculum-accurate, and directly usable. This is one of the strongest data points in the graph.*

## 10. Worked Examples / Model Investigations ❌

### From graph:
- The content vehicle provides `expected_outcome`: "Different mixtures require different separation methods based on particle size and solubility. Dissolving and filtering are reversible. Burning and cooking are irreversible."
- The `recording_format`: "method diagram for each separation -> results table -> reversible vs irreversible sorting activity"

### Invented (not in graph):
#### Model method diagram (teacher example — filtering sand from water):
```
[Sand + Water mixture in beaker]
        ↓ pour through
[Filter funnel with filter paper]
        ↓               ↓
[Filtrate: clean    [Residue: sand
 water in beaker]    on filter paper]
```

#### Model results table:
| Mixture | Technique Used | What Happened | Successful? |
|---------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| Rice + flour | Sieving | Rice stayed in sieve, flour fell through | Yes |
| Sand + water | Filtering | Sand stayed on filter paper, water passed through | Yes |
| Salt + water | Evaporation | Water evaporated, salt crystals left behind | Yes |

**Rating**: ❌ *The graph has no worked examples, model diagrams, or recording templates. The recording_format property tells me WHAT to record (method diagram -> results table -> sorting) but not HOW to model it. I had to invent the method diagram format, the results table structure, and the model entries entirely. This is a critical gap for science — pupils need to see what a good scientific diagram looks like before they produce their own.*

---

## 11. Practice Questions / Follow-up Investigations ⚠️

### From graph (partial):
- Vehicle `enquiry_type: fair_test` suggests follow-up investigations should involve controlling variables
- Teaching guidance for C048 suggests: "Investigate factors that affect dissolving rate: temperature, stirring, grain size"
- Thinking lens question stems: "What would happen if we changed just one thing?"

### Invented practice questions:

**Recall (from misconceptions):**
1. Priya says: "When sugar dissolves in water, it disappears." Is she correct? Explain your answer.
2. What is the difference between dissolving and melting? Give one example of each.

**Application:**
3. A farmer needs to separate a mixture of gravel, sand, and salt. Put these steps in the right order: filter, dissolve in water, sieve, evaporate.
4. Amir tries to filter salt from salt water. It doesn't work. Explain why, and suggest what he should do instead.

**Investigation (follow-up fair test from teaching guidance):**
5. "Does hot water dissolve sugar faster than cold water?" Plan a fair test. What will you change? What will you measure? What will you keep the same?

**Rating**: ⚠️ *The teaching guidance gives follow-up investigation ideas (dissolving rate factors), and the misconceptions provide excellent fodder for diagnostic questions. But there are no ready-made practice questions, worksheets, or follow-up activities in the graph. I wrote all 5 questions myself.*

---

## 12. Cross-Curricular Links ⚠️

### From graph (limited):
- **Maths** (`MA-Y5-C017`): Reading and Interpreting Graphs, Tables and Timetables — directly relevant to recording results in tables and potentially creating bar charts of dissolving rates
- **Working Scientifically** → **Maths**: recording data in varied formats, making systematic measurements

### Invented cross-curricular links (not in graph):
- **English**: Writing a scientific report using appropriate connectives (first, then, therefore, because, however)
- **Maths — Measurement**: Measuring water volumes in ml, weighing in grams (Y5 measurement objectives)
- **Maths — Statistics**: If conducting dissolving rate investigation, plotting a bar chart of dissolving times at different temperatures
- **Design & Technology**: Designing a water purification system using learned separation techniques
- **Geography**: Link to water purification and access to clean water (global citizenship)
- **PSHE**: Discussing environmental impact of water pollution and why separation/purification matters

**Rating**: ⚠️ *The graph has one explicit Maths cross-curricular link via concept search, and the WS skills implicitly link to Maths data handling. But there are no explicit CROSS_CURRICULAR or LINKS_TO relationships in the graph model. All subject-to-subject links were inferred or invented.*

---

## Safety Notes ⚠️

### From graph (`SC-KS2-CV010.safety_notes`):
> "Wear safety goggles during evaporation. Teacher supervises heating. Do not taste solutions."

### Additional safety notes (invented — essential for this lesson):
- Iron filings: avoid contact with eyes and skin; use trays to contain filings; sweep up immediately if spilled
- Glass funnels and beakers: handle with care; report any cracks; place on non-slip mats
- Hot water / heat source: teacher-only zone; pupils must not approach the water bath or hot plate unsupervised
- Allergies: check for any allergies before handling materials (rare but possible with iron filings)
- Spills: paper towels on tables; mop immediately to prevent slipping
- Hygiene: wash hands after handling all materials; do not eat or drink during practical work
- Disposal: salt water down sink; sand and iron filings in waste bin, not down sink

**Rating**: ⚠️ *The vehicle provides 3 basic safety notes — better than nothing, but woefully insufficient for a real Y5 practical lesson. Any science coordinator would need to add hazard-specific notes (iron filings, glass, heat), spillage procedures, disposal instructions, and allergy checks. The graph needs a structured safety_hazards property with hazard, precaution, and first_aid fields.*
