# Lesson Plan: Light Sources, Vision, and Shadow Formation

**Teacher:** Ms. Chen (NQT+2), Year 3, Sheffield
**Cluster:** SC-KS2-D005-CL001 — *Investigate light sources, vision, and the formation of shadows*
**Cluster type:** Introduction
**Domain:** SC-KS2-D005 — Light
**Subject:** Science (KS2)
**Duration:** 60 minutes
**Content Vehicle:** SC-KS2-CV007 — Light and Shadows (investigation, fair_test)
**Thinking Lens:** Cause and Effect (primary), Patterns (secondary)

---

## 1. Learning Objectives ✅

**Conceptual objectives (from graph):**
- Recognise that we need light in order to see things and that dark is the absence of light (SC-KS2-O025)
- Recognise that shadows are formed when the light from a light source is blocked by an opaque object (SC-KS2-O028)
- Find patterns in the way that the size of shadows change (SC-KS2-O029)
- Notice that light is reflected from surfaces (SC-KS2-O026)
- Recognise that light from the sun can be dangerous and that there are ways to protect their eyes (SC-KS2-O027)

**Working Scientifically objectives (from graph — WS-KS2 skills):**
- Ask relevant questions and select the enquiry type (WS-KS2-001)
- Make systematic observations and measurements (WS-KS2-002)
- Record data in varied formats (WS-KS2-005) — results table
- Classify and identify patterns in data (WS-KS2-004)

**Rating rationale:** All five statutory Light objectives for Y3 are present in the graph with full descriptions. The Working Scientifically skills are rich (8 skills at KS2 level with progression notes). However, the graph does not distinguish which WS objectives belong to Y3 vs Y5/6 — Lower KS2 WS is not separated from Upper KS2 WS. I selected the age-appropriate subset myself.

## 2. Success Criteria ⚠️

**From content vehicle (SC-KS2-CV007):**
- Explain that light travels in straight lines
- Explain how shadows are formed by opaque objects blocking light
- Predict and test how shadow size changes with distance
- Draw a ray diagram showing how we see objects (light source -> object -> eye)

**Adapted for Y3 (teacher-modified):**
1. I can name different light sources (sun, torch, candle, lamp)
2. I can explain that we need light to see and that dark is the absence of light
3. I can sort materials as opaque, translucent, or transparent
4. I can explain that shadows form when an opaque object blocks light
5. I can predict whether a shadow will get bigger or smaller when I move the object

**Rating rationale:** The content vehicle provides success criteria but they span the whole KS2 Light domain (Y3-Y6). The ray diagram criterion is Y6, not Y3. The graph has no year-group tagging on success criteria, so I had to strip out the Y6 content (straight-line model, ray diagrams) and rewrite for Y3. The vehicle's `assessment_guidance` similarly mixes Y3 and Y6 expectations.

---

## 3. Prior Knowledge Required ✅

**From graph prerequisites:**
- Material Properties (SC-KS1-C026, from KS1 Everyday Materials domain SC-KS1-D004)
  - Children should already know that objects are made of materials and can describe properties like hard/soft, rough/smooth, transparent/opaque

**From co-teaches relationships:**
- SC-KS2-C024 (Shadow Formation) co-teaches with SC-KS2-C022 (Light and Vision) — confirms these two concepts are designed to be taught together in this cluster

**Rating rationale:** The prerequisite chain is clear: KS1 Materials -> KS2 Light. The graph explicitly links SC-KS1-C026 (Material Properties) as the prerequisite for SC-KS2-C022 (Light and Vision). This is accurate — children need to know about material properties (opaque, transparent) before classifying how materials interact with light. However, there's no check for whether children can name light sources from everyday experience, which I'd normally assess informally before this lesson.

## 4. Lesson Structure with Timings ⚠️

**Graph pedagogy profile suggests:** challenge_problem -> guided_exploration -> worked_example -> independent_practice -> retrieval_practice (session length 12-20 min for digital sessions)

**Adapted for 60-minute classroom lesson:**

### Starter / Introduction (10 minutes)

**Dark Den Challenge** (Productive Failure — graph says appropriate for Y3)
- Children enter the "dark den" (a reading corner blacked out with bin bags and tape)
- Challenge question: *"What can you see? Why?"*
- Use Thinking Lens key question: *"What caused this to happen, and how do we know?"*
- Children discuss in pairs: *Can you see in complete darkness? Why not?*
- Class discussion: Establish that we need light to see; dark is the absence of light

**Misconception check (from graph — SC-KS2-C022):**
- Address: "Can we see in the dark if we wait long enough?" → No, complete darkness means no light at all
- Address: "Is darkness a thing?" → No, darkness is the absence of light, not a substance

**Safety message (from objective SC-KS2-O027):**
- Never look directly at the sun — it can damage your eyes
- We use sunglasses and hats to protect our eyes from bright sunlight

### Main Activity (35 minutes)

**Part A: Light Sources Sort (10 minutes)**
- Give each table a set of picture cards: sun, torch, candle, lamp, moon, mirror, bicycle reflector, glow-worm, TV screen, star
- Sort into two groups: *things that make their own light* (luminous) vs *things that reflect light* (non-luminous)
- Key vocabulary introduction: **luminous**, **light source**, **reflect**
- Discuss: Is the moon a light source? (Misconception from graph: "Children often believe the Moon produces its own light — it reflects sunlight")

**Part B: Shadow Investigation (25 minutes)** — Fair Test (from content vehicle enquiry_type)
- **Equipment (from content vehicle):** torches, opaque objects (toy figures, cardboard cut-outs), white screen/card, ruler, metre stick
- **Additional equipment (teacher-supplied, not in graph):** transparent objects (clear plastic cup), translucent objects (tissue paper, greaseproof paper), pencils, recording sheets

**Step 1: Material sorting** (5 min)
- Shine torch through different materials
- Sort as opaque / translucent / transparent
- Key vocabulary: **opaque** (blocks all light), **translucent** (lets some light through), **transparent** (lets most light through)

**Step 2: Shadow size investigation** (15 min)
- *Variables from content vehicle:*
  - Independent variable: distance between light source and object
  - Dependent variable: size of shadow (cm height)
  - Controlled variables: same light source, same object, same screen distance, darkened room
- Children work in pairs: move a toy figure at 10cm intervals from the torch (10cm, 20cm, 30cm, 40cm, 50cm)
- Measure shadow height on the screen with a ruler
- Record in a results table (recording format from vehicle: results table)

**Step 3: Record and discuss** (5 min)
- Use Patterns lens question stems:
  - *"What pattern can you see?"*
  - *"Does this always happen?"*
  - *"What would you predict if we moved the object to 60cm?"*

### Plenary (15 minutes)

**Part A: Class results sharing (5 minutes)**
- Two groups share their results tables on the visualiser
- *"Did everyone find the same pattern?"*
- Establish the rule: closer to the light = bigger shadow

**Part B: Sorting activity (5 minutes)**
- Whole-class drag-to-categorise style activity (physical version on the board)
- Categories: *Makes a shadow* / *Doesn't make a shadow* / *Makes a faint shadow*
- Objects: wooden block, glass of water, tissue paper, hand, book, cling film

**Part C: Exit ticket (5 minutes)**
- Three questions (adapted from interaction types — multiple choice 3 options):
  1. Why can we not see in a completely dark room? (A: There is no light / B: Our eyes are closed / C: The dark gets in the way)
  2. What happens to a shadow when you move the object closer to the light? (A: It gets smaller / B: It gets bigger / C: It stays the same)
  3. Which word means "blocks all light"? (A: Transparent / B: Translucent / C: Opaque)

**Rating rationale:** The graph's pedagogy sequence is designed for a 12-20 minute digital session, not a 60-minute classroom lesson. I adapted it significantly. The content vehicle gives excellent investigation structure (variables, equipment, recording format) which maps well to the main activity. However, the graph provides no timing guidance for classroom lessons — only digital session lengths. I invented the 10/35/15 split and all the physical classroom logistics (dark den, picture cards, visualiser work, exit tickets).

## 5. Key Vocabulary with Definitions ✅

**From graph (SC-KS2-C022 key vocabulary + SC-KS2-C024 key vocabulary, deduplicated):**

| Word | Definition (teacher-supplied — graph provides word lists only) |
|---|---|
| **light source** | Something that makes its own light (e.g. sun, torch, candle) |
| **luminous** | An object that produces its own light |
| **dark / darkness** | The absence of light — not a substance |
| **shadow** | A dark area formed when an opaque object blocks light |
| **opaque** | A material that blocks all light — you cannot see through it |
| **translucent** | A material that lets some light through — you can see shapes but not details |
| **transparent** | A material that lets most light through — you can see clearly through it |
| **reflect** | When light bounces off a surface |
| **light** | A form of energy that we can see |

**Rating rationale:** The graph provides comprehensive vocabulary lists per concept (16 words for C022, 15 for C024). However, it provides the words as flat comma-separated lists with no definitions. I had to write every definition myself. For Y3, I'd want child-friendly definitions with examples — the graph gives me the *words* but not the *explanations*.

## 6. Resources and Materials Needed ⚠️

**From content vehicle (SC-KS2-CV007):**
- Torches
- Opaque objects
- White screen/card
- Mirrors
- Ruler
- Metre stick

**Teacher-supplied additions (not in graph):**
- Black bin bags and tape for dark den
- Transparent objects (clear plastic cups, glass of water)
- Translucent objects (tissue paper, greaseproof paper, tracing paper)
- Picture cards of light sources / non-light sources (sun, moon, torch, candle, mirror, etc.)
- Recording sheets with pre-drawn results table
- Pencils
- Visualiser / interactive whiteboard
- Safety goggles (for torch handling — small hands + torches near faces)

**Rating rationale:** The content vehicle lists 6 items of equipment. This is a start but far from a complete resources list for a Y3 classroom. Missing: the dark den setup, sorting materials (transparent/translucent examples), picture cards for the starter, recording sheets, stationery. Most critically for Y3 practical work: no mention of age-appropriate torch size (standard torches are too big for 7-year-old hands — I'd want small LED penlights), no mention of table covers for darkened areas, no mention of whether children need safety goggles. The `safety_notes` on the vehicle say only "Do not shine torches directly into eyes. Supervise mirror use." — adequate but thin for Y3.

---

## 7. Differentiation (Support + Extension) ❌

**From graph:** Nothing. No differentiation data at all.

**Teacher-supplied differentiation:**

**Support (working towards expected):**
- Pre-teach vocabulary (opaque, transparent, translucent) with physical objects before the lesson
- Provide a simplified recording sheet with pictorial support (draw the shadow, circle bigger/smaller)
- Pair with a more confident partner for the investigation
- Reduce measurement demands: use "near / middle / far" instead of cm measurements
- Provide sentence stems: "The shadow got ______ because ______"

**Extension (greater depth):**
- Can you find an object that makes a coloured shadow? (Use coloured transparent sweet wrappers)
- What happens if you use TWO light sources? How many shadows does one object make?
- Predict the shadow size at 60cm, 70cm — does the pattern continue?
- Write a "Did you know?" fact card explaining why we can see the moon at night

**Rating rationale:** The graph has no differentiation data whatsoever. The DifficultyLevel nodes exist only for Y3 Maths (pilot). The learner profile gives scaffolding level ("moderate_to_high") and hint tiers (max 3) but these are for the digital platform, not classroom teaching. There is no data on SEN adaptations, EAL support, or gifted/talented extension. This is a significant gap for a classroom teacher — I invented everything in this section.

## 8. Assessment Opportunities ⚠️

**From content vehicle (assessment_guidance):**
> "Can pupils explain how shadows are formed using the concept of light travelling in straight lines? Can they predict how shadow size changes with distance? Can they draw a ray diagram showing how we see an object?"

**Y3-appropriate assessment (teacher-adapted):**

| When | What | How |
|---|---|---|
| Starter | Can children explain we need light to see? | Observe paired discussion in dark den |
| Part A | Can children sort luminous and non-luminous objects? | Check sorting cards — note misconceptions about the moon |
| Part B | Can children sort materials by opacity? | Check opaque/translucent/transparent groups |
| Part B | Can children follow the investigation procedure? | Observe: are they measuring shadow height systematically? |
| Part B | Can children identify the pattern? | Listen for "closer = bigger shadow" in discussion |
| Plenary | Can children apply vocabulary accurately? | Check exit ticket answers (3 questions) |

**Formative assessment notes:**
- Exit ticket provides quick summative check (3 multiple choice questions)
- Observation during investigation provides evidence of Working Scientifically skills
- Results tables can be collected and marked

**Rating rationale:** The content vehicle provides assessment_guidance but it mixes Y3 and Y6 expectations (ray diagrams are Y6). The learner profile mentions mastery threshold (5 correct in 7 days, 80%) which is for the digital platform's spaced retrieval, not for classroom assessment. The graph provides no rubric, no assessment criteria mapped to the success criteria, no formative assessment prompts. I built the assessment table entirely from my own teaching practice.

## 9. Common Misconceptions to Address ✅

**From graph (SC-KS2-C022 + SC-KS2-C024):**

| Misconception | Correct Understanding | When to Address |
|---|---|---|
| "We can see in complete darkness if we wait long enough" | Complete darkness means no light at all — we cannot see | Dark den starter |
| "Darkness is a substance that can be pushed away by light" | Darkness is the absence of light, not a substance | Dark den discussion |
| "The Moon produces its own light" | The Moon reflects sunlight — it is not luminous | Light source sorting activity |
| "Shadows have colour" | Shadows are areas where light is blocked — they have no colour of their own | Shadow investigation |
| "Shadows are reflections of objects" | Shadows form when light is blocked; reflections form when light bounces | Shadow investigation |
| "Shadows are always the same size as the object" | Shadow size depends on the distance between light source, object, and screen | Shadow size investigation |
| "Transparent objects have no effect on light" | Transparent objects can refract (bend) light passing through | Material sorting — note for teacher, don't teach refraction at Y3 |

**Rating rationale:** This is one of the graph's strongest areas. Each concept has 3-4 well-documented misconceptions that are specific, research-informed, and practically useful. The misconceptions name what children actually say/think, not just abstract errors. This directly informs my teaching — I can plan to surface and address each one. Excellent.

## 10. Worked Examples / Model Investigations ⚠️

**From content vehicle (SC-KS2-CV007):**
- Enquiry type: fair_test
- Variables: independent (distance light→object), dependent (shadow height cm), controlled (same torch, object, screen distance, darkened room)
- Recording format: results table -> line graph -> ray diagram
- Expected outcome: "Shadows form when opaque objects block light. Shadow size increases as the object moves closer to the light source."

**Teacher-supplied model investigation:**

**Model results table (I invented this):**

| Distance from torch (cm) | Shadow height (cm) |
|---|---|
| 10 | 42 |
| 20 | 28 |
| 30 | 20 |
| 40 | 16 |
| 50 | 13 |

**Model conclusion:** "I found that when the object was closer to the torch, the shadow was bigger. When the object was further from the torch, the shadow was smaller. The pattern is: closer = bigger shadow."

**Rating rationale:** The content vehicle provides the investigation structure (variables, recording format, expected outcome) which is very useful. However, there is no example data, no model write-up, no scaffold for what a Y3 conclusion looks like. The learner profile says "Worked examples: Required" and describes "Text + diagram narrated. Step-by-step with child input at key points" — but this is for the digital platform. I invented the model results table, the model conclusion, and would need to also create a physical demonstration sequence. The graph tells me *what to investigate* but not *how to model the investigation process for 7-year-olds*.

## 11. Practice Questions / Follow-Up Tasks ⚠️

**From graph interaction types (primary for Y3):**
- Multiple Choice — 3 Options
- Drag to Categorise (2-3 categories for Y3)
- Matching Pairs (4-5 pairs for Y3)
- Pattern Discovery — I Notice / I Wonder
- Text Input — Single Word

**Practice questions (teacher-written, using graph interaction type formats):**

**Multiple Choice (3 options):**
1. Which of these is a light source? (A: Mirror / B: Torch / C: Moon)
2. What is a shadow? (A: A reflection / B: A dark area where light is blocked / C: A dark substance)
3. What does "opaque" mean? (A: Lets all light through / B: Lets some light through / C: Blocks all light)

**Drag to Categorise (3 categories):**
- Categories: Opaque / Translucent / Transparent
- Items: cardboard, tissue paper, glass, wood, greaseproof paper, cling film, metal tin, tracing paper, clear plastic

**Matching Pairs (4 pairs):**
- Opaque → Blocks all light
- Transparent → Lets all light through
- Translucent → Lets some light through
- Luminous → Makes its own light

**Follow-up task:** Shadow diary — over the next week, draw your shadow at three different times of day (morning, lunchtime, home time). What pattern do you notice? (links to spacing interval 2-7 days from pedagogy profile)

**Rating rationale:** The graph provides interaction type specifications (number of options, number of pairs, age-appropriate limits) which is helpful for designing the question format. But there are zero actual practice questions in the graph. Every question above is teacher-written. The content vehicle has no question bank. The thinking lens provides question stems ("What caused this to happen?" / "What pattern can you see?") which are useful prompts but are not practice questions.

---

## 12. Cross-Curricular Links ⚠️

**From graph (CO_TEACHES cross-domain):**
- SC-KS2-C067 (Light Travels in Straight Lines) ↔ MA-Y5-C015 (Reflections and translations in all four quadrants)
  - Rationale: "Light investigation (angles of incidence/reflection) requires understanding of angles from Maths"
  - **Note:** This is a Y5/Y6 connection, not Y3-appropriate

**Teacher-identified cross-curricular links (not in graph):**
- **Maths (Y3):** Measuring in cm (ruler skills), recording data in tables, reading scales
- **English (Y3):** Scientific vocabulary, writing investigation conclusions, explanation texts
- **Art (Y3):** Shadow puppets, silhouettes, using light and dark in artwork
- **PSHE:** Sun safety — protecting eyes and skin
- **Geography:** Seasonal changes in daylight hours (links to seasons work from KS1)

**Rating rationale:** The graph has only one cross-domain link for the Light domain, and it's a Y5+ Maths connection that's irrelevant to my Y3 lesson. There are no cross-curricular links to English, Art, PSHE, or other subjects that Y3 teachers commonly exploit when teaching Light. The graph's cross-domain CO_TEACHES relationships are subject-internal (Science-Maths) rather than genuinely cross-curricular. This is a gap — primary teachers plan thematically and need these connections.
