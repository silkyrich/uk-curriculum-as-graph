## 1. Learning Objectives — ✅ Well supported

By the end of this lesson, pupils will be able to:

1. **Name and locate** the six major climate zones on a world map (tropical, subtropical, temperate, continental, polar, mountainous) and explain how latitude affects climate.
2. **Describe** the characteristics of at least three biomes (rainforest, desert, temperate deciduous forest) and explain how climate determines which biome develops.
3. **Label the key stages** of the water cycle (evaporation, condensation, precipitation, run-off, infiltration) and explain how they connect as a system.
4. **Apply the Systems lens** by identifying inputs, outputs and interactions within the water cycle, and predicting what happens when one part changes.

**Geographical skills objectives** (from graph: `GE-KS2-C002` DEVELOPS_SKILL links):
- Geographical enquiry — formulating questions about why biomes are distributed as they are
- Fieldwork: data collection and presentation — collecting and presenting local weather data

**Graph assessment:** The concept descriptions, teaching guidance, and thinking lens prompts provided enough to write clear, curriculum-aligned learning objectives. The geographical skills links (via DEVELOPS_SKILL) added the enquiry and fieldwork dimensions that make this genuinely geographical. However, the objectives are still at KS2 level without year-specific granularity — the graph cannot tell me whether this is better suited to Y3 or Y4 within KS2.

## 2. Success Criteria — ⚠️ Partially supported

**All pupils will:**
- Name the six major climate zones
- Sequence the stages of the water cycle in order
- Use the key vocabulary: climate zone, biome, tropical, temperate, polar, evaporation, condensation, precipitation

**Most pupils will:**
- Explain the relationship between latitude and climate
- Match biomes to their climate zones and describe characteristics of each
- Identify at least three components of the water cycle as a system and explain how they interact

**Some pupils will:**
- Explain why biome boundaries do not perfectly match latitude bands (altitude, ocean currents)
- Predict what would happen to a river system if precipitation patterns changed
- Use the Systems lens to compare the water cycle with another geographical system

**Graph assessment:** The concept descriptions and common misconceptions gave me enough to differentiate three tiers. The thinking lens "Systems and System Models" directly informed the higher-level success criteria. However, the graph has **no DifficultyLevel nodes for Geography** (pilot is Y3 Maths only), so I had to construct the progression myself. With DifficultyLevel sub-nodes (entry / developing / expected / greater_depth), this could be generated directly.

---

## 3. Prior Knowledge Required — ✅ Well supported

The graph specifies two prerequisite chains:

| Prerequisite | Source | What pupils should already know |
|---|---|---|
| **Weather and Climate** | `GE-KS1-D003` (Human and Physical Geography) | Difference between weather and climate; hot/cold places; seasonal patterns in the UK |
| **Latitude, Longitude and the Global Grid** | `GE-KS2-D001` (Locational Knowledge) | Lines of latitude; Equator, Tropics, Arctic/Antarctic Circles; how to locate places using coordinates |

**Prior knowledge check (starter activity):** Show a blank world map. Ask pupils to mark the Equator, Tropics and Poles. Quick-fire: "Is the UK in a hot or cold climate zone? How do you know?" This activates KS1 weather knowledge and the KS2 locational knowledge that is the prerequisite.

**Graph assessment:** The prerequisite chains are explicit and useful. They told me exactly what to check before starting. The concept descriptions for the prerequisites gave me enough detail to design the starter check.

## 4. Lesson Structure with Timings — ⚠️ Partially supported

### Introduction (10 minutes)

| Time | Activity | Graph source |
|---|---|---|
| 0-3 min | **Challenge problem (productive failure):** Display a world map showing vegetation photographs from 6 locations (rainforest, desert, tundra, deciduous forest, savannah, coniferous forest). No labels. Ask: "Why do these places look so different? What might explain the patterns?" Pupils discuss in pairs. | Pedagogy profile: challenge_problem first; ThinkingLens: "What patterns can I notice?" |
| 3-7 min | **Elicit prior knowledge:** Draw out connections to KS1 weather knowledge and latitude work. Cold-call: "Which of these places do you think is closest to the Equator? Why?" | Prerequisite links from graph |
| 7-10 min | **Introduce the Systems lens:** "Today we are going to think about the Earth as a system — where different parts are connected. If one part changes, other parts change too." Display the key question: *"What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?"* | ThinkingLens agent_prompt verbatim |

### Main Activity (35 minutes)

| Time | Activity | Graph source |
|---|---|---|
| 10-18 min | **Climate zones exploration:** Pairs receive a world map outline with latitude lines marked. Using an atlas, they colour-code the six climate zones. Teacher models the first (tropical) on the board, connecting it to the Equator. Socratic questioning: "What do you notice about where tropical zones are? What does that tell you about the relationship between latitude and temperature?" | Concept GE-KS2-C002 teaching guidance; Interaction type: inference_task Socratic sequence |
| 18-26 min | **Biomes matching:** Pupils receive 6 biome description cards and 6 photograph cards. They match biome to photo, then place each on their climate zone map. Discuss: which biome does the UK belong to? "What pattern can you see between climate zones and the types of plants that grow there?" Counter misconception: "Some pupils think all deserts are hot. Can anyone think of a cold desert?" (Antarctica, Gobi) | Concept GE-KS2-C002 misconceptions; Interaction type: matching_pairs (4-5 pairs for Y4) |
| 26-35 min | **Water cycle as a system:** Teacher draws the water cycle diagram collaboratively. Label: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, run-off, infiltration. Pupils drag-to-reorder the processes. Then apply the Systems lens: "What goes into this system? What comes out? If we changed one part — say, precipitation doubled — what would happen to rivers?" Connect to river systems: trace the River Trent (local to Nottingham) from source to mouth. | Concept GE-KS2-C003 teaching guidance; Interaction type: drag_reorder; ThinkingLens question stems |
| 35-45 min | **Enquiry task:** Pairs receive temperature and rainfall data for three locations (Nottingham, Manaus, Svalbard). They plot the data on pre-drawn axes and use it to identify each location's climate zone. "What evidence tells you which climate zone each place belongs to?" | GeographicalSkill link: geographical enquiry; ThinkingLens: Evidence lens (secondary); Interaction type: text_input_phrase |

### Plenary (15 minutes)

| Time | Activity | Graph source |
|---|---|---|
| 45-50 min | **Systems check:** Each table group receives a water cycle diagram with one process removed. They identify what is missing and explain what would happen to the system without it. Cold-call responses. | ThinkingLens: "If you changed this one part, what else would be affected?" |
| 50-55 min | **Retrieval practice:** 5 quick-fire multiple-choice questions interleaving climate zones, biomes and water cycle vocabulary. Misconception distractors: "Deserts are always hot" (wrong — cold deserts exist); "Rivers sometimes flow uphill" (wrong — gravity determines flow). | Pedagogy profile: retrieval_practice; Concept misconceptions; Interaction type: multi_choice_4 |
| 55-60 min | **I Notice / I Wonder:** Pupils write one "I notice..." (pattern they spotted) and one "I wonder..." (question they still have). Collect as exit tickets. Preview: "Next lesson, we will investigate how the physical world we learned about today affects where humans choose to live — settlements and economic geography." | Interaction type: pattern_discovery; Domain progression: leads to GE-KS2-D003-CL002 |

**Graph assessment:** The pedagogy profile gave me the session sequence (challenge_problem -> exploration -> instruction -> independent_practice -> retrieval_practice) and the Y4 learner constraints. The thinking lens question stems were directly usable in activities. The domain progression (CL001 -> CL002) told me how to preview the next lesson. However, the graph gives **no estimated teaching time** ("None lessons") and no guidance on whether this cluster suits a single 60-minute lesson or a multi-lesson sequence. I had to make that judgement myself.

## 5. Key Vocabulary with Definitions — ✅ Well supported

The graph provides key vocabulary for both concepts. Combined and deduplicated:

| Term | Definition (Y4-appropriate, max 18 words per sentence) |
|---|---|
| **climate zone** | A large area of the Earth with a similar pattern of temperature and rainfall. |
| **biome** | A large natural area defined by its climate and the type of plants that grow there. |
| **tropical** | The warm, wet climate zone found near the Equator. |
| **temperate** | The moderate climate zone found between the tropics and the polar regions. The UK is temperate. |
| **polar** | The very cold climate zone found near the North and South Poles. |
| **desert** | A biome with very little rainfall. Deserts can be hot or cold. |
| **rainforest** | A biome with heavy rainfall and dense vegetation, usually found in tropical zones. |
| **savannah** | A tropical grassland with scattered trees, found between rainforest and desert biomes. |
| **tundra** | A cold biome where the ground is frozen for most of the year. Few trees can grow. |
| **evaporation** | When water heats up and changes from liquid into water vapour (gas). |
| **condensation** | When water vapour cools down and changes from gas back into tiny water droplets. |
| **precipitation** | Water falling from clouds as rain, snow, sleet or hail. |
| **run-off** | Water that flows over the surface of the land into streams and rivers. |
| **infiltration** | Water soaking into the ground through the soil. |
| **river** | A large natural stream of water flowing towards the sea, a lake, or another river. |
| **source** | The place where a river begins, often a spring or hilltop. |
| **mouth** | The place where a river flows into the sea or a lake. |
| **tributary** | A smaller river or stream that flows into a larger river. |
| **drainage basin** | The area of land drained by a river and all its tributaries. |
| **erosion** | The wearing away of rock and soil by water, wind or ice. |
| **ecosystem** | A community of living things and their environment, working together as a system. |

**Graph assessment:** The `key_vocabulary` fields on both concepts gave me a comprehensive subject-specific word list. I wrote the definitions myself to match the Y4 content guidelines (Lexile 300-500L, max 18 words per sentence, FK grade max 3). The graph does not provide child-friendly definitions — just the terms. This is a gap.

## 6. Resources and Materials Needed — ❌ Not supported

The graph provides **no resource or material specifications**. Everything below I had to source myself:

| Resource | Purpose | Graph source |
|---|---|---|
| World map outlines (A3, with latitude lines pre-printed) | Climate zone colouring activity | ❌ Not in graph |
| Philip's Primary School Atlas (class set) | Locating climate zones and biomes | ❌ Not in graph |
| Biome photograph cards (6 sets: rainforest, desert, tundra, deciduous forest, savannah, coniferous forest) | Matching activity | ❌ Not in graph |
| Biome description cards (6 per set) | Matching activity | ❌ Not in graph |
| Water cycle diagram (blank and labelled versions) | Collaborative diagramming | ❌ Not in graph |
| Temperature and rainfall data cards (Nottingham, Manaus, Svalbard) | Enquiry task | ❌ Not in graph |
| Pre-drawn graph axes on A4 sheets | Data plotting | ❌ Not in graph |
| OS map extract: River Trent, Nottingham area (1:50,000) | Local river study | ❌ Not in graph |
| Whiteboard and markers | Teacher modelling | ❌ Not in graph |
| Exit ticket slips | I Notice / I Wonder plenary | ❌ Not in graph |

**This is the single biggest gap for Geography.** The subject is inherently resource-dependent: you cannot teach climate zones without maps, biomes without photographs, rivers without OS map extracts, or fieldwork without equipment lists. History has similar needs for sources, but Geography's requirement for specific map types, data sets, and fieldwork equipment is distinctive.

## 7. Differentiation — ⚠️ Partially supported

### Support (working towards expected)
- **Scaffolded map:** Pre-labelled climate zone boundaries — pupils colour rather than locate
- **Word bank:** Key vocabulary with simple definitions visible on desk
- **Structured water cycle template:** Diagram with boxes and arrows — pupils add labels from a provided list
- **Sentence starters** for enquiry task: "The data shows that ___ because ___"
- **Paired working** throughout

### Extension (greater depth)
- **Exception hunting:** "The UK is temperate, but can you find a place in the UK that has mountain climate characteristics? Why?" (Scottish Highlands)
- **System disruption:** "If global temperatures rise by 2 degrees, which biome boundaries would shift? How would this affect the water cycle in those areas?"
- **Cross-continental comparison:** Use data to compare Nottingham's climate with a tropical and polar location — write a geographical explanation of why they differ

**Graph assessment:** The learner profile (scaffolding: moderate, productive failure: appropriate, hint tiers: max 3) set the right parameters. The misconceptions gave me specific errors to scaffold against. The thinking lens question stems ("If you changed this one part, what else would be affected?") directly informed the extension task. However, there are **no DifficultyLevel nodes** for Geography concepts, so I could not generate differentiated task descriptions with entry/developing/expected/greater_depth tiers as the Y3 Maths pilot enables. I built the differentiation from professional judgement.

## 8. Assessment Opportunities — ⚠️ Partially supported

| Assessment point | What it assesses | Method | Graph source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prior knowledge check (starter) | Prerequisite: latitude, weather vs climate | Observation + cold-call | Prerequisite links |
| Climate zone map | Can pupils locate and name zones? | Map work (formative) | Concept GE-KS2-C002 |
| Biome matching | Can pupils connect climate to vegetation? | Matching pairs (formative) | Interaction type: matching_pairs |
| Water cycle ordering | Can pupils sequence the processes? | Drag-to-reorder (formative) | Interaction type: drag_reorder |
| Systems prediction | Can pupils reason about interconnections? | Discussion (formative) | ThinkingLens question stems |
| Data enquiry | Can pupils interpret climate data as evidence? | Written work (formative) | GeographicalSkill: enquiry |
| Quick-fire MCQ | Retrieval of key facts and vocabulary | Multiple choice (formative) | Interaction type: multi_choice_4 |
| Exit ticket | Pattern recognition + open questions | Written (formative) | Interaction type: pattern_discovery |

**Graph assessment:** The interaction types from the learner profile gave me assessment formats directly. The misconceptions gave me specific things to check for. However, the graph provides **no assessment criteria, mark schemes, or exemplar pupil responses**. The content vehicle layer (which might have `assessment_guidance`) has **zero vehicles for KS2 Geography**. For a formative assessment to be useful, I need to know what a "developing" versus "expected" response looks like for each task. The DifficultyLevel nodes (with `example_task`, `example_response`, `common_errors`) would solve this, but they do not exist for Geography.

---

## 9. Common Misconceptions to Address — ✅ Well supported

The graph provides detailed, specific misconceptions for both concepts:

| Misconception | Correction | Source |
|---|---|---|
| "Deserts are always hot" | Cold deserts exist: Antarctica and the Gobi are both deserts. A desert is defined by low rainfall, not by temperature. | GE-KS2-C002 misconceptions |
| "Climate zone = biome" (interchangeable) | Climate determines which biome can exist, but they are different concepts. A climate zone describes temperature and rainfall patterns; a biome describes the plants and animals that result. | GE-KS2-C002 misconceptions |
| "Tropical regions are always wet" | Tropical regions have wet and dry seasons. The savannah biome is tropical but has a long dry season. | GE-KS2-C002 misconceptions |
| "Rivers sometimes flow uphill" | Rivers always flow downhill, following gravity. Even when a river appears to flow in an unexpected direction, the land is sloping. | GE-KS2-C003 misconceptions |
| "The water cycle is a simple loop" | Water can take many different pathways: groundwater, evapotranspiration from plants, run-off, deep infiltration. The "loop" diagram is a simplified model. | GE-KS2-C003 misconceptions |
| "Rivers are separate from the water cycle" | Rivers are fed by precipitation and run-off; water in rivers evaporates back into the atmosphere. Rivers are part of the water cycle. | GE-KS2-C003 misconceptions |

**Graph assessment:** This is one of the strongest sections. Every concept has detailed, specific misconceptions with clear pedagogical advice on how to address them. These are directly teachable — I can plan misconception-busting activities around each one.

---

## 10. Worked Examples / Model Geographical Analysis — ❌ Not supported

The graph provides **no worked examples, model analyses, or exemplar geographical writing**. For this lesson I would need:

**Model I would create myself:**
> "Looking at the climate data for Manaus, Brazil, I can see that the average temperature is 27°C all year round and the annual rainfall is over 2,000mm. The latitude is 3°S — very close to the Equator. Using my climate zone map, I can see that Manaus is in the tropical zone. The high temperature and heavy rainfall tell me this is a tropical rainforest biome. If I compare this with Nottingham (52°N, average temperature 10°C, annual rainfall 650mm), Nottingham is much further from the Equator and has much lower temperatures and rainfall. This makes it a temperate climate zone with a deciduous forest biome."

This is the kind of modelled geographical analysis that Y4 pupils need to see before attempting their own enquiry task. The graph has no equivalent.

**What the graph would need:** ContentVehicle nodes for Geography (like those for History and Science) with `assessment_guidance` and exemplar responses, or DifficultyLevel nodes with `example_task` and `example_response` fields.

---

## 11. Practice Activities / Enquiry Tasks — ⚠️ Partially supported

### Activity 1: Climate Zone Mapping (supported by concept teaching guidance)
Pupils use an atlas to locate and colour-code climate zones on a world outline map. They annotate the Equator, Tropics and Poles. "What pattern do you notice about where tropical zones are found?"

### Activity 2: Biome Matching (supported by interaction type)
4-5 matching pairs: biome name + photograph. After matching, pupils place each pair on their climate zone map.

### Activity 3: Water Cycle Sequencing (supported by interaction type)
Drag-to-reorder: 6 water cycle processes in correct order. After ordering, pupils identify where each process takes place (ocean, atmosphere, land).

### Activity 4: Climate Data Enquiry (supported by geographical skills link)
Pairs analyse temperature and rainfall data for 3 locations and identify each location's climate zone. They present their findings as a labelled bar chart (cross-curricular: Maths — data handling).

### Activity 5: System Disruption Prediction (supported by thinking lens)
"What would happen to the water cycle in Nottingham if the average temperature increased by 5 degrees?" Pupils write a short geographical explanation using the sentence frame: "If ___ changed, then ___ would happen because ___."

**Graph assessment:** The interaction types told me the *format* of activities (matching pairs, drag-to-reorder, text input) and the thinking lens gave me the *cognitive framing* (Systems: what happens when something changes?). The teaching guidance gave general pedagogical direction. But the graph provides **no specific data sets, map extracts, photograph sets, or enquiry resources**. Geography lessons live or die on the quality of their resources, and I had to invent all of them.

---

## 12. Cross-Curricular Links — ⚠️ Partially supported

| Link | Detail | Graph source |
|---|---|---|
| **Maths — Data handling** | Plotting temperature and rainfall data on bar charts; comparing values across locations; calculating differences | CO_TEACHES links exist between Maths and Geography concepts in the graph, but none specific to this cluster |
| **Maths — Scale and proportion** | Reading map scales; understanding what 1cm represents in real distance | ThinkingLens: Scale, Proportion and Quantity (secondary lens for this cluster) |
| **English — Geographical writing** | Writing comparative geographical descriptions using conjunctions (however, whereas, similarly) | No direct link in graph |
| **Science — States of matter** | Water cycle connects directly to Y4 Science: solids, liquids, gases; evaporation and condensation | No cross-subject PREREQUISITE_OF or CO_TEACHES link in graph between Science states of matter and Geography water cycle |
| **History — Settlement** | Why Nottingham grew where it did (River Trent crossing, Nottingham Castle) — links to GE-KS2-D003-CL002 (settlements) | Domain progression in graph shows this cluster leads to settlements |

**Graph assessment:** The CO_TEACHES relationships exist in the graph but not at a useful level of specificity for this lesson. The most obvious cross-curricular link — Y4 Science states of matter ↔ the water cycle — is not captured anywhere. The thinking lens (Scale, Proportion and Quantity as secondary) hints at the Maths connection but does not make it explicit. Cross-curricular planning requires me to bring subject knowledge that the graph does not yet encode.

---

## Geography-Specific Observations

### What the graph does well for Geography:
1. **Concept descriptions are geographically rich** — they include teaching guidance mentioning maps, fieldwork, photographs, satellite images, and statistical data
2. **Geographical skills links (DEVELOPS_SKILL)** — the 4 linked skills for KS2 concepts give me a skills thread to weave through
3. **Misconceptions are specific and useful** — "rivers flow uphill" and "deserts are always hot" are exactly the misconceptions Y4 pupils hold
4. **Thinking lenses work well** — Systems and System Models is a genuinely useful framing for the water cycle; Patterns works for biome distribution
5. **Domain progression** — knowing this cluster leads to settlements tells me where the learning goes next

### What is critically missing for Geography:
1. **Zero ContentVehicles** — History has case studies, Science has investigations, English has text studies. Geography has nothing. This is the biggest structural gap.
2. **No map resources** — Geography without maps is not geography. The graph mentions maps in teaching guidance but cannot provide or link to actual map resources.
3. **No real-world data** — Climate data, population data, trade data, rainfall data — Geography is a data-rich subject and the graph holds none of it.
4. **No fieldwork scaffolds** — The graph links concepts to fieldwork skills but provides no fieldwork plans, risk assessments, data collection sheets, or local area resources.
5. **No place-specific knowledge** — The concept describes "a region in Europe or the Americas" but does not specify which regions, provide case study material, or link to place-specific resources.
6. **No photographs or visual resources** — Biome teaching requires high-quality photographs. The graph holds no image references or links.
7. **No DifficultyLevel nodes** — The Y3 Maths pilot shows what this could look like (entry/developing/expected/greater_depth with example tasks and responses). Geography has none.
