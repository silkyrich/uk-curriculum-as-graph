# Lesson Plan: Factors, Multiples, Primes, Squares and Cubes

**Teacher:** Mr. Sharma (Y5, Birmingham)
**Cluster:** MA-Y5-D003-CL001 — Understand factors, multiples, primes, squares and cubes
**Cluster type:** Introduction
**Subject/Year:** Mathematics / Year 5 (age 9-10)
**Key Stage:** KS2
**Domain:** Number - Multiplication and Division (MA-Y5-D003)
**Duration:** 60 minutes
**Date generated:** 2026-02-23

## 1. Learning Objectives ✅

**Source:** Graph — statutory objectives MA-Y5-O011, MA-Y5-O012, MA-Y5-O013, MA-Y5-O018, MA-Y5-O020

By the end of this lesson, pupils will be able to:

1. Identify factors and factor pairs of a number, and find common factors of two numbers (MA-Y5-O011)
2. Use the vocabulary of prime numbers, prime factors and composite numbers correctly (MA-Y5-O012)
3. Establish whether a number up to 100 is prime and recall prime numbers up to 19 (MA-Y5-O013)
4. Recognise and use square numbers and cube numbers, and the notation for squared (^2) and cubed (^3) (MA-Y5-O020)

**Rating rationale:** All four objectives are directly stated in the graph as statutory. Full coverage of the cluster's three concepts (MA-Y5-C003, C004, C005). No invention needed.

## 2. Success Criteria ⚠️

**Source:** Derived from graph concept descriptions + assessment content domain codes (5C5a-d)

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| All pupils | Can list all factor pairs of a number up to 50 |
| All pupils | Can state whether a given number under 20 is prime or composite |
| All pupils | Can calculate the first 5 square numbers using arrays |
| Most pupils | Can find all factor pairs of any number up to 100 |
| Most pupils | Can identify common factors of two numbers using systematic listing |
| Most pupils | Can recall all primes up to 19 and test primeness of numbers up to 100 |
| Most pupils | Can list square numbers to 144 and cube numbers to 125 |
| Some pupils | Can use HCF and LCM vocabulary and find HCF of two numbers |
| Some pupils | Can explain why 1 is neither prime nor composite |
| Some pupils | Can identify numbers that are both square and cube (1, 64) |

**Rating rationale:** Marked ⚠️ because the all/most/some thresholds are my professional judgement — the graph provides concept mastery descriptions but **no DifficultyLevel tiers** to ground the graduated expectations. I had to invent the boundary between "all" and "most" based on experience. With DifficultyLevel data (like brennan has for Y3), the entry/developing/expected/greater_depth labels would have given me concrete, assessable descriptions for each tier.

## 3. Prior Knowledge Required ✅

**Source:** Graph — PREREQUISITE_OF relationships

| Prerequisite | Source | What pupils need |
|---|---|---|
| MA-Y4-C009 — Factor pairs and commutativity | Y4 Multiplication & Division | Can find factor pairs of numbers to 100; understands commutativity (3 x 4 = 4 x 3) |
| MA-Y4-C007 — All multiplication tables to 12 x 12 | Y4 Multiplication & Division | Rapid recall of times tables; can use these to identify factors |

**Prerequisite gating check:** Both prerequisites are Y4 concepts. In a mastery classroom, these should be secure. I would use a 5-question entry ticket to verify:
1. "List all the factor pairs of 24" (tests MA-Y4-C009)
2. "What is 7 x 8?" (tests MA-Y4-C007 — rapid recall)
3. "Is 3 a factor of 18? How do you know?" (tests factor understanding)
4. "What is 12 x 12?" (tests upper boundary of tables)
5. "True or false: 5 x 6 = 6 x 5. Explain." (tests commutativity)

**Rating rationale:** Fully sourced from graph. The prerequisite chain is clear and gives me confidence about what to check. The entry ticket questions are my own — the graph doesn't provide diagnostic items.

---

## 4. Lesson Structure with Timings ⚠️

**Source:** Pedagogical structure from graph (PedagogyProfile: 20-30 min sessions, 6 activities, productive failure appropriate, faded worked examples required). Adapted to 60-minute classroom lesson.

### Phase 1: Activation and Productive Failure (10 minutes)

**Generation Effect technique** (graph: PedagogyTechnique — "ask child to recall before showing"):

> "Before we start, I want you to think back to Year 4. Write down everything you remember about factors. What is a factor? Can you give me an example?"

- 2 minutes: Individual think-write (generation effect)
- 3 minutes: Pair share — compare what you wrote
- 5 minutes: Whole class — collect responses on board, categorise into "secure knowledge" and "things we're not sure about"

**Pattern Discovery opener** (graph: InteractionType — "I Notice / I Wonder"):

Display on the board: **1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100**

> "I notice... I wonder..." — What do you notice about these numbers? What do you wonder?

Collect observations. Do NOT reveal they are square numbers yet.

### Phase 2: Main Teaching — Concept Introduction (35 minutes)

**Part A: Factors, Common Factors and HCF (12 minutes)** — Concept MA-Y5-C005

1. **Systematic factor pair listing** (graph teaching guidance): Start from 1 x n and work upward until factors meet.
   - Model: factors of 36 → 1x36, 2x18, 3x12, 4x9, 6x6. Stop — factors have met.
   - Faded worked example: factors of 48 → 1x48, 2x24, 3x16, 4x12, 6x8. Pupils complete factors of 60.

2. **Common factors via Venn diagram** (graph teaching guidance): Factors of 24 in one circle, factors of 36 in another, overlap = common factors.
   - HCF = largest number in the overlap = 12

3. **Connect to fractions** (graph cross-domain link MA-Y5-C005 ↔ MA-Y5-C008): "We need HCF to simplify fractions. 24/36 — HCF is 12 — so 24/36 = 2/3."

**Part B: Prime and Composite Numbers (12 minutes)** — Concept MA-Y5-C003

1. **Sieve of Eratosthenes** (graph teaching guidance): Give each pupil a 1-100 grid.
   - "Cross out 1 — it's special, neither prime nor composite."
   - "Circle 2. Now cross out every multiple of 2 except 2 itself."
   - "Circle 3. Cross out every multiple of 3 that isn't already crossed."
   - Continue with 5 and 7. "What's left? These are the prime numbers."

2. **Address misconception** (graph): "Is 1 prime? No — a prime has exactly TWO distinct factors. 1 has only one factor."

3. **Address misconception** (graph): "Are all odd numbers prime? What about 9? 9 = 3 x 3. It's odd but not prime."

4. **Rapid recall drill**: "Is 17 prime? Is 21 prime? Is 2 prime? Is 51 prime?" — Partner quiz.

**Part C: Square and Cube Numbers (11 minutes)** — Concept MA-Y5-C004

1. **Physical arrays** (graph teaching guidance): Use multilink cubes.
   - Build a 4x4 array → count = 16 = 4^2. "This is why we call them SQUARE numbers."
   - Build a 3x3x3 cube → count = 27 = 3^3. "This is why we call them CUBE numbers."

2. **Notation** (graph teaching guidance): Introduce ^2 and ^3 notation.
   - **Address misconception** (graph): "5^2 does NOT mean 5 x 2 = 10. It means 5 x 5 = 25."
   - **Address misconception** (graph): "4^3 does NOT mean 4 x 3 = 12. It means 4 x 4 x 4 = 64."

3. **Connection to measurement** (graph teaching guidance): "Area of a 5cm square = 5^2 = 25 cm^2. Volume of a 3cm cube = 3^3 = 27 cm^3."

4. **Link back to opener**: "Look at our 'I Notice / I Wonder' sequence: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25... These are the square numbers! 1^2, 2^2, 3^2..."

### Phase 3: Practice and Plenary (15 minutes)

**Interleaved practice** (graph: PedagogyTechnique — "mix different types, require problem-type identification"):

Practice set mixing all three concepts (6 questions, 8 minutes):

1. "List all the factor pairs of 42." (factors — MA-Y5-C005)
2. "Is 37 prime or composite? Explain how you know." (primes — MA-Y5-C003)
3. "What is 8^2? What is 3^3?" (squares/cubes — MA-Y5-C004)
4. "Find the common factors of 18 and 24." (common factors — MA-Y5-C005)
5. "True or false: 9 is a prime number. Prove it." (misconception — MA-Y5-C003)
6. "Which numbers are both square and under 50? List them all." (squares — MA-Y5-C004)

**Varied practice** (graph: PedagogyTechnique — "same structure, different surface"):
- Question 1 uses 42; repeat the same factor-pair structure with 56, then 72.

**Plenary — Drag to Categorise activity** (graph: InteractionType — primary for Y5):

> Sort these numbers into the correct categories: Prime / Composite / Square / Cube
> Numbers: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 16, 25, 27, 36, 49, 51, 64

(Note: some numbers belong in multiple categories — 4 is both composite and square; 64 is composite, square, AND cube.)

**Exit ticket** (3 minutes):
1. "Is 43 prime? How do you know?"
2. "What is 6^2?"
3. "Name a number that is a common factor of 20 and 30."

**Rating rationale:** ⚠️ because timing splits and activity sequencing are my professional judgement. The graph provides the pedagogy techniques and interaction types but doesn't specify how to combine them into a 60-minute lesson. The productive failure opener, faded worked examples, and interleaved practice structure are all directly from graph data.

## 5. Key Vocabulary with Definitions ✅

**Source:** Graph — key_vocabulary fields on each concept

| Term | Definition | Source concept |
|---|---|---|
| Factor | A number that divides another number exactly | MA-Y5-C005 |
| Factor pair | Two factors that multiply to give a number (e.g., 3 and 8 for 24) | MA-Y5-C005 |
| Multiple | The product of a number with any positive integer | MA-Y5-C005 |
| Common factor | A factor shared by two or more numbers | MA-Y5-C005 |
| Highest common factor (HCF) | The largest factor shared by two numbers | MA-Y5-C005 |
| Common multiple | A multiple shared by two numbers | MA-Y5-C005 |
| Lowest common multiple (LCM) | The smallest multiple shared by two numbers | MA-Y5-C005 |
| Prime number | A number with exactly two distinct factors: 1 and itself | MA-Y5-C003 |
| Composite number | A number with more than two factors | MA-Y5-C003 |
| Sieve of Eratosthenes | A method for finding all primes up to a given number | MA-Y5-C003 |
| Square number | The product of an integer multiplied by itself (n^2) | MA-Y5-C004 |
| Cube number | The product of an integer multiplied by itself three times (n^3) | MA-Y5-C004 |
| Squared / Cubed | Notation for ^2 and ^3 | MA-Y5-C004 |
| Divisible | Can be divided by a number with no remainder | MA-Y5-C005 |

**Rating rationale:** All vocabulary directly from graph key_vocabulary fields. Complete and well-defined. No invention needed.

---

## 6. Resources and Materials Needed ⚠️

**Source:** Partially from graph (teaching guidance references), partially invented

| Resource | Source |
|---|---|
| 1-100 number grids (one per pupil) | Graph teaching guidance (Sieve of Eratosthenes) |
| Multilink cubes (at least 64 per table) | Graph teaching guidance (physical arrays for squares/cubes) |
| Venn diagram templates | Graph teaching guidance (common factors) |
| Mini whiteboards and pens | Teacher invention (rapid recall drill) |
| Coloured pencils for sieve activity | Teacher invention |
| Square number reference chart | Graph teaching guidance ("display a reference chart") |
| Category sorting cards for plenary | Graph interaction type (Drag to Categorise) |

**Rating rationale:** ⚠️ — The graph provides teaching guidance that implies certain resources (cubes, grids, Venn diagrams) but does not have an explicit resources/materials list. I had to infer and supplement. A `resources_needed` property on ContentVehicle or ConceptCluster would fix this.

**Content Vehicles:** No Mathematics KS2 content vehicles exist in the graph (0 results from query). This is a significant gap — History and Science have vehicles but Maths does not. A worked example set vehicle for this cluster would be highly valuable.

---

## 7. Differentiation (Support + Extension) ⚠️ → ❌

**Source:** Graph provides concept descriptions with mastery expectations, misconceptions, and teaching guidance. **NO DifficultyLevel data exists for Y5 Maths** (confirmed: 0 DifficultyLevel nodes).

### What I had to invent (and why it matters)

The graph tells me WHAT to teach (concepts, objectives) and HOW to teach it (pedagogy techniques, interaction types), but it does NOT tell me how to **grade the difficulty** within a concept. I had to invent all of the following differentiation from professional experience:

### Support (Lower-attaining / SEN)

| Strategy | Invented or from graph? |
|---|---|
| Reduce number range: factor pairs of numbers up to 30 only | **INVENTED** — no entry-level tier defined |
| Provide a multiplication square as a scaffold | **INVENTED** — graph mentions tables recall as prereq but doesn't specify scaffolds |
| Pre-printed Venn diagram with factors of 12 already completed | **INVENTED** — no partial-completion scaffold defined |
| Limit primes to "up to 20" rather than "up to 100" | **INVENTED** — graph gives the full statutory range; I reduced it |
| Physical cubes only for squares/cubes (no notation yet) | **INVENTED** — no CRA staging defined for this concept |

### Core (Age-related expectations)

As per the lesson plan above — directly from graph concept mastery descriptions.

### Extension (Greater depth)

| Strategy | Invented or from graph? |
|---|---|
| Find HCF and LCM of three numbers | **INVENTED** — concept description mentions two numbers |
| Investigate: "Is the sum of two primes always even?" (Goldbach) | **INVENTED** — no enrichment tasks provided |
| Find numbers that are both square and cube (perfect sixth powers) | **PARTIALLY from graph** — teaching guidance mentions 1 and 64 |
| Express composite numbers as products of prime factors | **PARTIALLY from graph** — concept description mentions "prime factor decomposition (informally)" |

### Impact of Missing DifficultyLevel Data

**This is the single biggest gap in my planning.**

With DifficultyLevel data (as brennan has for Y3 Maths), I would have:
- **entry** tier: concrete, scaffolded tasks — exactly calibrated to the lower boundary
- **developing** tier: partially independent tasks
- **expected** tier: the statutory standard — what "most pupils" means
- **greater_depth** tier: tasks with explicit example_task, example_response, and common_errors

Instead, I had to:
1. **Guess** where the difficulty boundaries fall
2. **Invent** support scaffolds with no evidence base from the graph
3. **Invent** extension tasks with no guarantee they're appropriate for Y5
4. **Hope** my professional judgement about "entry level" aligns with assessment expectations

**Confidence level:** 4/10 for my invented differentiation vs. what I estimate would be 8/10 with DifficultyLevel data grounding each tier.

## 8. Assessment Opportunities ✅

**Source:** Graph — content domain codes (5C5a-d, 5C6a) + mastery threshold from PedagogyProfile

| Assessment Point | Content Domain Code | When |
|---|---|---|
| Factor pair listing fluency | 5C5a, 5C5d | Part A practice |
| Prime identification and reasoning | 5C5b | Part B rapid recall + exit ticket Q1 |
| Square and cube number recall + notation | 5C5c | Part C + exit ticket Q2 |
| Common factors and HCF | 5C5a | Part A Venn diagram + exit ticket Q3 |
| Mental multiplication/division using factors | 5C6a | Throughout (interleaved practice) |

**Mastery threshold** (graph): 5 correct in 7 days (80%)
**Spacing** (graph): Return to this content after 3-14 day interval

**Rating rationale:** Assessment content domain codes map directly to the cluster concepts. The graph provides excellent assessment alignment data.

---

## 9. Common Misconceptions to Address ✅

**Source:** Graph — common_misconceptions fields on each concept

| Misconception | Concept | How to Address |
|---|---|---|
| "1 is a prime number" | MA-Y5-C003 | Explicit: "A prime has exactly TWO factors. 1 has only one. 1 is special — neither prime nor composite." |
| "All odd numbers are prime" | MA-Y5-C003 | Counter-example: "Is 9 prime? 9 = 3 x 3. It's odd but composite." Also 15, 21, 25. |
| "2 can't be prime because it's even" | MA-Y5-C003 | "2 has exactly two factors: 1 and 2. That's the definition of prime. It's the only even prime." |
| "5^2 means 5 x 2 = 10" | MA-Y5-C004 | Physical array: build a 5x5 grid. Count: 25. "Squared means multiplied by itself." |
| "4^3 means 4 x 3 = 12" | MA-Y5-C004 | Physical cube: build 4x4x4. Count: 64. "Cubed means multiplied by itself three times." |
| "Factors and multiples are the same" | MA-Y5-C005 | "Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 (they divide 12). Multiples of 12: 12, 24, 36... (12 times something). Factors go down, multiples go up." |
| "Stopping too early when listing factors" | MA-Y5-C005 | Teach the systematic method: "Stop when the factor pair numbers meet or cross." |
| "HCF means multiply the factors together" | MA-Y5-C005 | "HCF is the HIGHEST factor they SHARE — find it in the Venn diagram overlap." |

**Rating rationale:** Comprehensive misconception data directly from graph. Each concept has 3-4 specific, well-described misconceptions with pedagogical counter-strategies. This is one of the strongest sections of the graph data.

---

## 10. Worked Examples (Step-by-Step) ⚠️

**Source:** Graph teaching guidance provides method descriptions. **No DifficultyLevel data** means no grounded example_task or example_response to draw from.

### Worked Example 1: Finding all factor pairs of 48

| Step | Working | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 x 48 | Start with 1. 1 is always a factor. |
| 2 | 2 x 24 | Is 48 divisible by 2? Yes (it's even). 48 / 2 = 24. |
| 3 | 3 x 16 | Is 48 divisible by 3? 4+8=12, 12 is divisible by 3. 48 / 3 = 16. |
| 4 | 4 x 12 | Is 48 divisible by 4? Yes. 48 / 4 = 12. |
| 5 | 6 x 8 | Is 48 divisible by 5? No (doesn't end in 0 or 5). Divisible by 6? Yes. 48 / 6 = 8. |
| 6 | STOP | Next would be 7. 7 x 7 = 49 > 48. So we've found all pairs. |

**Factor pairs of 48:** (1,48), (2,24), (3,16), (4,12), (6,8)

### Worked Example 2: Is 51 prime?

| Step | Working | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Check: is 51 even? No. | Not divisible by 2. |
| 2 | Check: digit sum? 5+1=6. Divisible by 3. | 51 / 3 = 17. |
| 3 | 51 = 3 x 17 | 51 has factors other than 1 and itself. |
| 4 | **51 is composite.** | It has more than two factors. |

### Worked Example 3: Square and cube number notation

| Expression | Read as | Calculation | Answer |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6^2 | "six squared" | 6 x 6 | 36 |
| 4^3 | "four cubed" | 4 x 4 x 4 | 64 |
| 10^2 | "ten squared" | 10 x 10 | 100 |
| 5^3 | "five cubed" | 5 x 5 x 5 | 125 |

### Faded Worked Example (from graph PedagogyProfile: "child completes partial worked examples"):

**Find all factor pairs of 60:**

| Step | Working | Your turn |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 x 60 | (given) |
| 2 | 2 x 30 | (given) |
| 3 | 3 x ___ | Complete: 60 / 3 = ? |
| 4 | ___ x ___ | Is 60 divisible by 4? Find the pair. |
| 5 | ___ x ___ | Is 60 divisible by 5? Find the pair. |
| 6 | ___ x ___ | Is 60 divisible by 6? Find the pair. |
| 7 | STOP when? | When should you stop checking? |

**Rating rationale:** ⚠️ — I constructed these worked examples from the graph's teaching guidance (systematic factor pair method, sieve approach, notation introduction). The method is well-described in the graph. However, **without DifficultyLevel data, I have no graph-sourced example_task or example_response**. The specific numbers I chose (48, 51, 60) are my professional judgement. With DifficultyLevels, I would have had:
- An **entry** example (e.g., factor pairs of 12 — small, familiar)
- A **developing** example (e.g., factor pairs of 36 — medium)
- An **expected** example (e.g., factor pairs of 48 — meeting statutory standard)
- A **greater_depth** example (e.g., factor pairs of 96 — extending beyond)

Each with a pre-written example_task and example_response validated against the curriculum. Instead, I'm using my teaching experience to pick appropriate numbers.

## 11. Practice Questions (Graduated Difficulty) ⚠️ → ❌

**Source:** Question types from graph (interleaved practice, varied practice techniques). Difficulty graduation **entirely invented** — no DifficultyLevel data.

### Set A: Factors and Common Factors

| # | Question | Intended difficulty | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | List all the factor pairs of 24. | Entry | **INVENTED** |
| 2 | List all the factor pairs of 36. | Developing | **INVENTED** |
| 3 | Find the common factors of 12 and 18. | Expected | **INVENTED** |
| 4 | Find the HCF of 24 and 36. | Expected | **INVENTED** |
| 5 | Find the HCF of 48 and 72. | Greater depth | **INVENTED** |

### Set B: Primes

| # | Question | Intended difficulty | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Circle the prime numbers: 2, 5, 9, 11, 15 | Entry | **INVENTED** |
| 2 | Is 29 prime? Explain. | Developing | **INVENTED** |
| 3 | Is 91 prime? Show your working. | Expected | **INVENTED** |
| 4 | "All prime numbers are odd." Is this true? Prove it. | Greater depth | **INVENTED** |

### Set C: Squares and Cubes

| # | Question | Intended difficulty | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | What is 3^2? What is 2^3? | Entry | **INVENTED** |
| 2 | List all square numbers up to 100. | Developing | **INVENTED** |
| 3 | Which number is both a square number and a cube number between 1 and 100? | Expected | **INVENTED** |
| 4 | If n^2 = 144, what is n? If m^3 = 125, what is m? | Greater depth | **INVENTED** |

### Interleaved Set (from graph PedagogyTechnique)

| # | Question | Concept | Difficulty |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | What are the factor pairs of 30? | Factors | Developing |
| 2 | Is 23 prime or composite? | Primes | Developing |
| 3 | What is 7^2? | Squares | Entry |
| 4 | Find the common factors of 16 and 24. | Common factors | Expected |
| 5 | Is 49 prime, square, or both? Explain. | Mixed | Expected |
| 6 | What is the smallest number that is both a multiple of 6 and a multiple of 8? | LCM | Greater depth |

**Rating rationale:** ⚠️→❌ — This is the section most damaged by the absence of DifficultyLevel data. Every difficulty label above is my invention. I have:
- **No graph-sourced entry/developing/expected/greater_depth descriptions** for these concepts
- **No validated example_tasks** at each level
- **No common_errors per level** (the graph has concept-level misconceptions but not level-specific ones)
- **No example_responses** showing what a correct answer looks like at each tier

Compare with what brennan gets for Y3 Maths: each concept has 3-4 DifficultyLevel nodes with `description`, `example_task`, `example_response`, and `common_errors` — all grounded in KS2 statutory assessment labels. That data would transform this section from "teacher best guess" to "evidence-grounded graduated practice."

---

## 12. Cross-Curricular Links ⚠️

**Source:** Graph — cross-domain CO_TEACHES relationships + ThinkingLens

### Within Mathematics (from graph)

| Link | Source | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| MA-Y5-C005 (Factors/HCF/LCM) ↔ MA-Y5-C008 (Adding fractions with different denominators) | Cross-domain CO_TEACHES | LCM needed for common denominators; HCF for simplifying |
| MA-Y5-C006 (Long multiplication) ↔ MA-Y5-C014 (Volume of cuboids) | Cross-domain CO_TEACHES | Volume = L x W x H requires multi-digit multiplication |

### Thinking Lens Connections (from graph)

| Lens | Application to this cluster | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Scale, Proportion and Quantity** (rank 1, primary) | "How many times bigger is this than that?" — connects factors to proportional reasoning | Graph APPLIES_LENS |
| **Patterns** (rank 2) | "What pattern can you see in the square numbers? Does this always happen?" — connects to generalisation | Graph APPLIES_LENS |

### Cross-Subject (invented)

| Subject | Connection | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Science | Prime numbers in nature (cicada cycles) | **INVENTED** — no cross-subject links in graph for this cluster |
| Computing | Prime numbers in cryptography (age-appropriate mention) | **INVENTED** |

**Rating rationale:** ⚠️ — Within-maths cross-domain links are excellent (graph-sourced). ThinkingLens connections with age-banded prompts are very useful. Cross-subject links are invented — the graph has DEVELOPS_SKILL for Science concepts but no equivalent for Maths→Science conceptual connections.

---

## Thinking Lens Integration

**Primary lens:** Scale, Proportion and Quantity
**Agent prompt (KS2):** "Use the SCALE, PROPORTION AND QUANTITY lens: prompt pupils to measure and compare using standard units, understand simple fractions and proportions, use bar models or diagrams to show relative size..."

**Key question to weave through the lesson:** "How big, how many, or how much — and how does that change how we think about it?"

**Suggested question stems (from graph):**
- "How many times bigger is this than that?" → Use when comparing factor pairs
- "What fraction of the whole is this part?" → Use when connecting factors to fractions
- "Which unit of measurement fits best here? Why?" → Use when connecting squares to area, cubes to volume
