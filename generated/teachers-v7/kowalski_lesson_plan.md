## 1. Learning Objectives ✅

**Data source**: Cluster concepts (EN-Y4-C052, C055, C056, C057) — all four have explicit curriculum statements.

By the end of this lesson, pupils will:

1. Use a wider range of subordinating conjunctions (although, while, until, since) to extend sentences with more than one clause *(EN-Y4-C052)*
2. Use conjunctions, adverbs and prepositions to express time and cause in their writing *(EN-Y4-C055)*
3. Use fronted adverbials for effect and punctuate them correctly with a comma *(EN-Y4-C056)*
4. Punctuate direct speech accurately, including comma after the reporting clause, inverted commas, and end punctuation inside the speech marks *(EN-Y4-C057)*

**Curriculum link**: "Pupils extend the range of sentences with more than one clause... using fronted adverbials... use and punctuate direct speech fully" (National Curriculum, English — Writing: Vocabulary, Grammar and Punctuation, Y4)

**Assessment**: The learning objectives are fully supplied by the graph — no invention needed. Each maps directly to a concept node with its statutory wording.

---

## 2. Success Criteria ✅

**Data source**: ContentVehicle EN-Y4-CV001 `success_criteria` property + concept teaching guidance.

Pupils can:
- [ ] Identify at least 3 different subordinating conjunctions in *The Iron Man* (although, while, because, when, if, until)
- [ ] Write at least 2 multi-clause sentences using different conjunctions to create varied effects
- [ ] Use a fronted adverbial to open a sentence and follow it with a comma
- [ ] Write a line of direct speech with: inverted commas, comma after the reporting clause, end punctuation inside the speech marks
- [ ] Explain the **pattern**: "What is the punctuation rule here? Does it always work this way?"

**Assessment**: The vehicle supplies 4 success criteria. I've expanded these into more specific, assessable statements using the concept teaching guidance. The thinking lens (Patterns) shaped the final criterion — the graph's question stems helped here.

---

## 3. Prior Knowledge Required ✅

**Data source**: PREREQUISITE_OF relationships (all 4 concepts have Y3 prerequisites) + cluster prerequisite section.

Pupils should already be able to:

| Y3 Prerequisite | Y4 Extension | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Multi-clause sentences with conjunctions (EN-Y3-C054) | Wider range: although, while, until, since | PREREQUISITE_OF |
| Conjunctions, adverbs and prepositions for time and cause (EN-Y3-C057) | Purpose conjunctions (so that, in order to); concessive (although, even though) | PREREQUISITE_OF |
| Fronted adverbials (EN-Y3-C058) | Extended range: time, place, manner, frequency adverbials | PREREQUISITE_OF |
| Direct speech punctuation (EN-Y3-C059) | More complex patterns: speech before/after/interrupted by reporting clause | PREREQUISITE_OF |

**Quick prior-knowledge check** (2 minutes at lesson start):
- "Write one sentence with a subordinating conjunction on your whiteboard."
- "Add a fronted adverbial to the start — don't forget the comma!"

**Assessment**: All four prerequisite links are explicit in the graph. The progression from Y3→Y4 is clearly traceable. The teaching guidance for each Y4 concept explains what's new compared to Y3 — this is genuinely useful for gauging what children already know versus what's being introduced.

---

## 4. Lesson Structure with Timings ⚠️

**Data source**: Learner profile (session sequence, scaffolding level) + pedagogy profile. Timings are teacher-invented — the graph provides structure but not minute-by-minute breakdowns.

**Note**: The learner profile suggests 15–25 minute sessions for the adaptive platform. This is a classroom lesson (60 minutes), so I'm adapting the pedagogical sequence to whole-class teaching. The five-phase sequence (challenge_problem → exploration → instruction → independent_practice → retrieval_practice) translates well to a talk-for-writing approach.

### Introduction (10 minutes)

**Phase 1: Challenge Problem** *(from pedagogy profile: "challenge problem first, no instruction")*

1. **Text encounter** (5 min): Display this passage from *The Iron Man* on the board:

   > *Although the farmers were terrified, they knew they had to act. Silently, the Iron Man strode across the field. "We must stop him!" cried the oldest farmer, while the others hid behind the barn.*

   *[Teacher note: I wrote this passage in the style of Ted Hughes — the graph doesn't provide actual text extracts. See Gap Analysis.]*

2. **Pattern hunt** (5 min): "With your talk partner, find as many sentence patterns as you can in this passage. How are the sentences built? What punctuation patterns do you notice?"
   - Thinking Lens prompt: *"What patterns can you see? Does this always happen, or can you find an exception?"*
   - Collect responses on the board. Don't correct yet — productive failure is appropriate at Y4 (learner profile).

### Main Activity (35 minutes)

**Phase 2: Exploration** *(from pedagogy profile: "guided exploration... Socratic questioning")*

3. **Shared analysis** (10 min): Work through the passage together, colour-coding:
   - **Blue** = subordinating conjunctions (although, while)
   - **Green** = fronted adverbials (Silently,)
   - **Red** = direct speech punctuation (inverted commas, comma, reporting verb)

   Use Socratic questioning: "What do you notice about where the comma goes? What does that tell you about the rule? Why do you think that?"

4. **Grammar rules as patterns** (5 min): Co-construct the rules with children:
   - **Conjunction pattern**: subordinating conjunction + clause, main clause (or reversed)
   - **Fronted adverbial pattern**: Adverbial phrase + comma + rest of sentence
   - **Direct speech pattern**: "Speech." + reporting clause / Reporting clause, + "Speech."

   Thinking Lens: "What rule connects these examples? What would you predict for the next one?"

**Phase 3: Instruction — Modelled and Shared Writing** *(from pedagogy profile: "worked example")*

5. **Teacher models** (10 min): Write 4-5 sentences on the board, thinking aloud:
   - "I want to start with a fronted adverbial to build tension... *Beyond the dark forest,* — comma! — *the Iron Man waited.*"
   - "Now I need some dialogue... *'Run!' screamed Hogarth,* — notice the comma comes before the closing speech mark — *while the metal giant rose to its full height.*"
   - Deliberately make one error for children to spot: forget a comma after a fronted adverbial. "Can anyone see my mistake?"

**Phase 4: Independent Practice** *(from pedagogy profile: "independent practice with interleaving")*

6. **Differentiated writing task** (10 min): Write a short passage (4-6 sentences) continuing *The Iron Man* story. Must include:
   - At least 1 fronted adverbial (comma after it!)
   - At least 1 multi-clause sentence with a subordinating conjunction other than "because" or "when"
   - At least 1 line of correctly punctuated direct speech

   *[Interleaving: the task requires applying all four concepts together, not practising each in isolation]*

### Plenary (15 minutes)

**Phase 5: Retrieval Practice** *(from pedagogy profile: "retrieval practice")*

7. **Peer review with talk partners** (5 min): Swap books. Use the success criteria checklist:
   - Can you find a fronted adverbial with a comma? Underline it in green.
   - Can you find a subordinating conjunction? Underline it in blue.
   - Can you find correctly punctuated speech? Underline it in red.
   - Is there anything you're not sure about? Put a ? next to it.

8. **Showcase and correct** (5 min): Select 2-3 children to read their best sentence aloud. Class identifies which grammar pattern they used. Address any common errors.

9. **Retrieval exit ticket** (5 min): On whiteboards:
   - "Write one sentence that uses a fronted adverbial AND direct speech."
   - Example target: *Nervously, the farmer whispered, "I think it's coming back."*

**Assessment**: The five-phase pedagogy sequence (challenge → exploration → instruction → independent → retrieval) is directly from the learner profile and works well for grammar-in-context teaching. Timings are my own professional judgement — the graph doesn't specify classroom timings (nor should it — it's designed for adaptive platform sessions).

## 5. Key Vocabulary with Definitions ✅

**Data source**: Concept `key_vocabulary` properties + ContentVehicle `definitions` property.

| Term | Definition | Source |
|---|---|---|
| clause | A group of words containing a verb that makes sense as part of a sentence | EN-Y4-C052 vocabulary |
| multi-clause sentence | A sentence with more than one clause, joined by a conjunction | EN-Y4-C052 vocabulary |
| subordinating conjunction | A word that joins a subordinate clause to a main clause (although, while, because, when, if, until, since) | EN-Y4-C052 vocabulary |
| co-ordinating conjunction | A word that joins two equal clauses (and, but, or, so, yet) | EN-Y4-C052 vocabulary |
| fronted adverbial | A word or phrase at the start of a sentence that tells you when, where or how something happened | EN-Y4-C056 vocabulary |
| inverted commas / speech marks | Punctuation marks placed around the exact words someone says | EN-Y4-C057 vocabulary |
| reporting clause | The part of a sentence that tells you who is speaking (e.g. said Tom, asked Mum) | EN-Y4-C057 vocabulary |
| dialogue | Conversation between characters in a story | EN-Y4-CV001 definitions |
| protagonist | The main character in a story | EN-Y4-CV001 definitions |
| suspense | A feeling of excitement or anxiety about what will happen next | EN-Y4-CV001 definitions |

**Assessment**: 27 vocabulary terms across the 4 concepts + 8 definitions from the vehicle. This is genuinely rich — more than enough for a single lesson. I've selected 10 that are essential for this lesson. The graph provides vocabulary at concept level, which is exactly what a teacher needs.

---

## 6. Resources and Materials Needed ⚠️

**Data source**: ContentVehicle `suggested_texts` property + `text_features` + `genre`. Materials list is teacher-invented.

### From the graph:
- **Core text**: *The Iron Man* by Ted Hughes (EN-Y4-CV001 `suggested_texts`)
- **Extension text**: *Stig of the Dump* by Clive King (EN-Y4-CV001 `suggested_texts`)
- **Genre**: Adventure narrative (EN-Y4-CV001 `genre`)
- **Text features to look for**: problem-resolution structure, vivid description, dialogue to advance plot, building suspense (EN-Y4-CV001 `text_features`)
- **Grammar focus**: fronted adverbials, expanded noun phrases, direct speech punctuation (EN-Y4-CV001 `grammar_focus`)

### Teacher-supplied (not in graph):
- Enlarged text extract displayed on IWB (I need to select/create an appropriate passage — the graph doesn't supply text extracts)
- Colour-coding pens/highlighters (blue, green, red)
- Individual whiteboards and pens
- Writing books/paper
- Grammar toolkit display: conjunction list, fronted adverbial examples, speech punctuation rules
- Differentiation writing frames (see section 7)

**Assessment**: The vehicle gives me a named text, reading level, genre, text features, and grammar focus — that's a strong starting point. But I need to find or create the actual text extracts myself. For English teaching, the passage selection is critical — you can't just say "use The Iron Man" without identifying which chapters or paragraphs best demonstrate the grammar patterns.

---

## 7. Differentiation (Support + Extension) ⚠️

**Data source**: Learner profile (scaffolding: moderate, hint tiers: max 3) + concept `common_misconceptions`. Differentiation strategies are teacher-designed using graph signals.

### Support (working towards expected)
- **Scaffold 1** (Tier 1 hint): Provide a sentence frame:
  *"_________ [fronted adverbial], the Iron Man _________ [verb]."*
  *"_________ [conjunction] the _________ , _________."*
- **Scaffold 2** (Tier 2 hint): Conjunction word bank displayed: *although, while, until, since, because, when, if*
- **Scaffold 3** (Tier 3 hint): Direct speech punctuation checklist:
  1. Open speech marks "
  2. Capital letter for first word of speech
  3. Punctuation INSIDE the closing speech marks
  4. Comma before closing speech marks if reporting clause follows
  5. Close speech marks "

- **Target common misconception** (EN-Y4-C056): "Watch for children forgetting the comma after a fronted adverbial — this is the most common error."
- **Target common misconception** (EN-Y4-C057): "Children frequently misplace speech marks, particularly forgetting to close them."

### Extension (greater depth)
- Write a passage using all four grammar patterns in a single paragraph
- Use the **interrupted speech** pattern: *"Hello," said Tom, "how are you?"* (identified as "particularly challenging" in EN-Y4-C057 misconceptions)
- Vary reporting verbs beyond "said": whispered, exclaimed, muttered, announced (from EN-Y4-C057 teaching guidance)
- Apply the **Structure and Function** thinking lens (rank 2): "Why does the writer use a fronted adverbial here? What effect does it have on the reader?"

**Assessment**: The graph provides strong data for differentiation design: the 3-tier hint system from the learner profile, common misconceptions for each concept (invaluable for targeting support), and the teaching guidance identifies specific progression points (e.g. interrupted speech as an extension challenge). I invented the actual scaffold formats (sentence frames, word banks, checklists), but the content within them is graph-sourced.

## 8. Assessment Opportunities ⚠️

**Data source**: ContentVehicle `assessment_guidance` + `success_criteria` + concept `common_misconceptions`. Assessment methods are teacher-designed.

### Formative Assessment (during lesson)
| Checkpoint | Method | What to look for | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prior knowledge check | Whiteboard sentences | Can children write a multi-clause sentence from Y3? | Prerequisite links |
| Pattern hunt | Talk partner discussion | Do children spot conjunctions, adverbials, speech marks? | Pedagogy: challenge_problem |
| Shared analysis | Colour-coding | Can children identify the three grammar patterns? | Concept teaching guidance |
| Independent writing | Circulate and check | Are all four patterns present and correctly punctuated? | Success criteria (vehicle) |
| Peer review | Partner checklist | Can children identify patterns in each other's work? | Pedagogy: retrieval_practice |
| Exit ticket | Whiteboard sentence | Can children combine fronted adverbial + direct speech? | Vehicle assessment_guidance |

### Vehicle Assessment Guidance (from graph):
> "Can pupils identify the problem-resolution structure in The Iron Man? Can they make inferences about characters using evidence from the text? Can they write their own adventure narrative using fronted adverbials, expanded noun phrases, and correctly punctuated dialogue?"

### Summative indicator:
By end of unit, children should be able to meet the vehicle's **writing outcome**: "Write an adventure narrative (500-700 words) with clear problem-resolution structure, vivid description, and dialogue" — this is a multi-lesson goal, not achievable in a single 60-minute lesson.

**Assessment**: The graph provides assessment guidance at vehicle level and success criteria, plus rich misconceptions data. What's missing: no rubric, no marking criteria, no example marked work, no "what does expected/greater depth look like?" descriptors. For English, this matters — you need to see what a good piece of Y4 narrative writing looks like, not just what it should contain. The DifficultyLevel nodes (entry → developing → expected → greater_depth) exist for Y3 Maths but not yet for English — these would be transformative for English assessment.

## 9. Common Misconceptions to Address ✅

**Data source**: Concept `common_misconceptions` properties — all 4 concepts have explicit, detailed misconceptions.

| Concept | Misconception | How to address |
|---|---|---|
| Multi-clause sentences (C052) | Children write grammatically tangled sentences, losing track of the main clause | Model parsing: "Which is the main clause? Which is the subordinate clause? Does the sentence still make sense if you remove the subordinate clause?" |
| Multi-clause sentences (C052) | Over-reliance on "when" and "because" as default conjunctions | Display a conjunctions menu organised by function (time, cause, contrast, concession). Challenge: "Can you replace 'because' with 'since' or 'as'?" |
| Conjunctions for time/cause (C055) | Overuse of time connectives ("then... then... then...") without using causal or contrastive connectives | Explicitly teach the four functions: time, cause, contrast, purpose. Use colour-coded connectives display. |
| Fronted adverbials (C056) | Forgetting the comma after a fronted adverbial | Make it physical: clap after reading the adverbial aloud — "that clap is your comma!" |
| Fronted adverbials (C056) | Starting every sentence with a fronted adverbial (overuse) | Model sentence variety: "Read your paragraph back. How many sentences start with a fronted adverbial? If it's more than 2 in 5, you've overdone it." |
| Direct speech (C057) | Misplacing speech marks — forgetting to close them, or placing them around the reporting clause too | Use "speech sandwich" analogy: the speech marks are the bread, the speech is the filling, the reporting clause is the label on the outside |
| Direct speech (C057) | Not placing comma before closing speech mark | Show the rule visually: the comma always goes INSIDE the speech marks, like it's part of the speech |

**Assessment**: This is one of the graph's strongest areas for English. Every concept has 3-4 specific, well-written misconceptions drawn from real classroom experience. For a teacher, this is gold — it tells me exactly what to watch for and allows me to prepare targeted interventions. The misconceptions data is genuinely more useful than some published schemes of work.

## 10. Worked Examples / Model Texts ❌

**Data source**: None in the graph. The vehicle names texts (*The Iron Man*, *Stig of the Dump*) and identifies text features, but provides no actual text extracts, model sentences, or teacher writing samples.

### What I created (not from graph):

**Model passage** (teacher-written, in the style of Ted Hughes):

> *Beyond the scrapyard fence, the Iron Man stood completely still. Although the birds had stopped singing, Hogarth crept closer. He knew he had to be brave.*
>
> *"Don't be afraid," whispered his father, while the metal giant turned its enormous head.*
>
> *Suddenly, two headlamp eyes blazed in the darkness. Because he had seen them before, Hogarth did not run. Instead, he raised one hand slowly.*
>
> *"I know you won't hurt me," said Hogarth quietly, "because you are not what they think you are."*

**Grammar patterns in this extract:**
- Fronted adverbials: *Beyond the scrapyard fence,* / *Suddenly,*
- Subordinating conjunctions: *Although* / *Because* / *while*
- Direct speech (three patterns): speech-first (*"Don't be afraid," whispered his father*), speech-after (*said Hogarth quietly*), interrupted (*"I know you won't hurt me," said Hogarth quietly, "because you are not what they think you are."*)

**Assessment**: This is the single biggest gap for English teaching. The graph tells me *which text* to use (The Iron Man), *what features* to look for (problem-resolution, vivid description, dialogue, suspense), and *which grammar* to teach through it (fronted adverbials, expanded noun phrases, direct speech). But it doesn't give me a single line of actual text or a model writing sample. For Maths, a "worked example" is a calculation you can generate. For English, a worked example IS the model text — and creating good model texts is the most time-consuming part of English planning. This is the area where the graph most needs enrichment for English/literacy.

## 11. Practice Activities / Writing Tasks ⚠️

**Data source**: Vehicle `writing_outcome` + concept `teaching_guidance` + learner profile interaction types. Activity design is teacher-created.

### Activity 1: Pattern Hunt (exploration)
**Interaction type**: Text Highlight and Select *(from learner profile — primary)*
- Display a passage from *The Iron Man*
- Children highlight: conjunctions (blue), fronted adverbials (green), speech punctuation (red)
- *"Find the part of the text that shows you a fronted adverbial. Why does that part of the text use a comma there?"*

### Activity 2: Sentence Surgery (guided practice)
**Interaction type**: Drag to Reorder *(from learner profile — primary)*
- Provide jumbled sentence components. Children reorder to make correct multi-clause sentences and correctly punctuated speech.
- 4–6 items (Y4 recommendation from learner profile)
- Example: [ , ] [ " ] [ said Hogarth ] [ the Iron Man ] [ Although ] [ was enormous ] [ I'm not scared ] [ " ]

### Activity 3: Adventure Narrative Writing (independent practice)
**Interaction type**: Text Input *(adapted from learner profile)*
- Write 4-6 sentences continuing *The Iron Man* story
- Must include all four grammar patterns (interleaving — from pedagogy profile)
- Writing outcome from vehicle: "Write an adventure narrative (500-700 words)" — scaled down to 4-6 sentences for a single lesson

### Activity 4: Pattern Swap (retrieval / peer assessment)
**Interaction type**: Matching Pairs *(from learner profile — primary)*
- Match grammar terms to examples from each other's writing
- 4-5 pairs (Y4 recommendation from learner profile)
- Pairs: conjunction↔example, fronted adverbial↔example, speech marks↔example, reporting clause↔example

**Assessment**: The learner profile's interaction types are helpful for platform-based activities but need significant adaptation for classroom teaching. Text Highlight works on paper too; Drag to Reorder needs physical sentence cards; Matching Pairs works as a table-top activity. The vehicle's writing outcome (500-700 word narrative) gives a clear end goal, but it's a unit-level outcome, not a single lesson one. I had to design the specific activities myself.

---

## 12. Cross-Curricular Links ⚠️

**Data source**: CO_TEACHES relationships + ContentVehicle `DELIVERS` links + vehicle descriptions. Cross-curricular connections are partially graph-sourced.

### From CO_TEACHES relationships:
The grammar concepts in this cluster co-teach with:
- **EN-Y4-C045** — Paragraphing in composition *(cross-domain: D006 Writing Composition)*
- **EN-Y4-C054** — Pronoun choice for cohesion *(same domain: D007, next cluster)*
- **EN-Y4-C058** — Expanded noun phrases *(same domain: D007, cluster 3)*
- **EN-Y4-C061** — Paragraphs to organise ideas around a theme
- **EN-Y4-C062** — Year 4 grammatical terminology
- **EN-Y4-C063** — Figurative language and academic vocabulary

### Reading ↔ Writing connection (from vehicle DELIVERS):
EN-Y4-CV001 delivers both:
- Reading concepts (C026 inference, C027 prediction)
- Writing concepts (C046 narrative elements)
- Grammar is taught through the reading text — the classic English teaching cycle of read → analyse → write

### Wider cross-curricular (teacher-identified, not graph-sourced):
- **History** (Y4): Using multi-clause sentences in historical writing — "Although the Romans built straight roads, the Celts preferred winding paths." *(Flagging this for Farah who is doing Y4 History)*
- **Science**: Report writing using fronted adverbials — "After heating the water, we observed..."
- **PSHE**: Persuasive speech and debate *(links to EN-Y4-CV003 and EN-Y4-CV008)*

**Assessment**: The CO_TEACHES relationships are genuinely useful — they show which grammar concepts naturally pair together, which helps with unit sequencing. The vehicle's cross-domain DELIVERS (reading + writing + grammar concepts) maps the read→write cycle well. However, there are no cross-subject links in the graph for English. The only DEVELOPS_SKILL relationships are for Science, Geography, and History concepts, not English ones. English-specific skill nodes (e.g., ReadingSkill) exist but aren't linked at concept level.
