## Headline Finding

> The graph tells teachers **what to teach** and **why** — but not **how** or **with what**.

The system provides strong *curriculum intelligence* (concept structure, prerequisites, misconceptions, thinking lenses, sequencing) but weak *resource intelligence* (no model texts, no worked examples, no maps, no source materials, no printable artefacts).

Between "lesson plan" and "what I hand to 30 children at 9am" sits an entire production layer that doesn't yet exist. **Production work is 3–4× planning work** (Sharma).

## The DifficultyLevel Verdict

The single clearest signal from this review: **DifficultyLevels are the most impactful data addition in the graph's history**.

| Metric | Y3 Maths (HAS DL) | Y5 Maths (NO DL) | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| Overall readiness | 7.5/10 | 6.0/10 | **+1.5** |
| Differentiation rating | ✅ Sufficient | ⚠️ Partial | **Transformed** |
| Worked examples rating | ✅ Sufficient | ❌ Missing | **Transformed** |
| Practice questions | ✅ Sufficient | ⚠️ Partial | **Significant** |
| Artefact generation viability | 4 of 5 populatable | 2 of 5 populatable | **Doubled** |

Brennan (Y3 Maths): *"In 8 years of teaching, I have never had differentiation data this specific handed to me at planning time. I did not have to invent a single differentiated task."*

Sharma (Y5 Maths): *"DifficultyLevel rollout is prerequisite to high-quality artefact generation."*

**Every single teacher** requested DifficultyLevels for their subject. This is 9/9 consensus — the strongest signal in any review round.

## What the Graph Does Well (Consensus Strengths)

### 1. Misconceptions — universally praised (9/9 teachers)
Rated ✅ by every teacher regardless of subject. Specific, per-concept, clearly practitioner-authored. Multiple teachers called this "the best I've seen in any planning resource."

### 2. Curriculum structure — prerequisites, sequencing, domains (9/9)
The prerequisite chains, cluster sequencing, and domain organisation were consistently rated ✅. Teachers could immediately identify what pupils need before a lesson and where the lesson sits in the progression.

### 3. Thinking lenses — pedagogically useful (8/9)
The lens + rationale + age-banded question stems were directly usable in lesson planning. "Patterns" for maths/spelling, "Cause and Effect" for science/history, "Systems" for geography — all appropriate choices with actionable prompts.

### 4. Learner profiles — well-calibrated (7/9)
The pedagogy sequence, feedback guidance, and content guidelines were praised as accurate for each year group. Two exceptions: interaction types are subject-agnostic (Patel found fraction_visualizer in her English profile), and KS2 Science content lacks year-group differentiation (Chen found Y3 and Y6 content indistinguishable).

### 5. Key vocabulary — comprehensive (8/9)
Term lists were rated ✅ or ⚠️ across all subjects. The gap is child-friendly definitions (the terms exist but definitions are teacher-facing).

## What the Graph Lacks (Consensus Gaps)

### Gap 1: Worked Examples / Model Content (9/9 — unanimous)
Every teacher flagged this. The form varies by subject:
- **Maths**: Step-by-step calculations with method annotation
- **Science**: Model scientific diagrams, labelled experiment setups
- **English**: Model texts, annotated passages, grammar exemplar sentences
- **History**: Model historical arguments, annotated source analyses
- **Geography**: Model geographical analyses, annotated map interpretations

### Gap 2: DifficultyLevels Beyond Y3 Maths (9/9 — unanimous)
Only Y3 Maths has them. Every other subject/year requires teachers to invent their own differentiation tiers. This is the #1 data addition requested.

### Gap 3: Content Vehicles Coverage Is Patchy
| Subject | KS2 Vehicles | Status |
|---|---|---|
| History | 6 topic studies | Decent coverage |
| Science | 8 investigations | Good for Y5, but year-agnostic |
| English | 8 text studies | Y4 only — **Y3 has zero** |
| Mathematics | 7 worked example sets | Reasonable |
| Geography | **0** | **Complete gap** |

Geography scoring 4.0/10 (lowest) is directly attributable to zero content vehicles.

### Gap 4: Cross-Subject Links Are Missing
- No English↔History concept links (despite writing in history being standard practice)
- No Science↔Maths data handling links (despite every science investigation requiring maths)
- No Geography↔Science links (climate, water cycle, habitats span both subjects)
- Spelling↔Grammar cross-domain CO_TEACHES missing within English (Patel)

### Gap 5: Practice Questions Don't Exist
Zero questions in the graph. The misconceptions provide excellent distractor material, and the DifficultyLevels (where they exist) provide graded task descriptions — but no actual ready-to-use questions.

### Gap 6: Data Quality Issues Found
- **Missing KS1→Y3 prerequisite links** for English spelling (Patel) — direct conceptual dependencies not modelled
- **Interaction types are subject-agnostic** — maths manipulatives appear in English profiles (Patel)
- **KS2 Science lacks year-group tags** — Y3 and Y6 content indistinguishable to an AI agent (Chen)
- **Geography has zero content vehicles** (Obi, Adebayo)
- **Y3 English has zero content vehicles** while Y4 has 8 (Patel)

## Teaching Artefacts: What Teachers Actually Need

### Cross-Subject Priority Ranking

Compiled from all 9 teachers' top-5 lists:

| Rank | Artefact | Mentioned By | Can Generate Today? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Differentiated practice worksheets** | 9/9 | Partially — needs DifficultyLevels |
| 2 | **Knowledge organisers** | 7/9 | **Yes** — graph has ~70% of content |
| 3 | **Vocabulary/word mats** | 7/9 | **Yes** — terms exist, needs formatting |
| 4 | **Assessment rubrics / exit tickets** | 6/9 | Partially — needs DifficultyLevels |
| 5 | **Worked example displays** | 5/9 | No — needs model content data |

### Subject-Specific Artefacts

| Subject | Unique Artefact Need | Graph Support |
|---|---|---|
| **Maths** | Manipulative templates (fraction strips, number grids, place value cards) | High — denominators/numbers in graph |
| **Science** | Investigation recording scaffolds + safety cards | Medium — variables/format exist, safety is skeletal |
| **English** | Model text displays + sentence surgery cards + writing frames | Low — text titles exist, no actual content |
| **History** | Source packs (primary/secondary source extracts) | Very low — sources named, no extracts |
| **Geography** | Map worksheets + data cards + fieldwork recording sheets | Very low — zero vehicles, no map/data resources |

### What Teachers DON'T Need Generated
- **Videos/animations** — not prioritised by any teacher ("teacher modelling beats video")
- **Images** — mentioned by none as top-5
- **PowerPoint slides** — actively rejected by Maths teachers ("mastery uses live board work, not slides"), wanted by English/Science for IWB display

### The Generation Readiness Ladder

Based on current graph data + proposed DifficultyLevel rollout:

| Artefact | Generatable Now | With DL Rollout | With Full Additions |
|---|---|---|---|
| Knowledge organiser | 70% content | 85% content | 95% content |
| Vocabulary word mat | 80% content | 80% content | 95% content |
| Exit ticket (3 questions) | 30% content | **90% content** | 95% content |
| Differentiated worksheets | 20% content | **70% content** | 90% content |
| Assessment rubric | 20% content | **80% content** | 95% content |
| Worked example display | 10% content | 40% content | 80% content |
| Subject-specific resources | 5% content | 20% content | 60% content |

**Key insight**: DifficultyLevel rollout is the single highest-leverage investment. It unlocks exit tickets, differentiated worksheets, and assessment rubrics — the three artefacts that consume the most teacher time.

## Recommended Priority Actions

### Tier 1: Quick Wins (data corrections, high impact)
1. **Fix KS1→Y3 English prerequisite links** — 6 missing PREREQUISITE_OF relationships (Patel)
2. **Fix subject-agnostic interaction types** — filter by subject, not just year (Patel)
3. **Add year-group tags to KS2 Science** — Y3 and Y6 currently indistinguishable (Chen)

### Tier 2: DifficultyLevel Rollout (highest leverage)
4. **Extend DL to Y4 + Y5 Mathematics** — direct comparison data exists from this review
5. **Extend DL to Y3 + Y4 English** — grammar concepts are ideal candidates (Kowalski showed exact schema)
6. **Extend DL to Y5 Science** — investigation concepts map well to entry→greater_depth
7. **Extend DL to KS2 History + Geography** — both teachers independently designed DL schemas

### Tier 3: Content Vehicle Gaps
8. **Create Geography content vehicles** — zero exist, scored 4.0/10 (Obi)
9. **Create Y3 English content vehicles** — Y4 has 8, Y3 has zero (Patel)
10. **Add year-group specificity to KS2 Science vehicles** — currently KS-wide (Chen)

### Tier 4: Resource Intelligence Layer
11. **Practice question bank** — 5-10 per cluster, tagged by type + difficulty
12. **Model sentences on English grammar concepts** — 3-5 per concept
13. **Cross-curricular relationship type** — explicit subject-spanning links
14. **Structured safety data on Science vehicles** — replace free-text with hazard/precaution/severity

### Tier 5: Artefact Generation Infrastructure
15. **Knowledge organiser generator** — lowest-hanging fruit, 70% content already in graph
16. **Vocabulary word mat generator** — 80% content exists, needs formatting layer
17. **Exit ticket generator** — trivial with DifficultyLevels, 3 questions per cluster

## Score Comparison with Previous Reviews

| Review | Average Score | What Changed |
|---|---|---|
| V4 (pre-vehicles) | 3.7/10 | Bare curriculum structure only |
| V5 (+ vehicles + lenses) | 6.6/10 | Content vehicles + thinking lenses added |
| **V7 (+ DL pilot)** | **5.7/10** | Broader sample (Geography dragged average down) |
| V7 Maths with DL | **7.5/10** | DifficultyLevels = +1.5 over same subject without |
| V7 excluding Geography | **6.1/10** | Comparable to V5 across subjects with vehicles |

The V7 average is lower than V5 because this review deliberately sampled underserved subjects (Geography = 0 vehicles). The like-for-like comparison (subjects with content vehicles) shows comparable or slightly better scores, with the DifficultyLevel pilot adding a clear +1.5 uplift.

**Projected scores with full DL rollout + vehicle gaps filled:**
- Maths: 7.5 → 8.5 (add practice questions)
- Science: 6.0 → 7.5 (add DL + year tags + safety data)
- English: 5.75 → 7.0 (add DL + Y3 vehicles + model sentences)
- History: 5.5 → 7.0 (add DL + source materials)
- Geography: 4.5 → 6.5 (add vehicles + DL + map resources)

**Path to 9/10**: DifficultyLevels everywhere + practice question bank + subject-specific resource nodes (TextResource, SourceMaterial, RecordingTemplate) + artefact generation layer.
