# Lesson Plan: Why Did the Romans Invade Britain — and Does It Still Matter?

**Teacher**: Ms. Farah (Y4, 9 years experience, London primary)
**Cluster**: `HI-KS2-D004-CL001` — Analyse causes, consequences and the significance of historical events (introduction)
**Content Vehicle**: `HI-KS2-CV002` — Roman Britain (topic_study)
**Thinking Lens**: Cause and Effect (primary) + Evidence and Argument (secondary)
**Date**: 2026-02-23

---

## 1. Learning Objectives ✅

**Substantive (content) objectives — from graph:**
- Identify multiple causes for the Roman invasion of Britain in 43 AD
- Explain at least two consequences of Roman occupation (short-term and long-term)
- Begin to evaluate the significance of the Roman legacy in modern Britain

**Disciplinary (historical thinking) objectives — from graph:**
- Develop causal reasoning: categorise causes (political, economic, military) and distinguish between them (HI-KS2-C001: Cause and Consequence → links to `Causation and consequence` historical thinking skill)
- Use evidence from a primary source (Vindolanda tablet) to support a historical claim (HI-KS2-C003 → links to `Historical evidence` historical thinking skill)
- Begin to apply criteria for historical significance (HI-KS2-C002: Significance → links to `Historical significance` historical thinking skill)

**Enquiry question**: *Why did the Romans invade Britain, and does the Roman legacy still matter today?*

> **Data source**: Objectives from HI-KS2-O010, O011, O012. Concepts from cluster: HI-KS2-C001 (Cause and Consequence) and HI-KS2-C002 (Significance). Historical thinking skills from DEVELOPS_SKILL relationships. Content vehicle success criteria.

---

## 2. Success Criteria ⚠️

**All pupils will:**
- Name at least two reasons why the Romans invaded Britain
- Sequence the Roman invasion (43 AD), Boudicca's revolt (60-61 AD), Hadrian's Wall (122 AD), and withdrawal (c.410 AD) chronologically
- Use a primary source to make one evidence-based inference

**Most pupils will:**
- Categorise causes into types (e.g. wanting resources vs. wanting power)
- Explain at least one short-term and one long-term consequence of Roman occupation
- Use the sentence structure: "The Romans invaded because... This led to... which was significant because..."

**Some pupils will:**
- Evaluate which cause was most important and justify their choice with evidence
- Assess whether the Roman legacy is still significant today, using explicit criteria (notable, remembered, resulting)
- Recognise that significance can be judged differently depending on perspective (Roman coloniser vs. Briton)

> **Data source**: Partially from graph — content vehicle `success_criteria` gave 4 criteria. I expanded and differentiated these into three tiers. The differentiated tiers were **invented by me** — the graph has no difficulty levels for History concepts (only piloted for Y3 Maths).

---

## 3. Prior Knowledge Required ✅

**From KS1 History (graph prerequisite data):**
- **Time and Chronology** (HI-KS1-C001) — prerequisite of → HI-KS2-C001 (Cause and Consequence). Pupils should already be able to sequence events on a timeline and use vocabulary like "before", "after", "a long time ago"
- **Change and Continuity** (HI-KS1-C002) — prerequisite of → HI-KS2-C002 (Significance). Pupils should recognise that things change over time and some things stay the same
- **Historical Sources and Evidence** (HI-KS1-C004) — prerequisite of → HI-KS2-C002, HI-KS2-C003. Pupils should have used simple sources (photographs, objects) to find out about the past

**Within KS2 (assumed from curriculum sequence):**
- Pupils should have studied Stone Age to Iron Age Britain (HI-KS2-CV001) before Roman Britain, giving them a chronological framework for pre-Roman life

> **Data source**: Prerequisite relationships from graph (HI-KS1 → HI-KS2). The within-KS2 sequencing assumption is mine — the graph has no explicit teaching order between content vehicles.

## 4. Lesson Structure with Timings ⚠️

### Introduction — 10 minutes: The Challenge Problem

*Following the Y4 pedagogy profile: productive failure sequence starts with a challenge problem before instruction.*

**0-3 min: Hook — "What would make you leave home?"**
Show pupils a map of the Roman Empire at its peak. Ask: *"The Romans lived in a city called Rome, surrounded by beautiful countryside and warm weather. Why would they travel hundreds of miles across the sea to cold, rainy Britain?"*

Pupils discuss in pairs for 60 seconds (think-pair-share).

**3-7 min: Source encounter — Vindolanda tablet**
Display an image of a Vindolanda writing tablet (from British Museum digital collection). Read aloud a simplified extract — a Roman soldier writing home about the cold weather and asking for warm socks.

Socratic questioning sequence (from Y4 learner profile — `inference_task`):
1. "What do you notice about this object?"
2. "What does that tell you about the person who wrote it?"
3. "Why do you think a Roman soldier was in Britain writing about socks?"
4. "What would need to be different for this letter not to exist?"

Do NOT confirm or deny answers yet. Collect ideas on the board.

**7-10 min: Framing the enquiry**
Reveal the enquiry question: *"Why did the Romans invade Britain, and does the Roman legacy still matter today?"*
Explain: "Today we are going to think like historians. Historians don't just learn what happened — they ask WHY it happened, and whether it still matters."

> **Data source**: Pedagogy profile (productive failure sequence, Socratic questioning, session_sequence: challenge_problem → exploration). Source: Vindolanda tablets listed in content vehicle `sources`. Interaction type: `inference_task` from Y4 primary interactions. Hook and framing **invented by me** — graph has no starter activities.

### Main Activity — 35 minutes: Exploration and Instruction

**10-20 min: Cause sorting activity (exploration phase)**

Provide pupils with 8 cause cards (pre-prepared). Each card states one reason historians believe the Romans invaded:

| Card | Cause | Category |
|------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Britain had tin, gold, and iron the Romans wanted | Economic |
| 2 | Emperor Claudius needed a military victory to prove he was a strong leader | Political |
| 3 | Julius Caesar had tried to invade before (55-54 BC) and the job was unfinished | Military |
| 4 | Some British tribes had been helping Rome's enemies in Gaul | Military |
| 5 | Britain had good farmland and grain | Economic |
| 6 | Roman soldiers wanted land as a reward for fighting | Economic |
| 7 | Conquering a distant island would make the Empire look powerful | Political |
| 8 | Roman traders already knew about Britain and its wealth | Economic |

**Task**: Using `drag_categorise` interaction type — pupils sort the 8 cards into categories: "Wanting resources" / "Wanting power" / "Military reasons". Some cards could go in more than one pile — that is deliberate.

**Discussion**: "Is there just ONE reason the Romans invaded? What does it tell us that there are so many reasons?" Introduce the vocabulary: **cause**, **factor**, **multiple causes**.

**20-30 min: Consequence mapping (instruction phase)**

Teacher-led instruction: explain the difference between **short-term consequences** (what happened straight away) and **long-term consequences** (what we still see today).

**Matching pairs activity** (`matching_pairs`, 5 pairs for Y4):

| Consequence | Type |
|-------------|------|
| Boudicca led a revolt against Roman rule | Short-term |
| Romans built roads that we still use today | Long-term |
| Roman soldiers built Hadrian's Wall to mark the northern border | Short-term |
| Many English words come from Latin, the Roman language | Long-term |
| The Romans built towns with baths, temples, and amphitheatres | Both — short-term action, long-term legacy |

After matching, display all correct pairs. Misconception correction: "A common idea is that the Romans just conquered and left. But actually, they stayed for nearly 400 years — longer than the time between now and the reign of Elizabeth I."

**30-40 min: Significance evaluation (independent practice)**

Introduce 3 significance criteria (from concept HI-KS2-C002 teaching guidance):
- **Remembered** — Is it still remembered today?
- **Resulting** — Did it have consequences that lasted?
- **Remarkable** — Was it unusual for its time?

Pupils choose ONE aspect of the Roman legacy (roads, language, towns, law) and complete a writing frame:

> "I think _________ is / is not significant because...
> It is remembered because...
> It resulted in...
> It was / was not remarkable because..."

(`text_input_phrase` interaction — accept key terms and partial explanations, provide sentence starters)

**40-45 min: Perspective shift**

Brief discussion using the content vehicle's `perspectives` data: "Would a Roman coloniser and a Briton like Boudicca agree about whether the Roman invasion was a good thing? Why might they see it differently?"

This addresses the misconception (from HI-KS2-C002) that significance is a fixed fact rather than a judgement.

> **Data source**: Key events, key figures, definitions, perspectives all from content vehicle HI-KS2-CV002. Concept teaching guidance and misconceptions from HI-KS2-C001 and C002. Interaction types (`drag_categorise`, `matching_pairs`, `text_input_phrase`) from Y4 learner profile. The 8 cause cards, consequence pairings, and writing frame were **invented by me** — the graph has no ready-made activities, worksheets, or source extracts.

### Plenary — 15 minutes: Retrieval and Argument

**45-52 min: Chronological ordering** (`drag_reorder`, 5 items for Y4)

Pupils sequence:
1. Julius Caesar's raids on Britain (55-54 BC)
2. Roman invasion under Claudius (43 AD)
3. Boudicca's revolt (60-61 AD)
4. Building of Hadrian's Wall (122 AD)
5. Roman withdrawal from Britain (c.410 AD)

After incorrect submission, show correct order with brief explanation of the sequencing logic.

**52-57 min: Return to the enquiry question**

Multiple choice assessment (`multi_choice_4`):

*"Which of these is the BEST explanation for why the Romans invaded Britain?"*
- A) They wanted to steal all the gold (addresses single-cause misconception)
- B) There were many reasons — they wanted resources, power, and to finish what Caesar started (correct — multiple causes)
- C) They wanted to build roads (confuses consequence with cause)
- D) Emperor Claudius liked travelling (trivialises political motivation)

Feedback (elaborated_competence style): "B is the strongest answer. You've learned today that historians rarely find just one cause for a big event. The Roman invasion happened because of several factors working together: economic (resources), political (Claudius needed prestige), and military (unfinished business from Caesar). That is sophisticated historical thinking."

**57-60 min: Exit reflection**

"Tell your partner one thing the Romans left behind that we still use today. If you can explain WHY it lasted, even better."

> **Data source**: Key events from content vehicle (chronological data). Interaction types from Y4 profile. Feedback style from Y4 feedback profile (elaborated_competence, respectful_and_precise). Assessment question and feedback **invented by me** — graph has no pre-written assessment items.

## 5. Key Vocabulary with Definitions ✅

**From content vehicle `definitions`:**
- **centurion** — a Roman army officer in charge of about 80 soldiers
- **legion** — a large unit of the Roman army, about 5,000 soldiers
- **Romanisation** — the process of conquered peoples adopting Roman customs, language, and buildings
- **villa** — a large Roman country house, often with underfloor heating and mosaics
- **amphitheatre** — a round or oval building where Romans watched gladiator fights and other entertainment
- **mosaic** — a picture or pattern made from small pieces of coloured stone or tile
- **aqueduct** — a bridge-like structure built to carry water over long distances
- **revolt** — when people fight back against those who rule them
- **empire** — a group of countries or peoples ruled by one powerful leader or government

**From concept key vocabulary (HI-KS2-C001 + C002):**
- **cause** — a reason why something happened
- **consequence** — what happened as a result of an event
- **factor** — one of several reasons that together explain why something happened
- **significance** — how important something is in history, judged by criteria like its lasting impact
- **evidence** — information that helps us work out what happened in the past
- **legacy** — something left behind by people in the past that still affects us today

> **Data source**: 9 definitions from content vehicle. 6 from concept `key_vocabulary` fields. Definitions simplified for Y4 by me — graph provides the terms but definitions are pitched at a general level, not age-banded.

---

## 6. Resources and Materials Needed ⚠️

**From graph (content vehicle):**
- Image/transcript of Vindolanda tablet (source: British Museum collection — URL provided)
- Map of Roman Empire (resource_types: `museum_collection`)
- Reference to Hadrian's Wall (English Heritage — URL provided)
- Source types listed: primary written, primary archaeological, built heritage

**Invented / sourced by teacher:**
- 8 cause cards (printed or digital) — teacher-made
- Matching pairs cards for consequences — teacher-made
- Significance writing frame — teacher-made
- Timeline display for the classroom
- Images of Roman roads, ruins at Bath, Latin-derived English words
- Simplified extract from Vindolanda tablet (the graph lists "Vindolanda tablets" as a source but provides no actual text or image)

> **Data source**: The content vehicle provides source names, URLs to museum collections, and source types. But it does NOT provide actual source extracts, images, simplified texts, or downloadable resources. Every physical/digital resource for the lesson must be created or sourced by the teacher. This is the single biggest gap for history lesson planning.

---

## 7. Differentiation (Support + Extension) ⚠️

**Support (working towards expected):**
- Reduce cause cards from 8 to 5 (remove cards 4, 6, 8)
- Provide word bank for the significance writing frame
- Pair with a more confident partner during discussion
- Offer sentence starters: "The Romans invaded because..." / "This was significant because..."
- Use the `multi_choice_3` interaction type (secondary) instead of `multi_choice_4` to reduce cognitive load

**Extension (working at greater depth):**
- Ask pupils to rank causes: "Which cause do you think was MOST important? Why?"
- Challenge: "Can you think of a consequence the Romans did NOT intend?" (introduces unintended consequences from C001 teaching guidance)
- Write a diary entry from two perspectives: a Roman general explaining why the invasion was a success, and a British leader explaining why it was a disaster
- Introduce the concept that significance changes over time: "Were the Romans more significant 1000 years ago or today?"

> **Data source**: Interaction types from Y4 profile (multi_choice_3 as secondary option). Concept teaching guidance mentions ranking causes and unintended consequences. The specific differentiated activities were **invented by me** — the graph has no difficulty levels for History and no differentiation scaffolds.

---

## 8. Assessment Opportunities ⚠️

**Formative (during lesson):**
- Cause sorting: Can pupils categorise causes? Do they recognise multiple causes? (observation)
- Matching pairs: Can pupils distinguish short-term from long-term consequences? (digital/physical activity)
- Significance writing frame: Can pupils apply criteria to evaluate significance? (written product)
- Chronological ordering: Can pupils sequence 5 events correctly? (digital activity)
- Exit reflection: Can pupils name a Roman legacy and explain why it lasted? (oral)

**Summative (from content vehicle `assessment_guidance`):**
> "Can pupils explain WHY the Romans invaded (multiple causes: trade, resources, prestige)? Can they use a primary source (e.g. Vindolanda tablet) to make inferences about Roman life? Can they assess the SIGNIFICANCE of the Roman legacy in modern Britain?"

**Against success criteria:**
- All pupils: name 2+ causes, sequence events, use a source ✓ (assessable via activities above)
- Most pupils: categorise causes, explain consequences, use significance frame ✓
- Some pupils: evaluate, compare perspectives, recognise contested significance ✓

> **Data source**: Assessment guidance from content vehicle (1 paragraph). Y4 feedback profile specifies elaborated_competence style. Specific formative assessment points were **invented by me** — the graph has no per-activity assessment rubrics, no marking criteria, and no exemplar pupil responses.

---

## 9. Common Misconceptions to Address ✅

**From HI-KS2-C001 (Cause and Consequence):**
- **Single-cause thinking**: Pupils identify one cause for the invasion when multiple factors interact. *Address by*: cause sorting activity explicitly provides 8 causes across 3 categories
- **Correlation vs. causation**: Pupils may confuse things happening at the same time with one causing the other. *Address by*: discussing whether trading with Britain caused the invasion or just made it possible
- **Unintended consequences are invisible**: Pupils may not realise that some consequences were not planned. *Address by*: asking "Did the Romans plan to change the English language?"

**From HI-KS2-C002 (Significance):**
- **Significance = fame**: Pupils think well-known = most significant. *Address by*: asking whether a famous Roman (Julius Caesar) was more significant than the unknown engineers who built the roads
- **Significance is fixed**: Pupils don't realise it can be contested. *Address by*: the perspective shift activity (Roman vs. Briton views)
- **Significance is just importance**: Pupils need explicit criteria. *Address by*: teaching the 3 criteria (remembered, resulting, remarkable)

> **Data source**: All misconceptions from concept `common_misconceptions` fields. This is one of the graph's strongest features for History — the misconceptions are specific, well-articulated, and directly actionable.

---

## 10. Worked Examples / Model Historical Arguments ❌

**What the graph provides**: Teaching guidance that says to "use 'because' and 'therefore' to structure causal arguments" and to "rank or categorise" causes. The concept data mentions structuring "causal relationships in written historical argument."

**What a teacher needs**: A model answer showing what a good causal argument looks like at Y4 level. For example:

> *Model answer (invented by me):*
> "The Romans invaded Britain for several reasons. One important cause was that Britain had resources the Romans wanted, like tin and gold. Another cause was that Emperor Claudius needed a military victory to show he was a strong leader. These causes worked together — Claudius chose to invade Britain because it would give him both the resources and the glory he needed. This tells us that big historical events usually have more than one cause."

The graph provides no worked examples, model answers, or annotated pupil writing. This is a significant gap — Y4 pupils need to SEE what a historical argument looks like before they can write one.

> **Data source**: Teaching guidance from concepts. No worked examples exist in the graph.

## 11. Practice Activities / Enquiry Tasks ⚠️

**Activities designed using graph data + teacher input:**

| Activity | Interaction Type (from graph) | Graph Data Used | Teacher-Invented |
|----------|-------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Vindolanda source analysis | `inference_task` (Socratic) | Source name, museum URL | Extract text, questions |
| Cause sorting into categories | `drag_categorise` | Concept teaching guidance | 8 cause cards, categories |
| Consequence matching pairs | `matching_pairs` | Key events, period dates | Card content, pairings |
| Significance writing frame | `text_input_phrase` | Significance criteria from C002 | Frame design, sentence starters |
| Chronological ordering | `drag_reorder` | Key events from CV002 | — (events directly from graph) |
| Multiple choice assessment | `multi_choice_4` | Misconceptions for distractors | Question, options, feedback |
| Perspective discussion | oral (not a graph interaction) | Perspectives from CV002 | Discussion prompts |

> **Data source**: Interaction types from Y4 learner profile. Activity content partly from graph (events, sources, vocabulary, misconceptions) and partly invented. The graph gives excellent raw material but no complete activities.

---

## 12. Cross-Curricular Links ⚠️

**English (Y4) — from graph structure:**
- Historical writing links to English curriculum: constructing arguments (claim + evidence + reasoning) maps to EN-Y4 writing composition objectives
- Vocabulary work: Latin-derived English words (e.g. "aqua" → aqueduct) supports English vocabulary/etymology objectives
- The diary entry extension activity (writing from two perspectives) supports both History and English

**Geography — from graph:**
- Map work: Roman Empire extent, trade routes (connects to GE-KS2 map skills)
- Understanding of why rivers and terrain mattered for Roman settlement

**Maths — from graph:**
- Timeline work: calculating time elapsed (43 AD to 410 AD = 367 years; 410 AD to 2026 = 1,616 years)

**Art — from graph:**
- Roman mosaic design (connects to Art KS2 craft/design objectives)

> **Data source**: Cross-curricular links are **not explicitly modelled** in the graph. The graph has no CROSS_CURRICULAR or LINKS_TO relationship between subjects. I inferred these from my knowledge of the curriculum. The `SUPPORTS_LEARNING_OF` relationship on InteractionTypes links to Subject, but that's about interaction suitability, not content connections. This is a real gap.

---

## Reflection: What the Graph Gave Me vs. What I Needed

### Strengths
The graph gave me a solid structural foundation: clear concepts with teaching guidance, well-articulated misconceptions, a content vehicle with sources/events/perspectives/definitions, thinking lens prompts that shaped my enquiry approach, prerequisite chains showing what pupils should already know, and a learner profile that guided my interaction design and feedback tone.

### Gaps
I spent most of my planning time inventing the actual teaching activities, resources, and differentiated tasks. The graph tells me WHAT to teach and WHY, but not HOW — it provides no starter activities, no printable resources, no source extracts, no model answers, no assessment rubrics, and no differentiation scaffolds. For History specifically, the absence of actual source materials (the graph names sources but doesn't provide usable texts or images) is the most critical gap.
