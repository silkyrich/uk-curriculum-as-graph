# Gap Analysis: Ms. Brennan — Y3 Mathematics (Fractions)

**Cluster:** MA-Y3-D004-CL001 — Understand unit and non-unit fractions with small denominators
**Date:** February 2026
**Reviewer:** Ms. Brennan, Y3 class teacher, 8 years experience, mastery approach

---

## Section-by-Section Analysis

### 1. Learning Objectives — ✅ SUFFICIENT

**What the graph provided:**
- Three statutory objectives (MA-Y3-O014, O015, O016) with full text
- Three concept descriptions with detailed mastery definitions
- Concept types (knowledge) and teaching weights (2, 3, 3)
- Curriculum context paragraph explaining the Y3 fractions trajectory

**What was missing:**
- Nothing material. The objectives + concept descriptions + curriculum context gave me everything needed to write clear learning objectives.

**What I had to invent:**
- The "by the end of this lesson, pupils will..." bullet points were synthesised from concept descriptions and DifficultyLevel "expected" tiers, but all the content was there.

---

### 2. Success Criteria — ⚠️ PARTIAL

**What the graph provided:**
- DifficultyLevel tiers (entry/developing/expected/greater depth) with specific, assessable example tasks for each concept
- These mapped perfectly to differentiated success criteria tiers ("all/most/some")
- Example tasks were specific enough to convert directly into "I can" statements

**What was missing:**
- No explicit success criteria or "I can" statements — these had to be derived
- No guidance on which DL tier constitutes "meeting the expected standard" for reporting purposes (I assumed "expected" = age-related expectations, which is consistent with KS2 assessment language, but this wasn't stated)

**What I had to invent:**
- The "I can" framing and selection of which DL tasks to foreground as criteria
- The mapping of entry/developing/expected/greater depth to all/most/some

**Verdict:** DifficultyLevels made this dramatically easier than it would have been without them. The data was 80% there — I just needed to reformat it.

---

### 3. Prior Knowledge Required — ⚠️ PARTIAL

**What the graph provided:**
- Within-cluster prerequisite: C025 → C026 (unit fractions before non-unit fractions) — clear and useful
- Cross-domain CO_TEACHES: MA-Y3-C007 (place value) ↔ MA-Y3-C024 (tenths) with rationale
- Y2 concept name: MA-Y2-C012 "Fractions as 'fractions of': 1/3, 1/4, 2/4, 3/4"
- Curriculum context text: "pupils extend their understanding of fractions significantly beyond the simple halves and quarters of KS1"

**What was missing:**
- No explicit PREREQUISITE_OF relationship from Y2 fraction concepts into Y3 fraction concepts — I had to look up Y2-C012 separately and infer the link
- No "assumed prior knowledge" property on the cluster or concepts
- No diagnostic assessment questions for checking prerequisite knowledge

**What I had to invent:**
- The specific Y2 skills to check (partitioning into halves/quarters, equal sharing)
- The diagnostic starter activity
- The connection between Y2-C016 (time/quarters) and fraction language

**Verdict:** The within-cluster and cross-domain prerequisite data was excellent. The gap is the missing cross-year prerequisite chain — Y2 fractions clearly feeds into Y3 fractions, but this isn't modelled as a PREREQUISITE_OF relationship.

---

### 4. Lesson Structure with Timings — ⚠️ PARTIAL

**What the graph provided:**
- Pedagogy profile session sequence: challenge_problem → guided_exploration → worked_example → independent_practice → retrieval_practice — this is a complete lesson flow
- Productive failure research: Sinha & Kapur 2021, d=0.36-0.58 — justified the challenge-first approach
- Interleaving research: Bjork 2011, d=0.42 — structured the plenary
- Session length: 12-20 minutes (digital session)
- Scaffolding level: moderate_to_high
- Hint tiers: max 3

**What was missing:**
- No model for a 60-minute classroom lesson — the pedagogy profile is for digital sessions (12-20 min)
- No timings for each phase (I allocated 10/35/15 based on professional judgment)
- No guidance on transition between concrete → pictorial → abstract within a single lesson
- No teacher talk scripts or model dialogues
- No guidance on table grouping, classroom organisation, or TA deployment

**What I had to invent:**
- The three-phase structure (intro/main/plenary) with specific timings
- How to expand a 15-min digital sequence into a 60-min classroom lesson
- The CPA (concrete-pictorial-abstract) progression within the main activity
- Specific teacher instructions and dialogue

**Verdict:** The pedagogy profile gave me the pedagogical PRINCIPLES (challenge first, productive failure, interleaving) but not the classroom LOGISTICS. For a digital lesson, the sequence would be directly usable. For a 60-min classroom lesson, significant teacher expertise was needed to flesh it out.

---

### 5. Key Vocabulary with Definitions — ✅ SUFFICIENT

**What the graph provided:**
- `key_vocabulary` property on each concept node with 8-10 terms per concept
- Full overlap between the three concepts ensured completeness
- Terms: tenth, one tenth, divide by ten, fraction, equal parts, number line, unit fraction, numerator, denominator, non-unit fraction, multiply, fraction of, parts, whole, fraction wall

**What was missing:**
- No child-friendly definitions — just the term lists
- No guidance on which terms to introduce first or how to sequence vocabulary introduction

**What I had to invent:**
- The definitions column (written from concept descriptions)
- Order of introduction aligned with lesson flow

**Verdict:** Term lists were complete. Definitions needed writing but the concept descriptions made this straightforward.

---

### 6. Resources and Materials Needed — ⚠️ PARTIAL

**What the graph provided:**
- Teaching guidance text named specific manipulatives: metre stick, fraction circles, fraction strips, fraction wall, paper strips, counters
- Interaction types listed digital tools: fraction_visualizer, number_line_scrubber, place_value_blocks
- Content guidelines specified number range (0-1000, simple fractions) and reading level

**What was missing:**
- No structured resource list — I extracted manipulative names from teaching guidance prose
- No printable worksheet templates or slide decks
- No content vehicles for fractions (none exist for KS2 Maths at all)
- No links to specific fraction wall images, number line templates, or worksheet generators
- No TA briefing notes

**What I had to invent:**
- The organised resource list (physical / digital / printed categories)
- Worksheet descriptions (fraction bar worksheets, exit ticket slips, challenge cards)
- The concept of "greater depth challenge cards" as a separate resource

---

### 7. Differentiation — ✅ SUFFICIENT

**What the graph provided:**
- DifficultyLevel nodes with 3-4 tiers per concept (entry/developing/expected/greater depth)
- Each tier has: `description` (what the child does), `example_task` (specific assessable task with exact wording), `example_response` (target answer), `common_errors` (what goes wrong at this level)
- Tier labels aligned with KS2 statutory assessment language
- 11 specific tasks across 3 concepts at 4 difficulty levels

**What was missing:**
- No guidance on HOW to group pupils (by prior attainment? Mixed ability tables?)
- No TA deployment notes (which group does the TA support?)
- No guidance on when to move a pupil between tiers during the lesson
- No adaptive pathways (if a child can't do Entry, what's the fallback?)

**What I had to invent:**
- Support strategies beyond the tasks themselves (pre-teaching, paired working, sentence stems)
- The hint tier examples (adapted from pedagogy profile hint_notes but made fraction-specific)

**Verdict:** THIS IS THE HEADLINE FINDING. The DifficultyLevel data is transformative for differentiation. Every differentiated task came directly from the graph. In 8 years of teaching, I have never had differentiation data this specific handed to me at planning time. The entry-level tasks with "use counters/fold paper" are genuinely appropriate for struggling learners. The greater depth tasks ("What fraction is left?", "Is 1/10 greater or less than 1/4?") are genuinely challenging. I did not have to invent a single differentiated task — I only had to organise them into a lesson structure.

---

### 8. Assessment Opportunities — ⚠️ PARTIAL

**What the graph provided:**
- 7 content domain codes (3F1, 3F1a, 3F1b, 3F1c, 3F2, 3F3, 3F4) mapped to specific concepts — tells me exactly what's formally assessed
- Mastery threshold: 5 correct in 7 days (80%) — useful for follow-up planning
- Spacing interval: 2-7 days — tells me when to revisit
- DifficultyLevel tasks double as assessment items (entry = diagnostic, expected = summative)

**What was missing:**
- No formative assessment plan (when in the lesson to assess, what to look for)
- No rubric or mark scheme
- No guidance on recording assessment (class tracker? Annotated seating plan?)
- No link between DifficultyLevel tiers and formal teacher assessment judgments (working towards / expected / greater depth)

**What I had to invent:**
- The six formative assessment points and what to observe at each
- The exit ticket design
- Assessment recording method

---

### 9. Common Misconceptions — ✅ SUFFICIENT

**What the graph provided:**
- Detailed `common_misconceptions` text on each concept node
- 6 specific misconceptions across the 3 concepts, with clear descriptions
- Misconceptions were specific and actionable (e.g. "larger denominators mean larger fractions" not just "pupils struggle with fractions")
- The bigger-denominator misconception appeared on both C024 and C025, reinforcing its importance

**What was missing:**
- No explicit remediation strategies (how to address each misconception)
- No diagnostic questions specifically designed to surface each misconception

**What I had to invent:**
- The "How to Address" column with specific teaching responses
- The pizza analogy and fraction wall comparison for the bigger-denominator misconception

**Verdict:** The misconception data is excellent — specific, well-documented, and directly useful for planning. This is one of the graph's strongest features.

---

### 10. Worked Examples — ⚠️ PARTIAL

**What the graph provided:**
- DifficultyLevel `example_task` and `example_response` — the problem and the answer
- Teaching guidance text with procedural descriptions (e.g. "Build from unit fractions: 'We know 1/4 of 20 = 5, so 3/4 of 20 = 3 x 5 = 15'")
- The pedagogy profile confirms worked examples are "Required" with format: "Text + diagram narrated. Step-by-step with child input at key points"

**What was missing:**
- No structured step-by-step worked examples — the graph has the problem and the answer but not the journey between them
- No teacher script for modelling ("Step 1: Read the fraction. The denominator is 4...")
- No "your turn" prompts embedded in the worked example
- No visual/diagrammatic worked examples (fraction bar diagrams, number line annotations)
- No common-error worked examples ("Here's what Jamie did wrong — can you spot the mistake?")

**What I had to invent:**
- The complete step-by-step structure for each worked example
- The teacher modelling dialogue
- The "check" step at the end of each example
- The visual representation descriptions

**Verdict:** The DL data gives me the problems and the target answers. The teaching guidance gives me the METHOD in prose form. But I had to construct the actual step-by-step worked examples myself. This is a significant gap — worked examples are the most time-consuming part of lesson planning to create from scratch. A `worked_example_steps` property on each DifficultyLevel node would be transformative.

---

### 11. Practice Questions (Graduated Difficulty) — ✅ SUFFICIENT

**What the graph provided:**
- DifficultyLevel `example_task` properties across 3 concepts × 3-4 levels = 11 specific questions
- Clear difficulty progression within each concept (concrete → pictorial → abstract → reasoning)
- Questions were well-calibrated to Y3 expectations
- Greater depth questions genuinely required multi-step reasoning

**What was missing:**
- Only 1 question per concept per difficulty level — a real lesson needs 3-4 at each level
- No answer key or mark scheme
- No "mild/spicy/hot" or similar child-friendly difficulty labels

**What I had to invent:**
- 3 additional questions (adapted from DL patterns with changed numbers)
- Question 14 (combining fractions as a greater depth extension)

**Verdict:** The DL data provided the STRUCTURE and EXEMPLARS for graduated practice. For a single lesson's worth of questions, 11 tasks is close to sufficient. For a homework sheet or a full week's practice, more would be needed — but the patterns are clear enough to generate additional questions in the same style. This section rates ✅ because the exemplar quality is high enough to teach from directly.

---

### 12. Cross-Curricular Links — ⚠️ PARTIAL

**What the graph provided:**
- Cross-domain CO_TEACHES link: place value (MA-Y3-C007) ↔ tenths (MA-Y3-C024) with rationale
- 6 epistemic skills (Mathematical Reasoning KS2) with descriptions
- Curriculum context paragraph referencing decimal notation in Y4

**What was missing:**
- No cross-subject links (fractions ↔ Science measurement, fractions ↔ Music note values, fractions ↔ DT recipes)
- No DEVELOPS_SKILL links from fractions concepts to any epistemic skill
- No content vehicle links (no Maths vehicles exist at all)

**What I had to invent:**
- All non-Maths cross-curricular connections (Science measurement, DT cooking, PE grouping, Music note values)

---

## Overall Assessment

### Readiness Score: 7.5 / 10

**Could I teach this lesson as-is from only graph data?** Almost. The graph gave me:
- Complete learning objectives and statutory context (✅)
- Excellent differentiation via DifficultyLevels (✅)
- Comprehensive misconceptions (✅)
- Good graduated practice questions (✅)
- Strong pedagogical framework from the learner profile (✅)
- Key vocabulary (✅)

**What stopped it being a 9 or 10:**
- Had to construct worked examples from ingredients rather than receiving them ready-made (-1)
- Had to design the 60-min classroom lesson structure myself — the pedagogy profile models 15-min digital sessions (-0.5)
- No content vehicles or physical resource templates for Maths (-0.5)
- Limited cross-year prerequisite chains (-0.5)

---

### DifficultyLevel Verdict

**Did the DL data help?** Yes. Emphatically yes.

**How much?** The DifficultyLevel data transformed three sections:
1. **Differentiation (Section 7)** — from ❌ to ✅. Without DL data, I would have had to invent every differentiated task. With DL data, every task came from the graph.
2. **Practice Questions (Section 11)** — from ⚠️ to ✅. 11 graduated questions across 4 difficulty tiers, calibrated to Y3. I added 3 more for variety.
3. **Success Criteria (Section 2)** — from ❌ to ⚠️. The DL tier descriptions effectively wrote the success criteria; I just added "I can" framing.

It also significantly supported:
4. **Worked Examples (Section 10)** — DL gave me problems + answers at each tier, and teaching guidance gave me the method. I had to construct the step-by-step format, but the raw material was there.

**Comparison with non-DL planning:** In 8 years of teaching, differentiation has always been the hardest and most time-consuming part of planning. Typically I spend 30-40 minutes per lesson creating differentiated tasks across 3-4 ability bands. The DL data gave me this in seconds. The tasks were specific, assessable, appropriately calibrated, and aligned with KS2 assessment language (entry/developing/expected/greater depth). This is a genuine step change.

**What would make DL data better?**
1. **Worked example steps** — Add a `worked_example_steps` array to each DifficultyLevel with the step-by-step procedure, not just the problem and answer
2. **Common errors per level** — The `common_errors` property exists but wasn't populated on every level; making this consistent would help
3. **More than one example per level** — One exemplar task is enough to understand the tier; three would make it classroom-ready without teacher adaptation
4. **Suggested manipulatives per level** — Entry levels should explicitly list "use counters/fraction circles"; expected levels should say "number line only"
5. **Child-friendly tier labels** — "Entry" and "Greater Depth" are teacher language; something like "Getting Started / Building / Secure / Challenge" would help for self-selection

### Top 5 Data Additions to Improve Lesson Planning

1. **Worked example steps on DifficultyLevel nodes** — A `worked_example_steps` property with ordered procedural steps would eliminate the biggest remaining planning burden. This is the single highest-impact addition.

2. **Content Vehicles for KS2 Maths** — No Maths vehicles exist. A "Fractions of pizza" or "Fraction wall exploration" vehicle with concrete resources, context, and assessment guidance would bring Maths to parity with History/Geography/Science.

3. **Cross-year PREREQUISITE_OF links** — Y2 fractions (halves, quarters) clearly feeds into Y3 fractions, but this isn't modelled. Adding explicit cross-year prerequisites would make prior knowledge sections write themselves.

4. **60-minute classroom lesson template** — The pedagogy profile models 15-min digital sessions. A parallel `classroom_lesson_structure` with suggested timings and phase guidance for standard 60-min lessons would dramatically improve lesson structure sections.

5. **Multiple example tasks per DifficultyLevel** — Currently 1 per level. Three per level would give teachers a full week's differentiated practice without adaptation.

| `ConceptCluster.classroom_lesson_structure` | Object | Timings + phases for a 60-min lesson |
| `ConceptCluster.success_criteria` | Array of strings | Pre-written "I can" statements per tier |
| `DifficultyLevel.diagnostic_question` | String | A question designed to surface the misconception at this level |

## Teaching Artefacts Needed

*What I'd need to go from "lesson plan on paper" to "ready to teach at 9am Monday" — for Y3 Maths, fractions, mastery approach.*

### Top 5 (Priority Order)

**1. Differentiated practice worksheets (print)**

This is the single biggest time cost between plan and classroom. I need three versions of the same worksheet — one per ability band — each with 8-10 questions at the appropriate DifficultyLevel tier. For this fractions lesson:
- **Support sheet**: Entry/Developing tasks with fraction bar diagrams pre-drawn, sentence stems ("The denominator is ___, so I need ___ equal groups"), and space for concrete working (draw your counters)
- **Core sheet**: Developing/Expected tasks with blank fraction bars to complete and number lines to label
- **Challenge sheet**: Expected/Greater Depth tasks with multi-step problems and "explain your reasoning" prompts

Why it matters: The DifficultyLevel data gave me the QUESTIONS (this is the breakthrough). But I still need them laid out on paper with appropriate visual scaffolding, spacing, and a clean format children can write on. Currently I spend 20-30 minutes per lesson formatting these in Word. If the system generated print-ready PDFs from DL data, that time drops to zero.

**2. Worked example slides / IWB resource (project)**

For the "I do" phase of my lesson, I need 2-3 slides that walk through a worked example step by step, with:
- A fraction bar or number line visual that builds progressively (click to reveal each step)
- The procedural steps written alongside (Step 1: Find the denominator → Step 2: Divide into equal groups → Step 3: Count one group)
- A "your turn" problem at the end of each example for paired talk

Why it matters: The teaching guidance text describes the procedure in prose, but I need it as a VISUAL SEQUENCE that I can project and talk through. Building these slides takes 15-20 minutes. The graph has the procedure (in teaching guidance) and the problems (in DL data) — it just needs to combine them into a presentable format.

**3. Manipulative templates (print and cut)**

For Y3 fractions specifically:
- **Fraction strips** — pre-printed strips divided into halves, thirds, quarters, fifths, eighths, tenths (A4, landscape, one set per child)
- **Fraction wall** — A3 poster showing all fraction families aligned, for each table group
- **Blank fraction bars** — empty bars with division lines for children to shade, in various denominators

Why it matters: Our school has fraction circles and counters, but fraction strips/walls need printing fresh for each unit because children write on them. The graph's teaching guidance specifically recommends these manipulatives ("Use fraction walls as the primary pictorial tool", "Fraction strips or circles divided into 10 equal sectors"). Generating printable templates from the concept data (which knows the denominators: halves, thirds, quarters, fifths, eighths, tenths) would save 15 minutes of hunting on TES/Twinkl.

**4. Knowledge organiser (print, stick in books)**

A single A4 page that children keep in the front of their maths books, containing:
- Key vocabulary with child-friendly definitions (the graph provides the terms; I'd add definitions)
- The core concept: "A fraction means EQUAL PARTS. The bottom number = how many parts. The top number = how many we're counting."
- Visual models: fraction wall, number line with fractions placed, fraction bar showing 3/4
- Method: "To find a fraction of an amount: DIVIDE by the denominator, then MULTIPLY by the numerator"
- Common mistakes to avoid: "1/8 is NOT bigger than 1/3 — more pieces = smaller pieces!"

Why it matters: In a mastery classroom, the knowledge organiser is the reference tool children use during independent practice. It reduces reliance on the teacher and builds independence. The graph has ALL the content (vocabulary, misconceptions, methods) — it just needs assembling into a single-page visual format.

**5. Exit ticket / mini-assessment (print, 1/4 A4)**

A quick 3-question assessment slip for the last 5 minutes, with:
- Q1: Entry level ("Find 1/4 of 12 counters")
- Q2: Expected level ("Find 3/5 of 25")
- Q3: Greater depth ("There are 30 stickers. Amara uses 2/5 of them. How many are left?")

Why it matters: This is how I know WHO understood and WHO needs same-day intervention. The DifficultyLevel data provides perfect questions for this — one per tier. The system could generate a daily exit ticket from DL example_tasks with almost no adaptation. This is a 5-minute job currently, but across 5 lessons a week it adds up.

### Honourable Mentions (Not Top 5, But Useful)

- **Vocabulary cards / word mat** (table resource): Terms with definitions + visual. Graph has the terms, I'd add images. Lower priority because the knowledge organiser covers this.
- **Homework sheet**: Similar to the core practice worksheet but with 5 questions spanning Entry-Expected. Useful but not essential for a single lesson.
- **Parent-facing summary**: "This week in Maths, we are learning about fractions. Here's how to help at home: cut a pizza into equal slices and ask 'what fraction did we eat?'" Nice to have, not essential.
- **Marking rubric / assessment grid**: A class tracker mapping children against DL tiers. The DL data would power this beautifully — each tier becomes a column, tick off where each child is. But this is a unit-level artefact, not a single-lesson one.
- **Working wall materials** (display): Large-format vocabulary cards and method posters for the classroom wall. Updated weekly. Useful but I'd build these from the knowledge organiser.

### What the Graph Could Generate Today vs What Needs Design Work

| Artefact | Graph data available? | Generation feasibility |
|---|---|---|
| Differentiated worksheets | ✅ DL tasks at 4 tiers | Needs layout/formatting engine — the QUESTIONS exist, the PDF doesn't |
| Worked example slides | ⚠️ Teaching guidance + DL tasks | Needs visual diagram generation + step decomposition |
| Manipulative templates | ⚠️ Denominator data from concepts | Needs SVG/PDF generation — the PARAMETERS exist (which denominators) |
| Knowledge organiser | ✅ Vocabulary + misconceptions + methods | Needs single-page layout engine — all CONTENT exists |
| Exit tickets | ✅ DL tasks at 3 tiers | Easiest to generate — 3 questions from DL data, minimal formatting |

**Bottom line:** The graph data is sufficient to POPULATE 4 of 5 artefacts. The gap is a formatting/rendering layer that turns structured data into print-ready documents. Exit tickets could be generated tomorrow with almost no new infrastructure. Differentiated worksheets and knowledge organisers need a layout engine but the content is there. Worked example slides are the hardest because they need visual diagram generation (fraction bars, number lines) — that's a design problem, not a data problem.

---

### Final Reflection

This is the most data-rich lesson planning experience I've had outside of a published scheme. The combination of concept descriptions + teaching guidance + misconceptions + DifficultyLevels + pedagogy profile + interaction types gave me about 75% of what I need for a complete lesson. The remaining 25% — worked example construction, classroom logistics, resource preparation, and cross-curricular connections — is the professional craft of teaching that probably shouldn't be fully automated anyway.

The DifficultyLevel pilot on Y3 Maths is a clear success. Rolling this out to all year groups and subjects should be a priority. The difference between planning with DL data (Section 7: differentiation wrote itself) and planning without it (where I would have spent 30+ minutes creating tasks) is the difference between "data-informed planning" and "planning from scratch with a concept list."

**Score: 7.5/10** — with the top 5 additions above, this could reach 9/10.
