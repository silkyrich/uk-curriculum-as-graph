## Section-by-Section Assessment

### 1. Learning Objectives ✅
| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Available data** | Rich | Concept descriptions, teaching guidance, key vocabulary, curriculum context, objectives (O010-O012), DEVELOPS_SKILL links to HistoricalThinking skills, ThinkingLens with agent prompts |
| **Missing data** | Minor | No year-specific objective granularity (objectives are KS2-wide, not Y4-specific) |
| **What I invented** | Nothing | The enquiry question was synthesised from the ThinkingLens prompt + content vehicle, but all content came from graph |
| **Rating** | **9/10** | Excellent. The combination of curriculum objectives + concept descriptions + historical thinking skills + thinking lens gave me everything needed. The enquiry question practically wrote itself from the Cause and Effect lens key question. |

### 2. Success Criteria ⚠️
| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Available data** | Moderate | Content vehicle has 4 `success_criteria`. Concept teaching guidance describes expected outcomes |
| **Missing data** | Significant | No differentiated success criteria (all/most/some). No difficulty levels for History — DifficultyLevel only piloted for Y3 Maths |
| **What I invented** | The three-tier differentiation (all/most/some), the specific pupil-facing language |
| **Rating** | **5/10** | The 4 success criteria from the content vehicle are a decent starting point but they're assessor-facing ("Can pupils explain..."), not pupil-facing ("I can..."). Without difficulty levels, I had to invent the differentiated tiers entirely. |

### 3. Prior Knowledge Required ✅
| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Available data** | Strong | PREREQUISITE_OF relationships: HI-KS1-C001→C001, KS1-C002→C002, KS1-C004→C002/C003. Clear chain from KS1 to KS2 |
| **Missing data** | Minor | No within-KS2 sequencing between content vehicles (which topic should come before which). No diagnostic assessment for prerequisite gaps |
| **What I invented** | The assumption that Stone Age to Iron Age should precede Roman Britain (logical but not in graph) |
| **Rating** | **8/10** | Prerequisite chains are genuinely useful. Knowing that "Time and Chronology" feeds into "Cause and Consequence" told me exactly what foundational skills to assume. |

### 4. Lesson Structure with Timings ⚠️
| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Available data** | Structural only | Y4 pedagogy profile gives session sequence (challenge_problem → exploration → instruction → independent_practice → retrieval_practice), productive failure = appropriate, session length 15-25 min, scaffolding level = moderate |
| **Missing data** | Substantial | No lesson plan templates, no activity suggestions, no timing guidance within the sequence, no starter/main/plenary structure. The 15-25 min session length is for digital AI sessions, not classroom lessons — a 60-min classroom lesson requires substantial adaptation |
| **What I invented** | The entire lesson narrative: hook, source encounter, cause sorting, consequence mapping, significance writing, chronological ordering, multiple choice, exit reflection. All timings. All transitions between activities |
| **Rating** | **4/10** | The pedagogy profile gave me a useful SEQUENCE (productive failure first, then exploration, then instruction, then practice) which genuinely shaped my lesson structure. But I had to invent every activity, every transition, and every timing. The session length mismatch (digital 15-25 min vs. classroom 60 min) is notable — the graph is designed for AI tutoring sessions, not classroom lessons. |

### 5. Key Vocabulary with Definitions ✅
| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Available data** | Strong | 9 definitions from content vehicle. 15+ key terms from concept `key_vocabulary` fields |
| **Missing data** | Minor | Definitions not age-banded (same definition for Y3 and Y6). No Tier 2/Tier 3 vocabulary classification |
| **What I invented** | Simplified the definitions for Y4 readability. Selected the most relevant terms from the longer lists |
| **Rating** | **8/10** | Vocabulary is one of the graph's strongest areas. The content vehicle definitions are specific to Roman Britain, and the concept-level vocabulary covers the disciplinary terms. I just needed to simplify for Y4. |

### 6. Resources and Materials Needed ⚠️
| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Available data** | Names only | Content vehicle lists: sources (Vindolanda tablets, Roman coins, Bath remains, Hadrian's Wall), source_types (primary written, archaeological, built heritage), resource_types (museum_collection, heritage_site), URLs (British Museum, English Heritage) |
| **Missing data** | Critical | No actual source extracts or transcripts. No images. No simplified texts for Y4. No downloadable/printable resources. No worksheets, card sorts, or writing frames. The graph names sources but provides no usable content |
| **What I invented** | Every physical resource: cause cards, matching cards, writing frames, simplified source extracts. Teachers would need to visit the British Museum website, find the Vindolanda collection, select an appropriate tablet, and simplify the transcript themselves |
| **Rating** | **3/10** | This is the biggest gap. History teaching depends on sources — you cannot teach historical enquiry without giving pupils something to analyse. The graph tells me "Vindolanda tablets" exist and links to the British Museum, but a Y4 teacher needs an age-appropriate extract ready to project on the whiteboard. The gap between "source exists" and "source is usable in a Y4 classroom" is enormous. |

### 7. Differentiation ⚠️
| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Available data** | Partial | Y4 learner profile provides: scaffolding = moderate, hint_tiers_max = 3, secondary interaction types for reduced complexity (multi_choice_3). Content vehicle lists 4 perspectives (useful for extension). Concept teaching guidance mentions ranking causes (extension-level thinking) |
| **Missing data** | Significant | No difficulty levels (DifficultyLevel not available for History). No SEND guidance. No EAL scaffolds. No specific support strategies. No pre-teaching suggestions for pupils with gaps |
| **What I invented** | All specific differentiation strategies: reducing cards, providing word banks, pairing strategies, sentence starters, extension diary writing |
| **Rating** | **4/10** | The hint tiers and secondary interaction types give some structural differentiation for the digital platform, but for classroom planning I had to invent everything. The DifficultyLevel layer (piloted for Y3 Maths) would be transformative here — entry/developing/expected/greater_depth tiers with example tasks would directly generate my all/most/some criteria. |

### 8. Assessment Opportunities ⚠️
| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Available data** | Partial | Content vehicle has 1 paragraph of `assessment_guidance`. Success criteria from CV. Misconceptions provide distractor material for MC questions. Y4 feedback profile specifies assessment style |
| **Missing data** | Significant | No per-activity rubrics. No marking criteria. No exemplar pupil responses. No formative assessment checkpoints. No exit ticket templates. No link to KS2 assessment frameworks for History (only Maths/English have ContentDomainCodes) |
| **What I invented** | All formative assessment points, the multiple choice question with its distractors and feedback, the exit reflection |
| **Rating** | **4/10** | The assessment_guidance paragraph is genuinely useful — it tells me exactly what to assess. But it's one paragraph. A classroom teacher needs per-activity assessment criteria, exemplar responses showing what "working towards" vs. "expected" looks like, and a marking guide. |

### 9. Common Misconceptions to Address ✅
| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Available data** | Excellent | 3 detailed misconceptions for HI-KS2-C001 (single-cause, correlation/causation, unintended consequences). 3 for HI-KS2-C002 (significance=fame, significance is fixed, need explicit criteria). Each includes an explanation of why it's wrong and how to address it |
| **Missing data** | Very minor | No age-specific misconception prevalence data. No pupil language examples ("pupils often say...") |
| **What I invented** | Nothing — I used the misconceptions directly from the graph |
| **Rating** | **9/10** | This is the graph's standout feature for History. The misconceptions are specific, well-explained, and directly actionable. The single-cause misconception for Cause and Consequence directly shaped my cause-sorting activity. |

### 10. Worked Examples / Model Historical Arguments ❌
| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Available data** | Minimal | Teaching guidance says to "structure causal arguments" using "because" and "therefore". No actual examples |
| **Missing data** | Critical | No model answers at any level. No annotated writing showing what good historical argument looks like. No WAGOLL (What A Good One Looks Like). No progression in argument complexity from Y3→Y6 |
| **What I invented** | The entire model answer for a causal argument |
| **Rating** | **1/10** | History teaching — particularly historical enquiry — depends on modelling. Pupils need to see what a historical argument looks like before they write one. The graph provides structural advice ("use because and therefore") but no concrete examples. This is the weakest area alongside resources. |

### 11. Practice Activities / Enquiry Tasks ⚠️
| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Available data** | Structural | Interaction types give activity FORMATS (drag to categorise, matching pairs, text input, Socratic questioning, chronological ordering). Key events from CV give sequencing content. Misconceptions give MC distractors |
| **Missing data** | Substantial | No complete activities. No task instructions. No card sort content. No source analysis scaffolds. No enquiry question progressions. No groupwork structures |
| **What I invented** | All activity content: 8 cause cards, 5 consequence pairs, significance writing frame, MC question, discussion prompts |
| **Rating** | **5/10** | The interaction types are genuinely useful — they gave me a palette of activity formats appropriate for Y4. The key events data meant I didn't have to research Roman Britain chronology. But every activity had to be built from scratch. |

### 12. Cross-Curricular Links ⚠️
| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Available data** | Minimal | `SUPPORTS_LEARNING_OF` links InteractionType→Subject (about interaction suitability). CO_TEACHES exists within/across subjects but not for History disciplinary concepts. No explicit cross-curricular relationship type |
| **Missing data** | Significant | No LINKS_TO or CROSS_CURRICULAR relationship. No English-History writing connections. No Geography-History map skill connections. No Maths-History timeline calculation connections |
| **What I invented** | All cross-curricular links (English writing, Geography maps, Maths timelines, Art mosaics) |
| **Rating** | **3/10** | Cross-curricular planning is essential in primary schools — Y4 teachers plan across subjects daily. The graph treats subjects as silos. The CO_TEACHES relationship exists for within-subject concept connections but nothing bridges History and English or History and Geography at the content level. |

---

## Overall Readiness Score

### **5.5 / 10**

The graph provides excellent **structural and conceptual** support for History lesson planning — I know WHAT to teach (concepts, objectives), WHY these concepts matter (curriculum context, misconceptions, thinking lenses), WHAT pupils should already know (prerequisites), HOW the AI should interact with them (learner profile), and WHAT content vehicle to use (Roman Britain with sources, events, perspectives). The thinking lenses are genuinely pedagogically useful — the Cause and Effect lens practically wrote my enquiry question.

But the graph falls dramatically short on the **operational layer** of lesson planning: the actual resources, source extracts, activities, model answers, differentiation scaffolds, and assessment rubrics that a teacher needs to walk into a classroom and teach. History has unique planning demands — it is a source-driven, enquiry-based discipline — and the gap between "we have a source called Vindolanda tablets" and "here is a Y4-appropriate extract with guided questions" is where 60% of my planning time went.

---

## History-Specific Gaps

### 1. Source Materials (Critical)
History teaching requires pupils to work with primary and secondary sources. The content vehicle names 4 sources and links to 2 museum websites, but provides no:
- Actual source extracts or transcripts
- Simplified/age-appropriate versions
- Source analysis scaffolds ("What can you see? Who made this? Why?")
- Images or visual sources
- Source provenance information (who made it, when, why)

### 2. Enquiry Scaffolds (Major)
Historical enquiry follows a structured process (question → hypothesise → investigate → conclude). The graph provides an enquiry-adjacent thinking lens but no:
- Enquiry question bank (graded by difficulty)
- Hypothesis frames ("I think... because...")
- Investigation scaffolds (how to use sources as evidence)
- Conclusion frames (how to write up findings)

### 3. Timeline and Chronological Data (Moderate)
The content vehicle provides `period` (43 AD - 410 AD) and `key_events` with dates. This is useful but:
- No visual timeline representations
- No "parallel timelines" (what was happening in Britain vs. the wider world)
- No duration/elapsed time calculations
- No chronological vocabulary progression (Y3 uses "a long time ago", Y6 uses "century", "millennium")

### 4. Multiple Perspectives Data (Moderate)
The `perspectives` property on content vehicles is excellent (Roman coloniser, Briton, Roman soldier, enslaved person). But:
- No source material written from each perspective
- No guided questions for perspective comparison
- No empathy task scaffolds
- No discussion of whose voices are missing from the historical record

### 5. Difficulty Levels for History (Major)
Y3 Maths has DifficultyLevel nodes with entry/developing/expected/greater_depth tiers, each with `description`, `example_task`, `example_response`, and `common_errors`. History has nothing equivalent. For a discipline where progression is notoriously hard to assess, this would be transformative.

---

## Top 5 Data Additions

### 1. **SourceMaterial nodes** (Priority: Critical)
New node type: `(:SourceMaterial)` linked via `(:ContentVehicle)-[:HAS_SOURCE]->(:SourceMaterial)`

Properties:
- `source_id`, `name`, `source_type` (primary_written, primary_archaeological, secondary, visual)
- `original_text` (full transcription)
- `simplified_text` (age-appropriate version, linked to Y4 Lexile 300-500L)
- `provenance` (who created it, when, why)
- `guided_questions` (array of analysis questions)
- `image_url` (for visual/archaeological sources)
- `perspective` (whose viewpoint does this source represent?)

This single addition would transform the graph's usefulness for History from "here are some source names" to "here is a teach-ready source pack."

### 2. **DifficultyLevel nodes for History concepts** (Priority: High)
Extend the Y3 Maths pilot to KS2 History. Each History concept gets 3-4 difficulty tiers:

- **Entry**: Identify one cause ("Name one reason the Romans invaded")
- **Developing**: Identify multiple causes ("List three reasons the Romans invaded")
- **Expected**: Categorise and explain causes ("Sort these causes into economic and political, and explain how they worked together")
- **Greater depth**: Evaluate and argue ("Which cause was most important? Use evidence to support your argument")

Each tier with `example_task`, `example_response`, `common_errors` — directly generating differentiated success criteria.

### 3. **WorkedExample nodes** (Priority: High)
New node type: `(:WorkedExample)` linked via `(:ConceptCluster)-[:HAS_WORKED_EXAMPLE]->(:WorkedExample)`

Properties:
- `example_id`, `year_group`, `difficulty_level`
- `task` (the question/prompt)
- `model_response` (annotated model answer)
- `annotations` (array: which parts demonstrate which skills)
- `common_errors_at_this_level` (what a weaker response looks like)

For History, this means model historical arguments at each year group showing what "good" looks like.

### 4. **ActivityTemplate nodes** (Priority: Medium)
New node type: `(:ActivityTemplate)` linked via `(:ConceptCluster)-[:HAS_ACTIVITY]->(:ActivityTemplate)`

Properties:
- `activity_id`, `activity_type` (links to InteractionType)
- `instructions` (teacher-facing)
- `pupil_instructions` (age-appropriate)
- `content` (the actual card sort items, matching pairs, MC questions, etc.)
- `differentiation_notes` (how to adapt for support/extension)
- `assessment_criteria` (what to look for)

This bridges the gap between "use drag_categorise" and "here is a complete categorisation activity."

### 5. **CrossCurricularLink relationships** (Priority: Medium)
New relationship: `(:Concept)-[:CROSS_CURRICULAR {link_type, description}]->(:Concept)`

Examples:
- HI-KS2-C001 (Cause and Consequence) -[:CROSS_CURRICULAR {type: "writing_genre"}]-> EN-Y4-Cxxx (Persuasive Writing)
- HI-KS2-C005 (British Historical Periods) -[:CROSS_CURRICULAR {type: "map_skills"}]-> GE-KS2-Cxxx (Map Skills)
- HI-KS2-C004 (Ancient Civilisations) -[:CROSS_CURRICULAR {type: "number_timeline"}]-> MA-Y4-Cxxx (Negative Numbers / Number Line)

This would make the graph genuinely useful for primary teachers who plan across subjects.

## Specific New Entities and Properties Wanted

### New Node Types
| Node | Properties | Relationships |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| `SourceMaterial` | source_id, name, type, original_text, simplified_text, provenance, guided_questions[], image_url, perspective, period | `HAS_SOURCE` from ContentVehicle, `REPRESENTS_PERSPECTIVE` linking to a perspective value |

| `ActivityTemplate` | activity_id, type, instructions, pupil_instructions, content{}, differentiation, assessment_criteria | `HAS_ACTIVITY` from ConceptCluster, `USES_INTERACTION` to InteractionType |
| `EnquiryQuestion` | question_id, question_text, difficulty, question_type (causal, significance, evidence, comparison) | `HAS_ENQUIRY` from ConceptCluster or ContentVehicle |

### New Properties on Existing Nodes
| Node | Property | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| ContentVehicle | `teaching_sequence_position` (int) | Order content vehicles within a topic (Stone Age before Roman Britain) |
| ContentVehicle | `parallel_world_events` (array) | What was happening elsewhere? (Useful for timeline comparisons) |
| Concept | `pupil_language_misconceptions` (array) | What pupils actually SAY ("The Romans came because they liked fighting") |

| DifficultyLevel | *(extend to History)* | entry/developing/expected/greater_depth with example_task, example_response |

### New Relationships
| Relationship | From | To | Properties |
|-------------|------|----|------------|
| `CROSS_CURRICULAR` | Concept | Concept | link_type, description, teaching_note |
| `TEACHES_BEFORE` | ContentVehicle | ContentVehicle | rationale (explicit teaching order) |
| `HAS_SOURCE` | ContentVehicle | SourceMaterial | relevance_note |
| `HAS_ENQUIRY` | ConceptCluster | EnquiryQuestion | — |

---

## Comparison with Other Subjects

As a History specialist, I note that **Maths has a significant structural advantage** in this graph:
- DifficultyLevel nodes with 4 tiers, each with concrete example tasks and responses (History: none)
- Worked example sets as a ContentVehicle type (History: only topic_study type)
- CO_TEACHES relationships between related concepts (History: some, but fewer)
- Clear within-year sequencing via domain structure (History: KS2-wide, not year-specific)

History's unique needs — source materials, enquiry scaffolds, multiple perspectives, chronological framing — are not well served by a graph model designed primarily around Maths and Science progression. The content vehicle layer is a good start (perspectives, key events, sources, definitions are all valuable), but it needs the SourceMaterial and WorkedExample layers to become truly teach-ready.

---

| Practice activities | 5/10 | Interaction types useful, no content |
| Cross-curricular | 3/10 | No cross-subject links modelled |
| **OVERALL** | **5.5/10** | Strong on WHAT and WHY, weak on HOW |

## Teaching Artefacts Needed

*What I would need to go from "lesson plan on paper" to "ready to teach at 9am Monday" — in priority order for Y4 History.*

### 1. Source Packs (Critical — History cannot be taught without them)

**What it is**: A curated set of 3-5 primary/secondary sources per content vehicle, each with:
- An age-appropriate extract or high-resolution image
- Provenance line ("This letter was written by a Roman soldier at Vindolanda fort in about 100 AD")
- 3 guided analysis questions, graded: observation ("What can you see?"), inference ("What does this tell us?"), evaluation ("How reliable is this source?")
- A simplified transcript (Lexile 300-500L for Y4) alongside the original where applicable

**Why it matters for History**: Historical enquiry IS source analysis. Without sources, pupils are learning about history, not doing history. My entire lesson — the Vindolanda tablet hook, the evidence-based inference task, the perspective discussion — depends on source materials the graph names but does not provide. I spent 40% of my planning time sourcing and simplifying materials. Every History teacher in the country does this for every lesson.

**What the graph currently provides**: Source names (e.g. "Vindolanda tablets"), source types (primary written, archaeological), and museum URLs. This is a menu without any food.

**What I'd generate from the graph**: `(:ContentVehicle)-[:HAS_SOURCE]->(:SourceMaterial)` nodes with `simplified_text`, `image_url`, `provenance`, `guided_questions[]`, and `perspective` properties. For Roman Britain alone, I'd want: Vindolanda tablet extract, a Roman coin image, a reconstruction drawing of a Roman town, a map of Roman roads, and an archaeological site photograph.

### 2. Knowledge Organisers (High — the single most-used classroom artefact in primary History)

**What it is**: A single-page A4 sheet that pupils keep in their books throughout a topic, containing:
- Key vocabulary with definitions (the graph HAS this — 9 definitions from the content vehicle + concept vocabulary)
- Timeline of key events (the graph HAS this — `key_events` from the content vehicle)
- Key figures (the graph HAS this — `key_figures` from the content vehicle)
- Key places on a map (the graph PARTIALLY has this — no map data but place names are inferable)
- An enquiry question (the graph has the thinking lens key question)
- "What I should already know" section (the graph HAS this — prerequisite concepts)

**Why it matters for History**: Knowledge organisers are the single most common planning artefact in English primary schools post-2018. Most schools mandate them. They serve as a reference sheet, a retrieval practice tool, and a parent-facing summary of the topic. The graph already has 70% of the data needed — vocabulary, events, figures, prerequisites — but no way to render it as a formatted A4 page.

**What the graph currently provides**: All the raw data. This is the artefact closest to being auto-generated today.

**What I'd generate**: A templated A4 layout pulling: `definitions` + `key_vocabulary` from concept nodes, `key_events` + `key_figures` + `period` from content vehicle, prerequisite concept names, and the thinking lens key question. This could be an automated export from the graph with minimal human editing.

### 3. Differentiated Activity Sheets (High — the main thing I print for each lesson)

**What it is**: 2-3 versions of the same activity at different difficulty levels:
- **Support version**: fewer items, word bank provided, sentence starters, visual scaffolds
- **Core version**: standard activity as designed
- **Extension version**: open-ended questions, evaluation tasks, additional challenge

For my Roman Britain lesson:
- Cause sorting: 5 cards (support) / 8 cards (core) / 8 cards + "rank the most important" (extension)
- Significance writing: word bank + sentence starters (support) / writing frame (core) / free writing with criteria checklist (extension)

**Why it matters for History**: Every class has pupils working at different levels. In my Y4 class, I have children reading at Y2 level and children capable of Y6-level reasoning. Without differentiated sheets, I'm teaching to the middle and losing both ends.

**What the graph currently provides**: Interaction types suggest activity formats. DifficultyLevel (if extended to History) would provide the tier structure. Concept misconceptions provide distractor material. But no complete activities exist.

**What I'd generate**: `(:ConceptCluster)-[:HAS_ACTIVITY]->(:ActivityTemplate)` with `content{}` at each difficulty level, linked to `(:DifficultyLevel)` tiers. Each template generates a printable worksheet.

### 4. Assessment Rubric / "I Can" Statements Grid (Medium — needed for every unit, used for marking and reporting)

**What it is**: A grid showing progression across the unit:

| Skill | Working towards | Expected | Greater depth |
|-------|----------------|----------|---------------|
| Causation | Names one cause | Explains multiple causes and categorises them | Evaluates which cause is most important with evidence |
| Significance | Says something is "important" | Applies criteria (remembered, resulting, remarkable) | Recognises significance is contested and perspective-dependent |
| Evidence use | Describes what a source shows | Makes inferences from a source | Evaluates the reliability of a source |

**Why it matters for History**: Schools require termly assessment judgements. Without a rubric, History assessment is impressionistic. The graph's misconceptions and concept descriptions contain the knowledge needed to write these statements, but they're buried in prose, not structured as progression grids.

**What the graph currently provides**: Concept descriptions describe what pupils should understand. DifficultyLevel (if extended) would directly map to grid columns. Assessment_guidance from content vehicles gives a paragraph of what to assess.

**What I'd generate**: Auto-generated from `DifficultyLevel` tiers per concept, with `example_task` and `example_response` populating the cells. This is the artefact that benefits most from the DifficultyLevel extension to History.

### 5. Timeline Display (Medium — essential for History, projected or wall-mounted throughout the topic)

**What it is**: A visual timeline showing:
- The period being studied (43 AD - 410 AD for Roman Britain)
- Key events placed on the timeline with dates and brief descriptions
- Contextual events ("What was happening elsewhere?")
- A "you are here" marker showing 2026 for perspective on elapsed time
- Visual scale showing the duration of the period relative to other periods studied

**Why it matters for History**: Chronological understanding is a foundational historical skill (it's a KS1 prerequisite: HI-KS1-C001 Time and Chronology). Every History lesson should have a visible timeline. My drag_reorder plenary activity depends on pupils having built a mental timeline throughout the lesson. A projected or printed timeline is the visual anchor for the whole topic.

**What the graph currently provides**: `key_events` with dates on content vehicles. `period` property with date range. Prerequisite chain to HI-KS1-C001 (Time and Chronology). But no visual timeline, no parallel events, and no rendering format.

**What I'd generate**: Auto-generated from `key_events` + `period` on ContentVehicle nodes, with optional `parallel_world_events` property. Rendered as a printable A3 strip or interactive whiteboard resource.

### Honourable mentions (not in top 5 but genuinely useful)

- **Vocabulary cards / word mat**: Could be auto-generated TODAY from content vehicle `definitions` + concept `key_vocabulary`. A4 sheet with terms, definitions, and images. Lowest-hanging fruit for the graph.
- **Marking rubric with exemplar responses**: Needs WorkedExample nodes. Shows what a "working towards" response looks like vs. "expected" vs. "greater depth".
- **Parent-facing topic summary**: 1-page PDF: "This half-term, your child is studying Roman Britain. Key vocabulary they will learn: ... Key dates: ... How you can help at home: visit [museum URL] ..." — could be 80% auto-generated from content vehicle data.
- **Homework retrieval quiz**: 5-10 questions for weekly retrieval practice. Could be generated from concept key vocabulary + content vehicle key events + misconceptions as distractors. The graph has the raw material; it just needs a quiz template.

### The gap in one sentence

The graph gives me a brilliant curriculum map and pedagogical framework, but between "here is your lesson plan" and "here is what you hand to 30 children at 9am" sits an entire production layer of printable, projectable, age-appropriate teaching materials that does not yet exist.
