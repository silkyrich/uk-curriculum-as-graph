## Overall Readiness Score: 5/10

The graph provides a solid **conceptual skeleton** for KS2 Geography — I could identify what to teach, in what sequence, with what vocabulary, against which misconceptions, and through which cognitive lens. That's genuinely useful and better than starting from scratch. But for a Y5 lesson on climate zones and the water cycle, the skeleton needs *flesh*: data sources, visual resources, fieldwork complexity, extended writing scaffolds, and differentiated assessment. Upper KS2 Geography demands more sophisticated enquiry than the graph currently supports.

## What the Graph Does Well for Y5 Geography

### Strengths

1. **Concept quality is high.** The descriptions for `GE-KS2-C002` (Climate Zones and Biomes) and `GE-KS2-C003` (River Systems and the Water Cycle) are detailed, accurate, and curriculum-aligned. They go beyond the bare National Curriculum statements to provide genuine teaching depth. I could hand these to an NQT and they'd understand the content.

2. **Misconception data is excellent.** Seven specific, named misconceptions across the two concepts — "deserts are always hot," "rivers flow uphill," "climate zone = biome" — each with enough detail to design targeted assessment. This is the single most useful planning data in the graph for a classroom teacher.

3. **Thinking lenses add genuine pedagogical value.** The Systems and System Models lens, with its age-banded KS2 prompt and four question stems, gave me a clear cognitive frame for the lesson. "What goes into this system, and what comes out?" is a question I'll actually use in class. The rationale explaining *why* the lens fits *this cluster* (water cycle as archetypal system) helped me plan, not just the generic lens description.

4. **Prerequisite chains are clear and accurate.** The graph told me pupils need KS1 Weather/Climate and KS2 Latitude/Longitude before this cluster. That's correct and useful — especially the keystone flag on the latitude concept, which tells me to assess readiness before starting.

5. **Geographical skill links exist and are useful.** The `DEVELOPS_SKILL` relationships from `GE-KS2-C002` to `Geographical enquiry` and `Fieldwork: data collection and presentation` directly informed my activity design. Knowing this cluster develops specific skills, not just knowledge, shaped the lesson.

6. **Y5 learner profile is well-calibrated.** The content guideline ("confident upper-primary reader, academic vocabulary OK, paragraph-length responses"), pedagogy profile (productive failure appropriate, faded worked examples, 4 hint tiers), and feedback profile (analytical_competence, peer_like_respectful) all rang true for my Y5 class. The session sequence especially — challenge_problem → exploration → instruction → faded_worked_example → independent_practice → retrieval_practice — gave me a lesson shape.

## What the Graph Lacks for Upper KS2 Geography

### Critical Gaps

#### 1. No KS2 Geography Content Vehicles (CRITICAL)

The graph has **10 content vehicles for KS3 Geography** (Haiti earthquake, Japan tsunami, Climate change, Nigeria development, Lagos/London urbanisation, etc.) but **zero for KS2**. This is the single biggest gap.

A KS2 Geography content vehicle would need to provide:
- **Case study regions** with curated data (e.g., "Amazon Rainforest" case study with area data, deforestation rates, indigenous populations, climate data)
- **Data points** — specific statistics, coordinates, measurements that pupils can interpret
- **Photograph/image references** — what visual resources to use
- **Source materials** — maps, climate graphs, satellite images
- **Assessment guidance** — how to assess geographical understanding, not just factual recall
- **Local connections** — how to connect global geography to UK/local contexts

Without vehicles, I'm generating every activity, resource, and data source from my own subject knowledge. The platform can't do this for a teacher who isn't a Geography specialist.

#### 2. No Difficulty Levels for Geography

The DifficultyLevel pilot (Y3 Maths) demonstrates exactly what's needed: `entry → developing → expected → greater_depth` with `description`, `example_task`, `example_response`, and `common_errors`. For Geography, this would look like:

| Level | Example for "Climate Zones and Biomes" |
|-------|---------------------------------------|
| **Entry** | Name 3 climate zones and match each to a biome from a word bank |
| **Developing** | Locate climate zones on a world map and explain the link between latitude and temperature |
| **Expected** | Compare two biomes using climate data, explaining how physical conditions shape the ecology |
| **Greater depth** | Analyse exceptions to expected climate-biome patterns (e.g., cold deserts, montane forests) and explain them using systems thinking |

This doesn't exist. My "all/most/some" success criteria are professional judgement, not graph-grounded.

#### 3. No Worked Examples or Model Geographical Analysis

Upper KS2 Geography demands extended geographical reasoning — pupils writing multi-paragraph explanations, interpreting data, constructing arguments from evidence. The graph provides no:
- Model answers at Y5 level
- Example geographical analyses
- Annotated exemplar responses
- Worked-through enquiry sequences

For the OS maps cluster (GE-KS2-D004-CL001), this is even more critical — pupils need to see a modelled grid reference reading, a modelled contour interpretation, a modelled route description.

#### 4. No Fieldwork Specification

The curriculum context mentions fieldwork extensively ("data collection through observation, sketch maps, plans, graphs and digital technologies"), and the concept skill links include "Fieldwork: data collection and presentation." But the graph provides no:
- Fieldwork activity specifications
- Data collection methods
- Equipment lists
- Safety considerations
- How to connect classroom learning to outdoor investigation

For Y5, fieldwork should be more independent and complex than Y3-4, but there's no progression in fieldwork complexity encoded in the graph.

#### 5. Extended Writing Scaffolds Missing

The Y5 learner profile says "Questions can require paragraph-length written responses" and "Use domain-specific register." But the graph provides no:
- Writing frames for geographical explanation
- Sentence starters for different text types (description, explanation, comparison, evaluation)
- Success criteria for geographical writing quality
- Model paragraphs at Y5 level

Geography is a writing-heavy subject at upper KS2. Without scaffolds, the platform will struggle to support the extended writing that Ofsted expects.

### Secondary Gaps

6. **No cross-subject CO_TEACHES links for Geography** — Science↔Geography (water cycle = states of matter), Maths↔Geography (coordinates, data interpretation) are obvious co-teaching opportunities but not encoded.

7. **Teaching time estimates missing** — every cluster shows "Estimated teaching time: None lessons (~None weeks)." For planning, I need to know if this is a 3-lesson sequence or a 6-lesson sequence.

8. **No GIS/digital mapping resources** — the curriculum context references GIS and digital mapping repeatedly, but no specific tool recommendations, datasets, or activity designs exist.

9. **Vehicle coverage gap for KS2** — the V5 review noted "~40% Geography statutory content missing" from vehicles. Even where vehicles exist (KS3), the coverage is patchy.

10. **Feedback examples are Maths-focused** — the Y5 feedback profile examples all use fraction comparisons. Geography-specific feedback examples would be far more useful for this lesson.

---

## Upper KS2 vs Lower KS2 — Does the Graph Scale Up?

### What scales well:
- Concept depth (Y5-appropriate content in descriptions)
- Misconception specificity (Y5-level errors documented)
- Thinking lens age-banding (KS2 prompts distinguish from KS1/KS3)
- Learner profile progression (Y5 profile correctly expects more independence than Y3)

### What doesn't scale:
- **Activity complexity** — the graph doesn't encode that Y5 pupils should do more independent enquiry, handle more data, or write more extended responses. The activities it *would* generate (if content vehicles existed) would be identical for Y3 and Y5.
- **Fieldwork progression** — no encoding of how fieldwork should develop from teacher-led (Y3) to semi-independent (Y5) to fully independent (Y6).
- **Data interpretation demand** — Y5 pupils should be reading climate graphs, comparing data tables, using GIS. The graph doesn't specify what data sources or analysis methods are age-appropriate.
- **Assessment sophistication** — Y5 Geography assessment should include data interpretation, map work, extended writing, and enquiry-based tasks. Without difficulty levels or worked examples, the platform can only assess recall.

---

## Top 5 Data Additions

### 1. KS2 Geography Content Vehicles (Priority: CRITICAL)
Create `case_study` vehicles for each KS2 Geography domain:
- **D001 (Locational Knowledge)**: "UK Counties and Cities" + "South America: Contrasting Region Study"
- **D002 (Place Knowledge)**: "Lake District vs. the Alps" + "Amazon Basin Place Study"
- **D003 (Human & Physical Geography)**: "The Water Cycle and the Mersey Drainage Basin" + "Tropical Rainforest Biome Study" + "UK Settlement Patterns"
- **D004 (Geographical Skills)**: "OS Map Skills: Local Area Investigation" + "Digital Mapping and GIS Project"

Each needs: `data_points`, `sources/perspectives` (like History vehicles), `assessment_guidance`, resource references.

### 2. DifficultyLevel Nodes for Geography Concepts
Extend the Y3 Maths pilot to all KS2 Geography concepts. Minimum 3 levels per concept:
- `developing` / `expected` / `greater_depth` (skip `entry` for Y5 if concepts are introduced earlier)
- Each with `example_task`, `example_response`, `common_errors`
- Critical for the climate/biomes and water cycle concepts where depth of explanation varies enormously

### 3. Worked Example / Model Response Nodes
New node type or property on ConceptCluster: `model_analysis` containing:
- A geographical enquiry question at expected standard
- A model Y5 response with annotated reasoning
- A common incomplete response with diagnostic notes
- For skills clusters (OS maps): step-by-step worked examples of the skill

### 4. Fieldwork Specification Property on Concepts
Add to skill-linked concepts (`DEVELOPS_SKILL -> Fieldwork`):
- `fieldwork_type`: observational, measurement, survey, transect
- `data_collection_methods`: tally, measurement, sketch map, photograph, interview
- `equipment_needed`: OS map, compass, clinometer, camera, tablet
- `y5_independence_level`: "semi-independent — teacher models first site, pupils replicate at second site"
- `safety_notes`: specific to the activity

### 5. Cross-Subject CO_TEACHES Links for Geography
Add curated links:
- `GE-KS2-C002` (Climate/Biomes) ↔ `SC-Y4-C0xx` (States of Matter — evaporation/condensation)
- `GE-KS2-C002` (Climate/Biomes) ↔ `SC-Y4-C0xx` (Living Things — habitats and adaptation)
- `GE-KS2-C001` (Latitude/Longitude) ↔ `MA-Y4-C0xx` (Coordinates in Maths)
- `GE-KS2-C003` (Water Cycle) ↔ `SC-Y5-C0xx` (Earth and Space — if applicable)
- `GE-KS2-C005` (OS Maps) ↔ `MA-Y5-C0xx` (Scale and proportion)

## Comparison with V5 Teacher Review Findings

The V5 review (2026-02-23) identified these gaps, and my Y5 experience confirms every one:

| V5 Finding | My Y5 Confirmation |
|-----------|-------------------|
| No worked examples | ❌ Confirmed — critical for upper KS2 geographical analysis |
| No difficulty sub-levels | ❌ Confirmed — can't differentiate assessment without them |
| ~40% Geography statutory content missing from vehicles | ❌ Confirmed — 0% KS2 Geography vehicles exist |
| Thinking Lens rationales age-inappropriate for KS1 | N/A (I'm Y5) — but the KS2 prompts worked well |
| Thin safety notes | ⚠️ Confirmed — fieldwork safety completely absent |

**My additions to V5 findings:**
- Fieldwork specification is a Geography-specific gap not fully captured by V5
- Cross-subject CO_TEACHES for Geography is missing (V5 focused on within-subject)
- Teaching time estimates are absent across all clusters
- GIS/digital mapping resources are referenced but never specified
- Extended writing scaffolds for Geography are entirely absent
- Feedback examples in the learner profile are subject-agnostic (all Maths fractions) — need Geography-specific examples

---

## Path to 8/10 for KS2 Geography

1. **Create 8-10 KS2 Geography content vehicles** across all 4 domains (estimated effort: medium)
2. **Add DifficultyLevel nodes** for all 6 KS2 Geography concepts (estimated effort: medium — use Y3 Maths as template)
3. **Add model responses** at expected/greater depth to each ConceptCluster (estimated effort: low-medium)
4. **Add fieldwork specifications** to skill-linked concepts (estimated effort: low)
5. **Add cross-subject CO_TEACHES** links to Science and Maths (estimated effort: low — 10-15 curated links)
6. **Add teaching time estimates** to all clusters (estimated effort: trivial)
7. **Add Geography-specific feedback examples** to learner profile or cluster context (estimated effort: low)

Items 1-2 would move the score from 5 to 7. Items 3-7 would push it to 8.

## Teaching Artefacts Needed

The team lead asked: what would I actually need to walk into my Y5 classroom and teach this lesson? What do I print, project, hand out, stick on the wall? Here's my top 5 in priority order, specific to Y5 Geography.

### 1. Knowledge Organiser (CRITICAL)

**What it is**: A single A3 sheet with everything a pupil needs to know about the topic — key vocabulary with definitions, labelled diagrams (water cycle, biome map), key facts, and the big question.

**Why it matters for Y5 Geography**: This is the single most impactful artefact in primary Geography teaching. It goes on the working wall at the start of the topic, pupils glue a copy into their books, and it becomes the reference point for every lesson. For climate zones and biomes, it would include:
- World biome map with climate zones labelled
- Water cycle diagram with all processes labelled
- Key vocabulary grid (28 terms from the graph — this data EXISTS)
- Key facts (latitude ranges for each climate zone, biome characteristics)
- The big question: "How do climate, biomes and the water cycle work as a system?"

**What the graph provides**: Vocabulary lists, concept descriptions, thinking lens key question. About 60% of the content for a knowledge organiser exists in the graph — but it's not assembled or formatted.

**What's missing**: Visual layout, diagrams, the actual map, and the curated selection of which facts matter most. A KS2 Geography content vehicle with `data_points` would close most of this gap.

**Could the platform generate this?** Partially. The vocabulary, key question, and concept summaries could be auto-populated. The diagrams and maps would need to be sourced or generated separately.

### 2. Differentiated Enquiry Worksheets (3 levels)

**What it is**: A set of 3 worksheets (support / core / extension) for the main enquiry activity, each with the same geographical content but different scaffolding and demand.

**Why it matters for Y5 Geography**: My class has a reading range from low Y4 to high Y6. The core enquiry task (interpreting climate data to classify biomes) needs to be accessible to all pupils but stretch the most able. In Geography, differentiation isn't about doing less — it's about the depth of analysis and the independence of the enquiry.

- **Support**: Climate zone table with most cells pre-filled, word bank provided, sentence starters for written responses
- **Core**: Partially completed table (faded worked example from graph pedagogy profile), key vocabulary available but no word bank, paragraph-length response expected
- **Extension**: Blank table, additional "exception" data (cold deserts, montane biomes), extended writing task requiring systems thinking ("If global temperatures rise by 2°C, predict which biome boundaries shift and why")

**What the graph provides**: The pedagogy profile gives scaffolding level (light_to_moderate), hint tiers (max 4), and the faded worked example principle. The concept misconceptions inform which distractors to build into the support version. But the actual worksheet content — the data, the tasks, the scaffolds — doesn't exist.

**What's missing**: DifficultyLevel nodes with `example_task` and `example_response` at each level would make this generatable. Without them, I'm designing all three levels from scratch.

**Could the platform generate this?** Yes, if DifficultyLevels existed for Geography. The Y3 Maths pilot (entry/developing/expected/greater_depth with example tasks) is exactly the right template. Apply it to Geography and these worksheets become auto-generatable.

### 3. Map and Data Resource Pack (printed or projected)

**What it is**: The geographical source materials pupils actually work with — OS map extracts, climate graphs, biome distribution maps, satellite images, photographs of different biomes.

**Why it matters for Y5 Geography**: Geography is a visual, data-rich subject. You cannot teach climate zones without a climate zone map. You cannot teach the water cycle without a diagram. You cannot teach OS map skills without an OS map. At Y5, pupils should be interpreting real data — temperature/rainfall graphs for different locations, comparing satellite imagery across seasons, reading contour lines on 1:25000 OS extracts.

For this specific lesson I need:
- World biome map (wall display size + pupil copies)
- Climate graphs for 4 contrasting locations (Manaus, Cairo, Liverpool, Tromsø)
- Water cycle system diagram (for labelling activity)
- 4 unlabelled biome photographs (for introduction challenge)
- Local OS map showing the Mersey drainage basin

**What the graph provides**: Nothing. Zero map resources, zero data, zero image references. The teaching guidance says "use world climate and biome maps" and "use photographs to study river landforms" but provides no actual resources.

**What's missing**: A `MapResource` or `DataResource` node type, or at minimum a `resource_refs` property on ContentVehicles, pointing to specific maps, datasets, and image collections. Even curated links to free resources (Digimap for Schools, Met Office climate data, OS OpenData) would be transformative.

**Could the platform generate this?** Not directly — maps and photographs are external resources. But the platform could curate and reference them. A content vehicle with `map_refs: ["OS Explorer OL7 — English Lakes SE"]` and `data_sources: ["Met Office Historic Station Data — Heathrow"]` would get me 80% of the way there.

### 4. Assessment Grid / Marking Rubric

**What it is**: A rubric for assessing the plenary extended writing task and the enquiry task, with clear criteria at developing/expected/greater depth levels, and example responses at each level.

**Why it matters for Y5 Geography**: Geography assessment at upper KS2 is notoriously inconsistent because the National Curriculum doesn't provide level descriptors for foundation subjects. Every school creates their own assessment criteria. A graph-grounded rubric — based on the concept descriptions, misconceptions, and difficulty levels — would be far more reliable than what most schools cobble together.

For the plenary writing task ("Explain why a tropical rainforest could not survive in the UK"):
- **Developing**: Names climate zones correctly but doesn't explain the causal link between latitude and climate
- **Expected**: Explains that the UK's temperate latitude means lower temperatures and less rainfall than tropical zones, so the vegetation is different
- **Greater depth**: Uses systems thinking to explain how latitude → solar angle → temperature → precipitation → vegetation type, and identifies that it's the COMBINATION of factors (not just temperature) that determines the biome

**What the graph provides**: Concept descriptions, misconceptions, and the thinking lens framework give me the CONTENT for assessment criteria. The feedback profile gives me the TONE ("analytical competence, not praise"). But there are no actual assessment rubrics, no example responses, no marking criteria.

**What's missing**: DifficultyLevel nodes would provide exactly this. The Y3 Maths pilot has `example_task`, `example_response`, `common_errors` — apply this to Geography and assessment grids become auto-generatable.

**Could the platform generate this?** Yes, with DifficultyLevels. The combination of concept description + misconception data + difficulty level example responses + thinking lens criteria would produce a strong rubric. This is one of the highest-value generation targets.

### 5. Fieldwork Planning Sheet (with risk assessment)

**What it is**: A one-page planning document for the local fieldwork extension — "What biome is Liverpool in?" — including learning objectives, equipment list, data collection method, safety considerations, and a pupil recording sheet.

**Why it matters for Y5 Geography**: Fieldwork is statutory at KS2. The curriculum says pupils should "use fieldwork to observe, measure, record and present the human and physical features in the local area using a range of methods." At Y5, fieldwork should be semi-independent: I model the first data collection point, then pupils replicate the method at subsequent sites. The planning sheet is what I hand to my TA and what goes to SLT for risk assessment approval.

For this lesson's fieldwork extension:
- **Location**: Nearest green space / park (deciduous woodland indicators)
- **Equipment**: Clipboard, recording sheet, camera/tablet, thermometer, rain gauge (if school has weather station)
- **Data collection**: Temperature reading, tree species identification (deciduous vs evergreen), ground cover estimation, sketch map of vegetation distribution
- **Safety**: Appropriate clothing, staying within boundaries, hand washing after outdoor work, adult:child ratios
- **Pupil recording sheet**: Pre-structured table with columns for each observation

**What the graph provides**: The `DEVELOPS_SKILL` link to "Fieldwork: data collection and presentation" confirms fieldwork is relevant. The teaching guidance says "Investigate local rivers or streams through fieldwork." That's it. No equipment, no methods, no safety, no recording templates.

**What's missing**: A `FieldworkActivity` node type (as I proposed in the main gap analysis) with activity_type, data_methods, equipment, safety_notes, and duration. This is Geography-specific infrastructure that would transform the subject's usability.

**Could the platform generate this?** Partially. If FieldworkActivity nodes existed with structured data, the platform could generate planning sheets and recording templates. Risk assessments would still need school-specific context (site, ratios, medical needs) but a template with standard Geography fieldwork risks would save significant time.

### Honourable Mentions (6-10)

6. **Vocabulary cards / word mat** — The graph has all 28 terms. Auto-generating a printable word mat with terms, definitions, and simple diagrams would be trivial and high-value. This is the lowest-hanging fruit.

7. **Presentation slides** — For the teacher-led instruction phase (Part A). The thinking lens question stems, vocabulary, and biome characteristics could populate slides. But slides need images, and the graph has none.

8. **Homework sheet** — A retrieval practice task for the following week, testing climate zone/biome knowledge and water cycle processes. The graph's spacing interval (3-14 days for Y5) directly informs when to set this.

9. **Working wall display materials** — Key vocabulary, the big question, biome images, the water cycle diagram. Most schools refresh working walls for each topic. The knowledge organiser (#1) serves as the base.

10. **Parent-facing topic summary** — A short note explaining what we're learning and how to support at home. The concept descriptions in the graph are detailed enough to inform this, but they're not written in parent-friendly language.

### The Gap Between "Lesson Plan" and "Ready to Teach"

With just the lesson plan from the graph, I would need approximately **3-4 hours of additional preparation** to create these artefacts myself. That's a typical Geography topic prep load for a conscientious teacher, but it's exactly the load this platform should be reducing.

If the graph had KS2 Geography content vehicles + DifficultyLevels, the platform could auto-generate artefacts 1, 2, 4, and 6 almost entirely, and provide substantial scaffolding for 3 and 5. That would cut my prep time to **30-45 minutes** — checking and customising generated materials rather than creating from scratch. That's the difference between a useful tool and a transformative one.
