**Teacher:** Ms. Brennan (Y3, Leeds)
**Cluster:** MA-Y3-D004-CL001 (introduction, keystone)
**Date:** Graph data review, February 2026
**Duration:** 60 minutes

## 1. Learning Objectives ✅

**Curriculum objectives addressed (all statutory):**
- MA-Y3-O014: Count up and down in tenths; recognise that tenths arise from dividing an object into 10 equal parts and in dividing one-digit numbers or quantities by 10
- MA-Y3-O015: Recognise, find and write fractions of a discrete set of objects: unit fractions and non-unit fractions with small denominators
- MA-Y3-O016: Recognise and use fractions as numbers: unit fractions and non-unit fractions with small denominators

**Concepts covered (3):**
1. MA-Y3-C024: Tenths as fractions and in place value (weight 2)
2. MA-Y3-C025: Unit fractions with small denominators (weight 3, KEYSTONE)
3. MA-Y3-C026: Non-unit fractions with small denominators (weight 3)

**By the end of this lesson, pupils will:**
- Understand that a fraction represents equal parts of a whole
- Know that the denominator tells us how many equal parts and the numerator tells us how many parts we are counting
- Find unit fractions (1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/8, 1/10) of sets of objects by equal sharing
- Recognise that tenths arise from dividing into 10 equal parts
- Find non-unit fractions of sets by finding the unit fraction first, then multiplying

**Data source:** Objectives from graph (MA-Y3-O014, O015, O016). Concept descriptions provided the "by the end" statements. DifficultyLevel "expected" tier descriptions confirmed the target standard.

## 2. Success Criteria ⚠️

**All pupils (Entry/Developing):**
- I can share objects equally into groups to find a unit fraction (e.g. 1/3 of 12 counters)
- I can fold a paper strip into 10 equal parts and identify one tenth
- I can place unit fractions on a number line between 0 and 1

**Most pupils (Expected):**
- I can compare unit fractions and explain that larger denominators mean smaller parts
- I can find non-unit fractions of quantities using the divide-then-multiply method (e.g. 3/4 of 20)
- I can count in tenths on a number line, including beyond 1 whole

**Some pupils (Greater Depth):**
- I can connect tenths to measurement contexts (e.g. 1/10 of a metre = 10 cm)
- I can find a non-unit fraction and reason about what fraction remains (e.g. "Priya eats 3/8 of 24 sweets — how many are left?")

**Data source:** Success criteria were derived directly from DifficultyLevel descriptions and example tasks. The entry/developing/expected/greater depth labels mapped perfectly to the differentiated success criteria tiers. I added the "I can" framing and chose representative examples from the DL data. This is the first section where DifficultyLevels really proved their worth — they essentially wrote the success criteria for me.

## 3. Prior Knowledge Required ⚠️

**From Y2 (Fractions as 'fractions of': 1/3, 1/4, 2/4, 3/4 — concept MA-Y2-C012):**
- Understanding of halves and quarters as equal parts of a shape or set
- Practical experience of sharing into 2 and 4 equal groups
- Recognition that 2/4 and 1/2 are the same amount (early equivalence)

**From Y2 (Time — MA-Y2-C016):**
- Quarter past/quarter to — incidental fraction language in context

**Within-cluster prerequisite chain (from graph):**
- C025 (unit fractions) is prerequisite for C026 (non-unit fractions) — teach unit fractions first

**Cross-domain link (from graph CO_TEACHES):**
- MA-Y3-C007 (Place value in three-digit numbers) connects to MA-Y3-C024 (Tenths) — "Place value in three-digit numbers extends rightward to tenths"

**Starter activity — diagnostic check (2 minutes):**
"Show me half of this chocolate bar" (fold paper in half). "Show me a quarter." "How many quarters make a whole?" This checks Y2 secure knowledge before building on it.

**Data source:** The graph gave me the within-cluster prerequisite (C025 → C026), the cross-domain CO_TEACHES link to place value, and the Y2 fraction concept name. However, the prerequisite chain from Y2 into Y3 was not explicitly modelled — I had to look up Y2 concepts separately and infer the connection. The curriculum context paragraph (from the domain) helped: "pupils extend their understanding of fractions significantly beyond the simple halves and quarters of KS1."

## 4. Lesson Structure with Timings ⚠️

The graph's pedagogy profile specifies a session sequence of: **challenge_problem → guided_exploration → worked_example → independent_practice → retrieval_practice** with session length 12-20 minutes. For a full 60-minute class lesson I've expanded this structure across three phases, keeping the sequence within each.

### Introduction (10 minutes)

**0-2 min: Diagnostic starter**
"Fold your paper strip in half. Now quarters. How many quarters in a whole?" Quick check of Y2 knowledge. Hands up / show me.

**2-5 min: Challenge problem (productive failure)**
Per the pedagogy profile: "Start with a challenge problem — do not explain first."

Give each table a bag of 15 counters and a card: "Find 1/3 of these counters."
Do NOT explain. Let them attempt for 2-3 minutes. Circulate and observe strategies. Collect responses on the board: "Table 1 got 5. Table 2 got 5. Table 3 got 3. Who's right? How do you know?"

**5-10 min: Connect to prior knowledge**
"You already know halves and quarters from Year 2. Today we're going deeper — thirds, fifths, eighths, tenths. And we're going to find out what happens when we take MORE than one part."

Introduce the fraction wall (display). Point: "Look — the more parts you split into, the smaller each part gets. 1/2 is bigger than 1/3. 1/3 is bigger than 1/4."

### Main Activity (35 minutes)

**Phase 1: Unit fractions — concrete and pictorial (12 min)**

**Worked example** (guided, using fraction visualiser / physical fraction circles):
"I want to find 1/5 of 20 counters."
Step 1: "The denominator is 5, so I need 5 equal groups."
Step 2: Share 20 counters into 5 groups (children do this physically at tables)
Step 3: "Each group has 4 counters. So 1/5 of 20 = 4."

**Guided practice** (tables, with manipulatives):
- Find 1/3 of 12 counters [Entry level task from DL data]
- Find 1/4 of 16 counters
- Find 1/5 of 20 [Developing level]
- Place 1/5 on a number line between 0 and 1 [Developing level]

Teaching point (from misconceptions data): "Watch out — some people think 1/8 is bigger than 1/3 because 8 is bigger than 3. But look at the fraction wall — the more pieces, the SMALLER each piece is."

**Phase 2: Tenths — bridge to place value (8 min)**

**Concrete activity** (metre sticks on tables):
"Your metre stick is already divided into 10 equal parts. Each part is 10 cm."
"What fraction of the whole stick is one part?" (1/10)
"Colour one part. What fraction have you coloured?" [Entry level DL task]

"Now count in tenths on the number line: 0/10, 1/10, 2/10... What happens when we get to 10/10?" (= 1 whole!) [Developing level DL task]

"Count from 8/10 to 14/10. What do we call 10/10?" [Expected level DL task]

Cross-domain connection (from CO_TEACHES data): "Remember our place value work? Hundreds, tens, ones — tenths come NEXT. Dividing by 10 takes us one step to the right."

**Phase 3: Non-unit fractions — the multiply step (15 min)**

**Worked example** (I do, we do, you do):
"Find 3/4 of 20."
Step 1: "First, find the unit fraction. 1/4 of 20 = 20 ÷ 4 = 5."
Step 2: "The numerator is 3, so we need 3 of those groups. 3 x 5 = 15."
Step 3: "So 3/4 of 20 = 15."

Show on a fraction bar (divide into 4, shade 3 parts). [Developing level DL task]

**Independent practice** (graduated — see Section 11 for full question set):
- Find 2/5 of 15 counters — first find 1/5, then take 2 groups [Entry level]
- Find 3/4 of 20 — show on a fraction bar [Developing level]
- Find 5/8 of 40 — where would 5/8 sit on a number line? [Expected level]

**Greater depth challenge** (for rapid finishers):
"There are 24 sweets. Priya eats 3/8 of them. How many are left? What fraction is left?" [Greater depth DL task]

### Plenary (15 minutes)

**0-5 min: Retrieval practice with interleaving**
Per pedagogy profile: "Follow with 3-4 retrieval practice questions that mix this concept with previously mastered material."

Quick-fire questions mixing fractions with previously learned content:
1. What is 1/4 of 24? (fractions — today)
2. What is 347 + 265? (column addition — previous topic)
3. Put in order: 1/2, 1/8, 1/4, 1/3 (unit fraction comparison — today)
4. What is 3 x 8? (times tables — previous topic)

**5-10 min: Pattern discovery / I Notice, I Wonder**
Display three fraction bars: 1/3 of 12 = 4, 2/3 of 12 = 8, 3/3 of 12 = 12.
"What do you notice? What do you wonder?"
Collect observations. Do NOT correct during discovery phase (per interaction type guidance: "do NOT correct or evaluate observations during discovery").

**10-15 min: Key learning and exit ticket**
"Today we learned that fractions are equal parts. The bottom number tells us how many parts, the top number tells us how many we're counting. And to find a fraction of an amount, we divide first, then multiply."

Exit ticket (on mini whiteboard): "Find 2/3 of 18. Show your working."

**Data source:** The pedagogy profile session sequence (challenge → guided exploration → worked example → independent practice → retrieval) structured the lesson phases directly. Session length guidance (12-20 min) is for digital sessions; I extended to 60 min for a classroom lesson — the graph doesn't model whole-class lesson structure. The productive failure research citations (Sinha & Kapur 2021, d=0.36-0.58) justified the challenge-first approach. Interleaving guidance (Bjork 2011, d=0.42) structured the plenary.

---

## 5. Key Vocabulary with Definitions ✅

All vocabulary sourced directly from graph concept nodes (`key_vocabulary` property):

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **fraction** | A number that represents equal parts of a whole |
| **numerator** | The top number — tells us how many parts we are counting |
| **denominator** | The bottom number — tells us how many equal parts the whole is divided into |
| **unit fraction** | A fraction with 1 as the numerator (e.g. 1/2, 1/3, 1/4) |
| **non-unit fraction** | A fraction with a numerator greater than 1 (e.g. 2/3, 3/4) |
| **tenth** | One of 10 equal parts; written as 1/10 |
| **equal parts** | Parts that are all the same size |
| **fraction wall** | A diagram showing fractions of a whole as bars of different lengths |
| **number line** | A line marked with numbers at equal intervals, used to show fraction positions |
| **divide by ten** | Splitting into 10 equal groups — gives tenths |

**Data source:** Key vocabulary lists on each concept node. The graph gave terms but not child-friendly definitions — I wrote the definitions column myself using the concept descriptions as a source.

---

## 6. Resources and Materials Needed ⚠️

**Physical manipulatives:**
- Counters (bags of 20-30 per table)
- Fraction circles (sets per table)
- Fraction wall display (large, for front of class)
- Metre sticks (1 per table, marked in cm)
- Paper strips for folding
- Mini whiteboards and pens

**Digital tools available (from interaction types in graph):**
- Fraction Visualiser (Bar / Pizza / Set Model) — `fraction_visualizer`
- Number Line — Drag Marker — `number_line_scrubber`
- Place Value Blocks (Dienes / Base-10) — `place_value_blocks`

**Printed resources:**
- Fraction bar worksheets (blank bars divided into halves, thirds, quarters, fifths, eighths, tenths)
- Exit ticket slips
- Greater depth challenge cards

**Data source:** The teaching guidance on each concept node specified manipulatives (metre stick, fraction circles, fraction strips, fraction wall). The interaction types list confirmed digital tool availability (fraction_visualizer, number_line_scrubber). However, the graph does not provide printable worksheet templates, slide decks, or structured resource lists — I assembled the physical resources list from the teaching guidance text.

## 7. Differentiation (Support and Extension) ✅

This is where the DifficultyLevel data transforms lesson planning. Each concept has 3-4 grounded tiers with specific tasks:

### Support (Entry → Developing)

**Concept: Unit fractions (C025)**
- Entry task: "Find 1/3 of 12 counters by sharing them equally into 3 groups" — purely concrete, manipulatives essential
- Developing task: "Find 1/5 of 20. Place 1/5 on a number line between 0 and 1" — moving to pictorial

**Concept: Tenths (C024)**
- Entry task: "Fold a paper strip into 10 equal parts. Colour 1 part. What fraction have you coloured?" — concrete discovery
- Developing task: "Count in tenths from 0 to 1 on a number line. What is 7/10? Where does it go?" — structured counting

**Concept: Non-unit fractions (C026)**
- Entry task: "Find 2/5 of 15 counters. First find 1/5, then take 2 groups" — scaffolded two-step with concrete materials
- Developing task: "Find 3/4 of 20. Show this on a fraction bar" — transitioning to pictorial

**Additional support strategies:**
- Pre-teach vocabulary (fraction, numerator, denominator) with physical fraction circles before the lesson
- Paired working with a more confident partner during guided practice
- Sentence stems: "The denominator is ___, so I need ___ equal groups."
- 3-tier hint system (from pedagogy profile): Tier 1: "What do you already know about this?" → Tier 2: "Remember when we found halves by sharing into 2 groups?" → Tier 3: "The first step is to share the counters into [denominator] equal groups."

### Extension (Expected → Greater Depth)

**Concept: Unit fractions (C025)**
- Expected task: "Put these fractions in order from smallest to largest: 1/2, 1/8, 1/4, 1/3" — abstract comparison and ordering

**Concept: Tenths (C024)**
- Expected task: "What is 3 divided by 10? Count in tenths from 8/10 to 14/10" — beyond one whole
- Greater depth task: "A metre stick is divided into 10 equal parts. How long is each part in centimetres? Is 1/10 of a metre greater or less than 1/4 of a metre? Explain." — cross-concept reasoning

**Concept: Non-unit fractions (C026)**
- Expected task: "Find 5/8 of 40. Where would 5/8 sit on a number line between 0 and 1?" — abstract with number line placement
- Greater depth task: "There are 24 sweets. Priya eats 3/8 of them. How many are left? What fraction is left?" — multi-step reasoning with remainder

**Data source:** This entire section was built directly from DifficultyLevel nodes. Every task above is quoted verbatim from graph data. The 4-tier structure (entry → developing → expected → greater depth) mapped perfectly to differentiation bands. This is a genuine step change from planning without DL data — I did not have to invent a single differentiation task.

## 8. Assessment Opportunities ⚠️

**Formative assessment points:**
1. **Diagnostic starter** (0-2 min): Can pupils partition into halves and quarters? (checks Y2 prerequisite)
2. **Challenge problem response** (2-5 min): How do pupils approach "find 1/3 of 15"? Watch for equal-sharing vs random distribution
3. **Guided practice** (Phase 1): Are pupils sharing into equal groups consistently? Can they articulate "the denominator tells me how many groups"?
4. **Metre stick activity** (Phase 2): Can pupils identify 1/10? Can they count beyond 10/10?
5. **Independent practice** (Phase 3): Are pupils finding the unit fraction first before multiplying? (the key procedural step)
6. **Exit ticket**: "Find 2/3 of 18. Show your working." — checks the full divide-then-multiply procedure

**Content domain codes (from assessment layer):**
- 3F1: Recognise, find, write, name and count fractions → C025, C026
- 3F1a: Recognise, find, write, name and count fractions → C025 (unit fractions)
- 3F1b: Recognise, find, write, name and count fractions → C026 (non-unit fractions)
- 3F1c: Recognise, find, write, name and count fractions → C024 (tenths)

**Mastery threshold (from pedagogy profile):** 5 correct in 7 days (80%) — this is a digital session metric, not directly applicable to a single lesson, but useful for planning follow-up spacing.

**Data source:** The assessment layer gave me the content domain codes — extremely useful for knowing what will be formally tested. The mastery threshold and spacing interval (2-7 days) came from the pedagogy profile. The formative assessment points themselves were my professional judgment, informed by the misconceptions data and DifficultyLevel progression — the graph doesn't model in-lesson assessment moments.

## 9. Common Misconceptions to Address ✅

All misconceptions sourced directly from concept nodes:

| Misconception | Concept | How to Address |
|---|---|---|
| "1/8 is bigger than 1/3 because 8 is bigger than 3" | C025 (Unit fractions) | Use the fraction wall: "Look — the more pieces you cut, the smaller each piece gets. Would you rather have 1/3 of a pizza or 1/8 of the same pizza?" |
| Accepting non-equal partitions as valid fractions | C025 (Unit fractions) | Show a circle with unequal segments: "Is this divided into thirds? Are the parts equal? If they're not equal, they're not fair shares — and fractions must be fair shares." |
| "1/10 is a big fraction because 10 is a big number" | C024 (Tenths) | Metre stick demonstration: "This whole stick is split into 10 parts. Each part is tiny — just 10 cm. Now split it in half — each part is 50 cm. Which is bigger, 1/2 or 1/10?" |
| Counting tenths beyond one whole incorrectly (e.g. "eleven tenths" instead of "one whole and one tenth") | C024 (Tenths) | Number line counting: mark beyond 10/10 and label 10/10 = 1 whole. "After 10/10 we start the next whole. 11/10 is one whole and one tenth." |
| Finding the unit fraction but forgetting to multiply by the numerator | C026 (Non-unit fractions) | Worked example emphasis: "Finding 3/4 of 20. Step 1 gives us 5 — but that's only ONE quarter. We need THREE quarters. 3 x 5 = 15." |
| Treating numerator and denominator as independent whole numbers | C026 (Non-unit fractions) | Return to the concrete: "3/4 doesn't mean 3 and 4 separately. It means: cut into 4 equal parts, take 3 of them. Let's do it with counters." |

**Data source:** Every misconception above is from the graph's `common_misconceptions` property on the concept nodes. The "how to address" strategies are my teaching approaches, informed by the teaching guidance text. The graph gives excellent misconception identification but does not provide explicit remediation strategies — I wrote those.

---

## 10. Worked Examples ⚠️

### Worked Example 1: Finding a unit fraction of a set

**"Find 1/4 of 16 counters."**

Step 1: Read the fraction. "The denominator is 4. That means 4 equal groups."
Step 2: Share the counters equally. [Physically share 16 counters into 4 groups]
Step 3: Count one group. "Each group has 4 counters."
Step 4: Write the answer. "1/4 of 16 = 4."

Check: "4 groups of 4 = 16. Yes, that uses all the counters."

### Worked Example 2: Counting in tenths on a number line

**"Count in tenths from 0 to 14/10. What is 10/10?"**

Step 1: Draw a number line from 0 to 2.
Step 2: Mark 10 equal jumps between 0 and 1. Label: 1/10, 2/10, 3/10... 10/10.
Step 3: "10/10 = 1 whole. We've used all 10 parts."
Step 4: Keep counting: 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, 14/10. "14/10 is one whole and four tenths."

### Worked Example 3: Finding a non-unit fraction of a quantity

**"Find 3/4 of 20."**

Step 1: "First, find the unit fraction. 1/4 of 20."
Step 2: "Divide: 20 ÷ 4 = 5. So 1/4 of 20 = 5."
Step 3: "Now multiply by the numerator. We need 3 quarters. 3 x 5 = 15."
Step 4: "So 3/4 of 20 = 15."

Show on a fraction bar: [Bar divided into 4, three parts shaded, each part labelled 5]

Check: "Is 15 less than 20? Yes — 3/4 should be less than a whole, so that makes sense."

**Data source:** The DifficultyLevel `example_task` and `example_response` properties provided the problems and target answers, but NOT step-by-step working. The teaching guidance text informed the procedural steps (e.g. "Build from unit fractions: 'We know 1/4 of 20 = 5, so 3/4 of 20 = 3 x 5 = 15'"). I constructed the full worked examples by combining DL task data with teaching guidance text. The graph does not contain structured worked examples with step-by-step solutions — this is a significant gap.

## 11. Practice Questions (Graduated Difficulty) ✅

All questions below are sourced from or closely adapted from DifficultyLevel `example_task` data:

### Entry (concrete, with manipulatives)

1. Fold a paper strip into 10 equal parts. Colour 1 part. What fraction have you coloured? *(C024 — Entry)*
2. Find 1/3 of 12 counters by sharing them equally into 3 groups. *(C025 — Entry)*
3. Find 1/4 of 8 counters by sharing them equally into 4 groups. *(adapted from C025 — Entry)*
4. Find 2/5 of 15 counters. First find 1/5, then take 2 groups. *(C026 — Entry)*

### Developing (pictorial, with fraction bars/number lines)

5. Count in tenths from 0 to 1 on a number line. What is 7/10? Where does it go? *(C024 — Developing)*
6. Find 1/5 of 20. Place 1/5 on a number line between 0 and 1. *(C025 — Developing)*
7. Find 3/4 of 20. Show this on a fraction bar. *(C026 — Developing)*
8. Find 2/3 of 18. Show this on a fraction bar. *(adapted from C026 — Developing)*

### Expected (abstract, with reasoning)

9. What is 3 divided by 10? Count in tenths from 8/10 to 14/10. *(C024 — Expected)*
10. Put these fractions in order from smallest to largest: 1/2, 1/8, 1/4, 1/3. *(C025 — Expected)*
11. Find 5/8 of 40. Where would 5/8 sit on a number line between 0 and 1? *(C026 — Expected)*

### Greater Depth (reasoning, multi-step)

12. A metre stick is divided into 10 equal parts. How long is each part in centimetres? Is 1/10 of a metre greater or less than 1/4 of a metre? Explain. *(C024 — Greater Depth)*
13. There are 24 sweets. Priya eats 3/8 of them. How many are left? What fraction is left? *(C026 — Greater Depth)*
14. Find 3/5 of 30. Find 2/5 of 30. Add your answers together. What do you get? Why? *(adapted — Greater Depth)*

**Data source:** Questions 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 are verbatim from DifficultyLevel `example_task` properties. Questions 3, 4, 8, 14 are closely adapted from DL patterns with changed numbers. The DL data provided excellent graduated practice — this is the strongest section in terms of data sufficiency.

---

## 12. Cross-Curricular Links ⚠️

**From graph data:**
- **Place Value** (MA-Y3-C007, cross-domain CO_TEACHES): "Place value in three-digit numbers extends rightward to tenths." Tenths connect to the place value column: hundreds → tens → ones → tenths. This is explicitly flagged in the curriculum context.

**From epistemic skills layer:**
- MR-KS2-002: Mathematical reasoning and justification — "Why is 1/3 bigger than 1/4? Convince me."
- MR-KS2-004: Generalisation from patterns — "What pattern do you notice about unit fractions as the denominator gets bigger?"
- MR-KS2-005: Estimation, checking and reasonableness — "Is 3/4 of 20 likely to be more or less than 10? How do you know before calculating?"

**Inferred (not in graph):**
- **Science** (measurement): Measuring in tenths of a metre, connecting to standard units
- **Cooking/DT**: Fractions of ingredients (1/4 cup, 2/3 of a recipe)
- **PE**: Dividing the class into equal groups for team games
- **Music**: Note values as fractions (whole, half, quarter notes)

**Data source:** The CO_TEACHES cross-domain link to place value was directly from the graph. The epistemic skills (Mathematical Reasoning KS2) were available. Cross-curricular links to other subjects (Science, DT, Music) were my own additions — the graph does not model cross-subject links for Maths at concept level.
