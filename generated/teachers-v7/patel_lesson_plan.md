# Lesson Plan: Apply Prefixes, Suffixes and Doubling Rules to Spell Derived Words

**Cluster:** `EN-Y3-D004-CL001` (introduction) — Writing: Transcription (Spelling)
**Teacher:** Ms. Patel, Y3 Class Teacher & English Lead
**Duration:** 60 minutes
**Thinking Lens:** Patterns (recommended by graph)

---

## 1. Learning Objectives ✅

**Graph provides clear, curriculum-aligned objectives for both concepts in this cluster.**

By the end of this lesson, pupils will:
- Apply spelling rules for adding common prefixes (un-, dis-, mis-, re-) to root words, understanding that the root word spelling does not change
- Apply rules for adding vowel suffixes (-ing, -ed, -er, -est) to polysyllabic words, doubling the final consonant when the last syllable is stressed (e.g., begin → beginning) and not doubling when unstressed (e.g., garden → gardening)

**National Curriculum reference:** Y3 Spelling — Appendix 1 (prefixes/suffixes, consonant doubling)
**Concepts:** EN-Y3-C034 (Prefixes and suffixes spelling rules) + EN-Y3-C035 (Suffix doubling rules for polysyllabic words) — linked via CO_TEACHES

**Graph assessment:** The graph correctly identifies these two concepts as co-teachable (C035 lists C034 in co_teach_hints), and both carry teaching_weight 3, indicating substantive teaching time needed. The cluster rationale is accurate — these are the two morphological spelling rules introduced in Y3.

## 2. Success Criteria ⚠️

**Graph provides concept definitions and misconceptions but no explicit success criteria. I'm generating these from the teaching guidance and key vocabulary.**

- I can add the prefix un-, dis-, mis- or re- to a root word without changing the root word spelling
- I can explain what the prefix does to the meaning (e.g., dis- means "not" or "opposite")
- I can decide whether to double the final consonant before adding -ing or -ed to a longer word
- I can explain WHY I doubled or didn't double (using the word "stress" / "beat")

**Graph assessment:** The teaching guidance for both concepts gives enough detail to reverse-engineer success criteria, but an AI agent would need to synthesise these — the graph does not offer them pre-formed. For a platform generating lessons automatically, this is a gap.

## 3. Prior Knowledge Required (KS1→KS2 Transition) ✅

**The graph's prerequisite chains are genuinely useful here.**

### Direct prerequisites (from graph):
- **EN-KS1-C031: Contractions** — children need to understand that words can be modified/shortened (apostrophe knowledge)
- **EN-KS1-C032: Possessive apostrophes (singular)** — understanding that punctuation marks can change meaning

### Implicit prerequisites I'd expect (not explicitly linked in graph):
- **EN-KS1-C027: Suffixes** — KS1 suffixes (-s, -es, -ing, -ed, -er, -est with single-syllable words)
- **EN-KS1-C028: Prefixes** — KS1 prefix knowledge (un-)
- **EN-KS1-C029: Root words** — understanding that words have a base form
- **EN-KS1-C025: Spelling using phonemes** — phonemic segmentation for spelling

**Graph assessment:** The prerequisite chain from KS1 is partially correct but INCOMPLETE for this specific cluster. The graph links to contractions and possessive apostrophes as prerequisites — these are from the same KS1 domain (D004 - Spelling) but are not the most relevant prerequisites for prefix/suffix work. The critical prior knowledge is KS1 suffixes (C027), prefixes (C028), and root words (C029). These exist as KS1 concepts but are NOT linked as prerequisites of EN-Y3-C034 or EN-Y3-C035. This is a meaningful gap — a Y3 teacher needs to know that children should already be able to add -s, -es, -ing, -ed to single-syllable words before tackling polysyllabic doubling rules.

### What I'd check at start of lesson:
- Can children identify the root word in "unhappy", "redo", "jumping"?
- Can they add -ing to "play" and "hop" correctly? (KS1 single-syllable doubling)
- Do they know what a prefix and suffix are?

## 4. Lesson Structure with Timings ⚠️

**Graph provides the pedagogy profile session sequence (challenge_problem → guided_exploration → worked_example → independent_practice → retrieval_practice) but times are for digital sessions (12–20 mins). I'm adapting to a 60-minute classroom lesson.**

### Introduction — 10 minutes

**Challenge Problem (Productive Failure — graph recommends this)**
- Display on the board: _"Add -ing to these words: play, hop, garden, begin, forget"_
- Children attempt independently on whiteboards (2–3 minutes)
- Do NOT correct yet — collect responses and display a range of attempts
- "I can see some interesting patterns in your answers. Let's investigate."

**Pattern Discovery (graph's recommended interaction type)**
- Display the correctly spelled words: playing, hopping, gardening, beginning, forgetting
- "I Notice / I Wonder" — children share observations
- Accept all observations without correcting: "That's interesting, what else do you notice?"
- Guide towards: "Some words doubled the last letter and some didn't. Why?"

### Main Activity — 35 minutes

**Part A: Prefix Rules (15 minutes) — Guided Exploration + Worked Example**

1. **Worked Example** (graph: concept EN-Y3-C034 teaching guidance)
   - Write "happy" on the board. Add prefix "un-" → "unhappy"
   - Key rule: "When we add a prefix, the root word spelling NEVER changes"
   - Model with: dis + appear = disappear (NOT "dissappear")
   - Model with: mis + spell = misspell (the double 's' is correct because mis- ends in s and spell starts with s)
   - Model with: re + do = redo, re + write = rewrite

2. **Drag to Categorise Activity** (graph's recommended interaction type — adapted for classroom)
   - Word cards on tables: disappoint, misunderstand, redo, unhappy, submarine, autograph, rewrite, disagree, misbehave, supermarket
   - Sort into prefix groups: un- / dis- / mis- / re- / super- / sub- / auto-
   - Check: "Did the root word change when we added the prefix?" (No — ever)

3. **Common Misconception Check** (graph provides these explicitly):
   - Show "dissappoint" vs "disappoint" — which is correct? Why?
   - The graph correctly identifies that children change root word spelling when adding prefixes

**Part B: Suffix Doubling Rule (15 minutes) — Guided Exploration + Worked Example**

1. **Worked Example** (graph: concept EN-Y3-C035 teaching guidance)
   - Two columns: "Double" and "Don't Double"
   - begin → beginning ✓ (stress on -GIN, ends consonant after single vowel)
   - forget → forgetting ✓ (stress on -GET)
   - garden → gardening ✗ (stress on GAR-, not on -den)
   - visit → visiting ✗ (stress on VIS-, not on -it)

2. **Clapping Strategy** (NOT from graph — I'm adding this):
   - Clap the syllables. Which syllable sounds strongest?
   - "be-GIN" — the end sounds strongest → double
   - "GAR-den" — the start sounds strongest → don't double
   - Children practise with: prefer, limit, enter, occur, open, commit

3. **Common Misconception Check** (from graph):
   - Show "enterring" — is this right? Clap "EN-ter" — stress on EN, so no doubling
   - Show "begining" — is this right? Clap "be-GIN" — stress on GIN, so double

**Part C: Independent Practice (5 minutes)**

- Mixed worksheet: "Add the prefix or suffix to each word. Write the new word."
  1. un + tidy = _______
  2. forget + ing = _______
  3. dis + agree = _______
  4. garden + er = _______
  5. mis + behave = _______
  6. begin + er = _______

### Plenary — 15 minutes

**Retrieval Practice with Interleaving** (graph pedagogy profile: spacing + interleaving)

1. **Matching Pairs** (graph's recommended interaction type — adapted for classroom)
   - Cards face down: match the root word to its correctly spelled derived form
   - Pairs: begin/beginning, forget/forgetting, garden/gardening, disappear/disappoint (trick — both dis- words), happy/unhappy

2. **Pattern Statement** (aligned with Patterns thinking lens)
   - "What rule connects all the prefix examples? What rule connects the doubling examples?"
   - Children articulate: "Prefixes don't change the root word" and "We double when the stress is at the end"

3. **Exit Ticket** — 3 quick questions:
   - Add dis- to "appear": ________
   - Add -ing to "prefer": ________
   - Add -ing to "open": ________

**Assessment:** Use graph feedback guidance — "You spotted the pattern — the stress was on the last syllable, so you doubled the consonant. That's a really useful rule to remember." NOT "Well done!" or "Amazing!"

## 5. Key Vocabulary with Definitions ✅

**Graph provides key vocabulary lists for both concepts.**

| Term | Definition | Source |
|------|-----------|--------|
| **prefix** | A letter group added to the START of a word to change its meaning | EN-Y3-C034 |
| **suffix** | A letter group added to the END of a word to change its meaning or job | EN-Y3-C034 |
| **root word** | The base word before any prefix or suffix is added | EN-Y3-C034 |
| **spelling rule** | A pattern that tells us how to spell words correctly | EN-Y3-C034 |
| **double** | To write a consonant letter twice (e.g., the 'n' in 'beginning') | EN-Y3-C035 |
| **consonant** | A letter that is not a vowel (b, c, d, f, g...) | EN-Y3-C035 |
| **stressed syllable** | The syllable in a word that sounds strongest when you say it | EN-Y3-C035 |
| **polysyllabic** | A word with more than one syllable | EN-Y3-C035 |

**Graph assessment:** Vocabulary lists are comprehensive and appropriate. The term "polysyllabic" is included, which is correct for the National Curriculum but I'd introduce it carefully at Y3 — "a long word with more than one beat." The graph does not flag register/accessibility issues with vocabulary terms.

## 6. Resources and Materials Needed ❌

**Graph provides NO resources, materials, or text recommendations.**

I would need:
- Prefix word cards (un-, dis-, mis-, re-, super-, sub-, auto-) — **not provided**
- Root word cards for sorting activity — **not provided**
- Whiteboards and pens for challenge problem — **not provided**
- Worksheet for independent practice — **not provided**
- Matching pairs cards for plenary — **not provided**
- Model sentences on display for worked examples — **not provided**
- No content vehicle exists for Y3 English spelling — **significant gap**

**Graph assessment:** The graph describes WHAT to teach but provides zero concrete teaching resources. No word lists, no model sentences, no card templates. The content vehicles layer has 8 vehicles for Y4 English (text studies) but none for Y3 at all. For a spelling lesson, I'd want at minimum: a curated word list for each prefix/suffix rule, model sentences showing the words in context, and a set of common error examples.

## 7. Differentiation (Support + Extension) ⚠️

**Graph provides scaffolding level (moderate_to_high) and hint tiers (max 3) but no specific differentiation strategies.**

### Support (working towards expected):
- Focus on prefixes only (un-, dis-, re-) — leave polysyllabic doubling for next lesson
- Provide root word cards with the prefix already written as a separate card to physically attach
- Use only 2-syllable words for doubling practice (begin, forget) — avoid 3-syllable words
- Scaffold: "Say the word. Clap the beats. Which beat is loudest? Is it at the end?"

### Extension (greater depth):
- Apply doubling rule to less common words: occur, commit, permit, refer, transfer
- Investigate: why does "prefer" → "preferred" but "preference"? (stress shifts — advanced)
- Challenge: "Can you find a word where adding a prefix DOES create a double letter that looks wrong but is right?" (e.g., misspell, overrate, unnecessary)

### SEND considerations:
- Provide word mats with prefix meanings
- Use colour-coding: root word in black, prefix in blue, suffix in red
- For children with working memory difficulties: one rule at a time, physical word-building with magnetic letters

**Graph assessment:** The scaffolding_level: moderate_to_high is correct for Y3 but gives no English-specific differentiation guidance. The difficulty levels layer (which would provide entry/developing/expected/greater_depth tiers) has NOT been created for Y3 English — it's only piloted for Y3 Maths. This is a significant gap. The graph has no concept of "working towards" vs "greater depth" for any English concept.

## 8. Assessment Opportunities ⚠️

**Graph provides misconception information (excellent) and feedback guidance, but no formal assessment frameworks.**

### Formative assessment points:
1. **Challenge problem** (opening) — reveals existing knowledge of prefix/suffix rules from KS1
2. **Sorting activity** — can children identify prefix boundaries correctly?
3. **Clapping strategy** — can children identify stressed syllables?
4. **Independent practice** — accuracy on mixed prefix/suffix task
5. **Exit ticket** — 3 targeted questions covering both rules + one interleaved question

### Assessment criteria (derived from graph concepts, not provided as-is):
- **Secure:** Consistently adds prefixes without changing root word; identifies stressed syllable and applies doubling rule correctly for familiar words
- **Developing:** Adds common prefixes correctly; doubling rule applied inconsistently
- **Beginning:** Understands concept of prefix but makes errors with root word spelling; does not apply doubling rule

**Graph assessment:** The misconception data for both concepts is genuinely excellent — it tells me exactly what errors to look for (e.g., "dissappoint", "enterring", "begining"). This is rare and valuable. However, there is no assessment framework, no link to KS2 test framework content domain codes, and no rubric. The assessment layer exists for KS2 test frameworks but isn't linked to individual concepts.

## 9. Common Misconceptions to Address ✅

**This is the graph's strongest area for this cluster.**

### From EN-Y3-C034 (Prefixes and suffixes):
- Children incorrectly change the root word when adding a prefix: "dissappoint" instead of "disappoint"
- Children forget to drop final 'e' before vowel suffixes: "hopeing" for "hoping"
- The -tion/-sion distinction is challenging because both produce a similar sound

### From EN-Y3-C035 (Suffix doubling):
- Doubling when they shouldn't: "enterring" (unstressed final syllable)
- Not doubling when they should: "begining" (stressed final syllable)
- Not understanding syllable stress — cannot apply the rule by ear
- Over-generalising: doubling consonants in ALL words when adding suffixes

**Graph assessment:** These misconceptions are specific, accurate, and directly actionable. I can build error-check activities around every one of them. This is the best data in the graph for lesson planning — better than most published schemes of work.

## 10. Worked Examples / Model Texts or Sentences ❌

**Graph provides teaching guidance that describes the KIND of examples needed but no actual worked examples, model sentences, or texts.**

### What the graph gives me:
- "Use word-sorting and word-building activities" (EN-Y3-C034)
- "Use sorting activities to practise identifying when doubling is needed" (EN-Y3-C035)
- "Contrast with words where the last syllable is not stressed" (EN-Y3-C035)

### What I need and the graph does NOT provide:
- A curated list of prefix + root word combinations at Y3 level
- Model sentences showing each prefix in context: "I _disapprove_ of that behaviour."
- A set of doubling/non-doubling word pairs: begin/beginning vs garden/gardening
- A model dictation passage incorporating this lesson's target spellings
- An annotated worked example showing the decision process: "The word is 'begin'. I want to add -ing. The stress is on the last syllable 'GIN'. The last syllable ends in a consonant after a single vowel. So I double the 'n': beginning."

**Graph assessment:** This is the biggest practical gap. The teaching guidance is excellent at describing pedagogy but provides zero concrete content. No word lists, no sentences, no passages. An AI agent would need to generate all of this — which is possible, but without curated word lists there's a risk of generating words that are too hard, too easy, or not on the statutory list.

## 11. Practice Activities / Writing Tasks ⚠️

**Graph's interaction types suggest activity FORMATS but not content.**

### Activities I can build from graph data:

| Activity | Graph Source | Content Status |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Pattern Discovery: "I Notice / I Wonder" | interaction_type: pattern_discovery | Format ✅, Content ❌ (no word sets provided) |
| Drag to Categorise: Sort by prefix | interaction_type: drag_categorise | Format ✅, Content ❌ (no card sets provided) |
| Matching Pairs: Root word ↔ derived word | interaction_type: matching_pairs | Format ✅, Content ❌ (no pair lists provided) |
| Multiple Choice: Which spelling is correct? | interaction_type: multi_choice_3 | Format ✅, Content ❌ (no questions provided) |
| Text Input: Spell the derived word | interaction_type: text_input_word | Format ✅, Content ❌ (no word list provided) |

**Graph assessment:** The interaction type descriptions are very good — they include practical implementation notes (e.g., "Limit to 2–3 categories for Y3", "Distractors should be near-misses"). But they are subject-agnostic. For a spelling lesson, I need the specific words, not just the activity format. The maths tools in the secondary interactions (area_model_multiplication, fraction_visualizer, etc.) are irrelevant here — this is a generic Y3 profile, not English-specific.

## 12. Cross-Curricular Links ⚠️

**Graph has CO_TEACHES relationships but limited cross-subject links for English.**

### Within English:
- EN-Y3-C035 CO_TEACHES → EN-Y3-C034 (suffix doubling ↔ prefix/suffix rules) — correct, these are co-teachable
- EN-Y3-C035 CO_TEACHES → EN-Y3-C039 (suffix doubling → possessive apostrophes) — reasonable connection
- EN-Y3-D007-CL003 (vocabulary/grammar cluster) covers prefixes for noun formation — clear link to this spelling cluster

### Cross-subject (NOT in graph, but obvious in practice):
- Science vocabulary: prefix "re-" (reversible/irreversible), "dis-" (dissolve, disappear), "un-" (unchanged)
- History: prefix "pre-" (prehistoric, pre-Roman)
- Maths: prefix "multi-" (multiply, multiple), suffix -er (greater, fewer)

**Graph assessment:** The CO_TEACHES relationships within English are sound. But there is no DEVELOPS_SKILL link from English concepts to ReadingSkill nodes (the epistemic skills layer has these for Science, Geography, History but not English). The cross-subject vocabulary links that every Y3 teacher uses daily are completely absent.
