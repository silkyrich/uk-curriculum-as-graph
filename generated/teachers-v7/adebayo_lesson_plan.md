## 1. Learning Objectives ✅

By the end of this lesson, pupils will be able to:

**Geographical Knowledge:**
- Identify and describe the main climate zones of the world (tropical, subtropical, temperate, continental, polar, mountainous)
- Explain how climate determines the type of biome that exists in an area
- Name and locate major world biomes (rainforest, savannah, desert, grassland, deciduous forest, coniferous forest, tundra, polar ice)
- Describe the key stages of the water cycle (evaporation, condensation, precipitation, run-off, infiltration)

**Geographical Skills:**
- Use geographical enquiry to investigate the relationship between latitude, climate and biome distribution *(linked via `GE-KS2-C002 -> DEVELOPS_SKILL -> Geographical enquiry`)*
- Collect, present and interpret data about climate and biome characteristics *(linked via `GE-KS2-C002 -> DEVELOPS_SKILL -> Fieldwork: data collection and presentation`)*

**Systems Thinking (from ThinkingLens):**
- Identify the components of the water cycle as an interconnected system
- Trace how a change in one part of the system affects others
- Use a simple diagram or flow chart as a model of the water cycle

**Rating**: ✅ Strong — the graph provides clear concept descriptions, geographical skill links, and a thinking lens with specific question stems. The two concepts in this cluster give genuine depth for a 60-minute Y5 lesson.

---

## 2. Success Criteria ⚠️

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|---------|
| **All pupils** | I can name at least 4 climate zones and locate them on a world map. I can label the key stages of the water cycle. |
| **Most pupils** | I can explain how latitude affects climate and why certain biomes exist in certain zones. I can describe the water cycle as a system with inputs, processes and outputs. |
| **Some pupils** | I can explain what would happen if one part of the water cycle changed (e.g., increased evaporation due to warming) and predict the effect on biomes. I can identify exceptions to expected climate-biome patterns and explain why they occur. |

**Rating**: ⚠️ Derived — the graph provides concept descriptions and misconception data that strongly inform these criteria, but there are no explicit success criteria or assessment thresholds. No DifficultyLevel nodes exist for Geography (pilot is Y3 Maths only), so the "all/most/some" differentiation is my professional judgement, not graph-grounded.

---

## 3. Prior Knowledge Required ✅

From `PREREQUISITE_OF` relationships:

| Prior Concept | Source Domain | What pupils should know |
|---------------|--------------|------------------------|
| **Weather and Climate** | `GE-KS1-D003` (Human and Physical Geography, KS1) | Basic understanding of weather patterns — hot/cold, wet/dry. Seasonal weather in the UK. Difference between weather (day-to-day) and climate (long-term average). |
| **Latitude, Longitude and the Global Grid** | `GE-KS2-D001` (Locational Knowledge, KS2) | Understanding that the Equator, Tropics and Poles are key latitude lines. Ability to locate places using coordinates on a globe or atlas. This is a keystone concept in the graph. |

**Activation strategy** (from pedagogy profile — "generation effect"): Begin the lesson by asking pupils to recall what they know about latitude and the Equator. "What do you remember about the lines on a globe? Why do we call the Equator the most important one?"

**Rating**: ✅ Strong — the graph clearly identifies both prerequisites, one from KS1 and one from KS2, with the KS2 prerequisite flagged as a keystone concept. This tells me exactly where to pitch the lesson.

## 4. Lesson Structure with Timings ⚠️

### Introduction — Challenge Problem (10 minutes)

**Productive failure setup** *(from pedagogy profile: session_sequence starts with challenge_problem → exploration)*

**Activity**: Display a world map with four unlabelled photographs:
1. Tropical rainforest (dense canopy, heavy rainfall)
2. Sahara Desert (sand dunes, extreme heat)
3. UK temperate woodland (deciduous trees, green fields)
4. Arctic tundra (ice, sparse vegetation)

**Socratic questioning sequence** *(from `inference_task` interaction type)*:
1. "What do you notice about these four places?" (observation)
2. "What does that tell you about the climate in each place?" (inference)
3. "Why do you think these places have such different climates?" (reasoning)
4. "What would need to be different for a rainforest to grow in the Arctic?" (counterfactual)

**Do NOT** affirm or deny during the chain — let pupils reason. This is productive failure activation.

**Pattern discovery** *(from `pattern_discovery` interaction type)*:
After 3-4 responses: "That's interesting. What else do you notice about WHERE on the map these places are?"

Guide pupils towards the latitude pattern: places near the Equator are typically warmer; places near the Poles are colder.

### Main Activity — Exploration and Instruction (35 minutes)

#### Part A: Climate Zones and Biomes (20 minutes)

**Instruction phase** *(faded worked example, from pedagogy profile)*:

1. **Teacher models** (5 min): Using a large world biome map, trace the pattern of climate zones from Equator to Pole along one meridian. Model the thinking: "At the Equator, the sun is almost directly overhead — maximum heating — so the climate is tropical. The biome here is tropical rainforest because the combination of heat and rainfall supports dense vegetation. As we move north..."

2. **Faded example** (5 min): Pupils complete the next climate zone analysis with partial scaffolding. Provide a table:

   | Latitude Band | Climate Zone | Temperature | Rainfall | Expected Biome |
   |--------------|-------------|-------------|----------|----------------|
   | 0–23.5°N/S | Tropical | Hot (>25°C avg) | Very high | ? |
   | 23.5–35°N/S | Subtropical | Warm-hot | ? | Desert / Savannah |
   | 35–55°N/S | ? | Mild, seasonal | Moderate | Deciduous forest / Grassland |
   | 55–66.5°N/S | Continental | ? | Low-moderate | ? |
   | 66.5–90°N/S | Polar | ? | ? | ? |

   Pupils fill the gaps, using the atlas and what they observed in the introduction.

3. **Misconception address** *(from concept `common_misconceptions`)*:
   - "Are deserts always hot?" — Introduce the Gobi Desert (cold desert) and Antarctica (technically a desert by precipitation). Challenge the assumption.
   - "Are tropical regions always wet?" — Distinguish tropical wet (rainforest) from tropical dry (savannah) seasons.
   - "Is climate zone the same as biome?" — Clarify: climate determines what biome CAN exist; a biome is the ecological community that develops in response.

4. **Drag to categorise** *(from `drag_categorise` interaction type)*: Sort biome characteristics (vegetation type, animal adaptations, temperature range, rainfall) into 4-5 biome categories. In feedback, explain the classification principle — what makes a rainforest a rainforest is the combination of factors, not just one.

#### Part B: The Water Cycle as a System (15 minutes)

**Systems and System Models lens** *(from ThinkingLens PROMPT_FOR)*:

1. **Systems mapping** (8 min): Pupils work in pairs to create a water cycle system diagram. Provide a template with boxes for components (ocean, atmosphere, land, rivers) and arrows for processes.

   **Key questions** *(from thinking lens question stems)*:
   - "What goes INTO the atmosphere? What comes OUT?" (inputs/outputs)
   - "If you changed the temperature — say it got 3°C warmer — what else would be affected?" (system change)
   - "Where does the water cycle start and end?" (trick question — it's a cycle, there's no start)
   - "How could we draw a model to explain how this works?" (modelling)

2. **River system connection** (7 min): Link the water cycle to river systems (concept `GE-KS2-C003`). Key vocabulary: source, mouth, tributary, drainage basin, meander, flood plain.

   **Misconception address** *(from concept data)*:
   - "Do rivers ever flow uphill?" — No, gravity determines direction. Use a local Liverpool example (the Mersey flows west to the Irish Sea because the land slopes that way).
   - "The water cycle is just rain falling and going back up" — Show the variety of pathways: groundwater, evapotranspiration, run-off, infiltration. It's more complex than the simple circle diagram.

### Plenary — Retrieval and Application (15 minutes)

**Multiple choice with misconception-targeted distractors** *(from `multi_choice_4` interaction type)* (5 min):

Q1: "The Gobi Desert has very little rainfall and freezing winter temperatures. Which statement best explains why?"
- A) Deserts are always hot, so the Gobi must be an exception *(misconception: deserts = hot)*
- B) The Gobi is at high altitude and far from any ocean, so it receives very little moisture *(correct)*
- C) The Gobi is near the Equator where it is dry *(misconception: confusing desert location)*
- D) Deserts only form in tropical climate zones *(misconception: single-zone assumption)*

Q2: "A city's water supply comes from a reservoir fed by a river. If climate change reduces rainfall in the river's drainage basin, what is most likely to happen?"
- A) The river will flow faster because there is less water *(misconception: less = faster)*
- B) The reservoir will have less water because less rain means less run-off into the river *(correct — systems thinking)*
- C) Nothing will change because the water cycle always provides the same amount *(misconception: static system)*
- D) The ocean will dry up first *(misconception: scale confusion)*

**Extended writing** *(from `text_input_sentence` interaction type)* (7 min):

"Using what you have learned today, explain why a tropical rainforest could not survive in the UK. Use the terms 'climate zone', 'latitude', 'precipitation' and 'biome' in your answer."

Scaffold if needed: "The UK is located at a latitude of approximately..."

**Reflection** (3 min): "One thing I now understand about how climate, biomes and the water cycle are connected as a SYSTEM is..."

**Rating**: ⚠️ Adequate structure from graph data, but significant gaps. The pedagogy profile session sequence, interaction types, thinking lens question stems, and misconception data all contributed real planning value. However: no content vehicle means I had to invent all activities, resources, and the specific geographical contexts (Liverpool/Mersey, Gobi Desert). The graph tells me WHAT to teach and HOW to frame it, but not WITH what materials.

## 5. Key Vocabulary with Definitions ✅

### Climate Zones and Biomes (from `GE-KS2-C002`)
| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| climate zone | A large area of the Earth with similar patterns of temperature and rainfall |

| infiltration | Water soaking into the ground through soil and rock |

**Rating**: ✅ Excellent — 28 terms provided directly from concept `key_vocabulary` properties. Definitions are mine (the graph provides the terms but not child-friendly definitions), which is a gap, but the vocabulary lists are comprehensive and curriculum-aligned.

---

## 6. Resources and Materials Needed ❌

The graph provides **no resource data** for KS2 Geography. No content vehicles exist (vehicles are KS3 only). I would need:

| Resource | Purpose | Source |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Large world biome map (wall display or digital) | Part A — tracing climate zones from Equator to Pole | Teacher-sourced |
| 4 unlabelled photographs (rainforest, desert, temperate, tundra) | Introduction — productive failure challenge | Teacher-sourced |
| Atlas set (1 per pair) | Pupils locate climate zones and biomes | School resource |
| Climate zone table template (printed) | Part A — faded worked example | Teacher-created |
| Water cycle system diagram template | Part B — systems mapping activity | Teacher-created |
| OS map of local area showing the Mersey | Part B — connecting rivers to local geography | Teacher-sourced (my specialism!) |
| Mini whiteboards | Plenary — multiple choice responses | School resource |
| Lined paper / exercise books | Extended writing task | School resource |

**Rating**: ❌ Complete gap. The graph has zero resource/material information for this cluster. Everything above is teacher knowledge. A content vehicle (like the `case_study` type used for KS3 Geography) would transform this — providing curated data points, photographs, source materials and assessment guidance.

---

## 7. Differentiation (Support + Extension) ⚠️

### Support (from scaffolding_level: "light_to_moderate")

- **Climate zone table**: Pre-fill more cells for pupils who need support; reduce to 3 zones (tropical, temperate, polar) before introducing the full set
- **Water cycle template**: Provide process words on cards to physically place on the diagram rather than recalling from memory
- **Vocabulary mat**: Key terms with simple definitions and images available throughout
- **Sentence starters** for extended writing (from `text_input_sentence` interaction type guidance): "The UK is located at a latitude of approximately... This means the climate is... so the biome is..."
- **Hint tiers** (max 4 per the Y5 profile): If stuck on the challenge problem, provide hints in sequence: (1) "Look at where each place is on the map" → (2) "What do you notice about how far from the Equator they are?" → (3) "Remember what we learned about latitude and temperature" → (4) "Places near the Equator receive more direct sunlight"

### Extension

- **Exception hunting**: Find biomes that don't match the expected latitude pattern (e.g., Mediterranean climate in California, montane forests at altitude in the tropics). Explain why using systems thinking.
- **Climate change connection**: "If average global temperature rises by 2°C, predict which biome boundaries will shift and in which direction." Requires application of the systems model.
- **Data interpretation**: Provide climate data (temperature and precipitation tables) for two locations; pupils determine the climate zone and predict the biome without being told the location.
- **Cross-curricular maths link**: Calculate the temperature difference between climate zones at different latitudes; use this to estimate the rate of temperature change per degree of latitude.

**Rating**: ⚠️ Partial — the scaffolding level, hint tier count, and interaction type guidance provide a framework for differentiation. But there's no DifficultyLevel data for Geography (no `entry → developing → expected → greater_depth` structure with specific tasks and example responses). I'm generating differentiation from professional judgement, not graph-grounded difficulty tiers.

## 8. Assessment Opportunities ⚠️

| When | What | Assessment Type | Graph-Informed? |
|------|------|----------------|-----------------|
| Introduction | Observe quality of reasoning during Socratic questioning | Formative (teacher observation) | Yes — interaction type guides the questioning sequence |
| Part A | Check completed climate zone table against model answer | Formative (written) | Partial — concept data informs content, no model answer provided |
| Part A | Listen to misconception responses (hot deserts, wet tropics) | Formative (teacher observation) | Yes — misconceptions listed in concept node |
| Part B | Assess water cycle system diagram for completeness and accuracy | Formative (peer assessment) | Partial — concept vocabulary provides criteria |
| Plenary MC | Track correct/incorrect responses to misconception-targeted questions | Formative (whole-class) | Yes — misconceptions directly inform distractors |
| Plenary writing | Assess extended response for use of technical vocabulary and explanatory reasoning | Summative (written) | Partial — vocabulary from graph, no rubric provided |

**Rating**: ⚠️ Adequate — misconception data and vocabulary lists directly support assessment design. However, there is no assessment rubric, no marking criteria, no worked example of an expected response, and no assessment_guidance property (which content vehicles have for KS3 but don't exist for KS2). The DifficultyLevel nodes would help enormously here — if Geography had `entry/developing/expected/greater_depth` levels with `example_task` and `example_response`, I could build a proper assessment framework.

---

## 9. Common Misconceptions to Address ✅

### Climate Zones and Biomes (from `GE-KS2-C002`)

| Misconception | Correction Strategy |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Climate zone = biome (used interchangeably) | Explicitly teach: climate determines the biome. Same climate zone can host different biomes depending on local conditions. Use the table activity to show the distinction. |
| Deserts are always hot | Introduce Gobi Desert (cold) and Antarctica (technically a desert). Ask: "What makes a desert a desert?" — it's about precipitation, not temperature. |
| Tropical regions are always wet | Distinguish tropical wet (rainforest) and tropical dry (savannah with wet/dry seasons). Show rainfall data for both. |
| Human activity hasn't changed biomes | Discuss deforestation, agriculture, urbanisation. "What biome SHOULD this area be?" vs "What is it now?" — powerful for sustainability awareness. |

### River Systems and the Water Cycle (from `GE-KS2-C003`)

| Misconception | Correction Strategy |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Rivers sometimes flow uphill | Use the Mersey as a local example. Trace from source in the Pennines to the mouth at Liverpool Bay. "Gravity ALWAYS pulls water downhill." |
| The water cycle is just rain going up and coming back down | Show the full range of pathways: groundwater, evapotranspiration from plants, run-off over impermeable surfaces, infiltration into soil. Use the systems diagram. |
| Rivers are separate from the water cycle | Explicitly connect: precipitation → run-off → river → ocean → evaporation. Rivers ARE part of the water cycle. |

**Rating**: ✅ Excellent — the graph provides specific, well-articulated misconceptions for both concepts, with enough detail to inform targeted correction strategies. This is one of the strongest data sources in the graph for planning.

---

## 10. Worked Examples / Model Geographical Analysis ❌

The graph provides **no worked examples** for Geography. The DifficultyLevel pilot (Y3 Maths) includes `example_task` and `example_response` properties that would be exactly what's needed here, but they don't exist for Geography.

**What I would need from the graph:**

**Model analysis — Systems thinking:**
> *Task*: "Look at the water cycle diagram. If temperatures increased by 3°C globally, explain what would happen to evaporation rates and how this would affect precipitation patterns."
>
> *Expected Y5 response*: "If temperatures rose by 3 degrees, more water would evaporate from the oceans because warmer air holds more moisture. This means there would be more water vapour in the atmosphere, which would lead to more condensation and heavier precipitation in some areas. But it wouldn't rain more everywhere — some places might get drier because the patterns of where rain falls would shift. This shows the water cycle is a system where changing one part (temperature) affects all the other parts."
>
> *Common error*: "It would rain more everywhere because there is more water in the sky." (Misses the spatial redistribution — systems thinking gap.)

**Model analysis — Biome classification:**
> *Task*: "This location has an average temperature of 26°C and annual rainfall of 150mm. Which biome would you expect? Explain your reasoning."
>
> *Expected Y5 response*: "I would expect a desert or hot desert biome. Although the temperature is tropical (above 25°C), the rainfall is very low at only 150mm per year. Deserts have less than 250mm of rainfall, so this fits. The hot temperature tells me it is likely in the subtropical climate zone between the Tropics and about 35 degrees latitude."

**Rating**: ❌ Not available — this is a significant gap for upper KS2 where we expect more sophisticated geographical analysis. I've had to write these entirely from subject knowledge.

---

## 11. Practice Activities / Enquiry Tasks ⚠️

### Geographical Enquiry Task (aligned to `Geographical enquiry` skill link)

**Title**: "Why do biome boundaries shift — and should we be worried?"

**Setup**: Provide pupils with two world biome maps — one from 1990 and one projected for 2050.

**Enquiry sequence** *(informed by pedagogy profile session sequence)*:
1. **Notice** (pattern_discovery): "What differences can you see between the two maps?"
2. **Question**: "Why are the biome boundaries moving?"
3. **Hypothesise**: "What do you think is causing this change?" (generation effect — recall before instruction)
4. **Investigate**: Compare climate data for the same locations across two time periods
5. **Conclude**: Write an explanation using the systems model — how does changing temperature alter the system?

### Fieldwork Connection (aligned to `Fieldwork: data collection and presentation` skill link)

**Local investigation**: "What biome is Liverpool in, and how do we know?"
- Use weather data from a local weather station (or school weather station if available)
- Compare Liverpool's temperature and rainfall data to the characteristics of the temperate deciduous forest biome
- Walk to the nearest green space — what evidence of this biome can we observe? (deciduous trees, seasonal changes, moderate undergrowth)
- Connect to the Mersey drainage basin using OS maps

### Data Interpretation Task

Provide climate graphs (temperature and rainfall) for:
- Manaus, Brazil (tropical rainforest)
- Cairo, Egypt (hot desert)
- Liverpool, UK (temperate oceanic)
- Tromsø, Norway (subarctic/tundra border)

Pupils classify each into its climate zone and predict the biome, then check against a biome map.

**Rating**: ⚠️ Partial — the geographical skill links (`Geographical enquiry`, `Fieldwork: data collection and presentation`) directly prompted these activities, and the thinking lens question stems shaped the enquiry sequence. But I had to create the actual activity content, data sources, and local context entirely from teacher knowledge. A content vehicle with `data_points`, `themes`, and `assessment_guidance` (like the KS3 Geography vehicles) would have provided this.

---

## 12. Cross-Curricular Links ⚠️

| Subject | Connection | Graph Evidence |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| **Science** | Water cycle = evaporation and condensation (states of matter, Y4 Science). Habitats and adaptation (Y4 Science — Living Things and Their Habitats). | `CO_TEACHES` hints on climate/biomes concept reference science connections; prerequisite chains would show the Science concepts. No direct cross-subject `CO_TEACHES` relationship to Geography in the graph data. |
| **Maths** | Reading coordinates (latitude/longitude = coordinate system). Interpreting climate data graphs (statistics — Y5 Maths). Calculating temperature ranges. Scale on maps. | Prerequisite concept `GE-KS2-C001` (Latitude/Longitude) teaching guidance references "drawing parallels with grid references." No formal `CO_TEACHES` link to Maths concepts. |
| **English** | Extended geographical writing in the plenary. Non-fiction text features (headings, diagrams, captions) when reading about biomes. | Y5 learner profile states "Questions can require paragraph-length written responses" and "Use domain-specific register." No explicit English cross-link. |
| **Computing** | Digital mapping / GIS tools referenced in the curriculum context for this domain. | Domain `curriculum_context` mentions "GIS" and "digital and computer mapping tools." No formal link to Computing concepts. |
| **PSHE / Eco Council** | Climate change and sustainability — why biome boundaries shift, human responsibility. | Concept teaching guidance mentions "Explore how climate change is altering biome boundaries" — directly connects to sustainability education. |

**Rating**: ⚠️ Partial — the graph provides hints through `co_teach_hints`, `curriculum_context`, and teaching guidance, but there are no formal cross-subject `CO_TEACHES` relationships for Geography. The 66 curated cross-domain links in the graph are within-subject or between closely related subjects (Science↔Maths, etc.) — Geography is not yet included in the cross-subject link set.
