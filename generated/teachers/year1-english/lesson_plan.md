# Lesson Plan: Understand Phonemes, Graphemes and Their Correspondence

| | |
|---|---|
| **Cluster** | `EN-KS1-D002-CL001` |
| **Subject** | English — Reading (Word Reading) |
| **Year Group** | Year 1 |
| **Key Stage** | KS1 |
| **Domain** | Reading — Word Reading (`EN-KS1-D002`) |
| **Estimated teaching time** | 4 lessons (~1.3 weeks) |
| **Cluster type** | Introduction — Keystone cluster |
| **Leads to** | `EN-KS1-D002-CL002` (Assessment: Phoneme, Grapheme, GPC) |

---

## At a Glance

- This cluster establishes the three conceptual foundations of systematic phonics: what a phoneme is, what a grapheme is, and how they correspond. These cannot be taught in isolation — they are mutually defining, and the teaching sequence here treats them as co-constructed knowledge.
- Two of the three concepts (Phoneme and GPC) are marked as **keystone concepts** in the graph. This means children who leave this cluster without a secure grasp of those two ideas will struggle with every subsequent phonics cluster. Do not move on without checking.
- The cluster feeds directly into decoding and blending practice (`CL003`) and underpins the Phonics Screening Check at the end of Year 1. Everything downstream depends on this foundation being solid.
- Year 1 children at this stage cannot read independently. All learning must be spoken, heard, and physically enacted — not text-dependent.

## Curriculum Context

**Domain:** Reading — Word Reading at KS1 teaches the alphabetic code systematically. Children learn that spoken sounds (phonemes) are represented by letters or letter combinations (graphemes), and that matching one to the other (grapheme-phoneme correspondence, or GPC) is the engine of decoding. Automaticity — reading words without conscious effort — is the long-term goal, freeing cognitive resources for comprehension.

**This cluster is the first in the domain.** There are no preceding clusters; this is the starting point for systematic phonics in Year 1.

**What comes immediately before (reception-level prior knowledge):**
Children will have heard phonics language used in Reception during early phonics exposure (typically Letters and Sounds Phase 1 or Read Write Inc. Set 1 Sounds). They may be able to say some phonemes and recognise some letters, but their conceptual understanding of what a phoneme or grapheme *is* — as a teachable category — is unlikely to be secure. Treat this cluster as a genuine introduction to the vocabulary and concepts, even if some phoneme sounds are already familiar.

**What follows next:**
`EN-KS1-D002-CL002` — Assessment cluster checking secure knowledge of all three concepts before the class moves to blending and segmenting (`CL003`). This assessment gate matters: children who are unclear on the phoneme/grapheme distinction will misread digraphs throughout their entire phonics journey.

**Programme fit:**
This cluster sits at the very opening of the KS1 English Reading programme. It is designed to be taught in the first weeks of Year 1 as part of the school's daily phonics session. It does not depend on any concurrent cluster and should be completed before CL003 is introduced.

---

## Prerequisite Check

**Children need to arrive with:**
- Some experience of hearing sounds in words (Phase 1 phonological awareness — clapping syllables, rhyming, alliteration)
- Familiarity with the physical alphabet — that letters are written symbols (not necessarily knowledge of all letter names)
- Attention and listening stamina for a 5–10 minute structured session

**How to check readiness (5 minutes, session 1 warm-up):**
Ask children to clap the beats in 'elephant' and 'cat'. Then say: "I'm going to say a word really slowly — /c/ /a/ /t/ — what word is that?" Children who can do this basic oral blending have sufficient phonological awareness to begin. Children who cannot should be flagged for additional Phase 1 support running alongside this cluster — do not hold back the class, but note who needs parallel intervention.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this cluster, pupils will be able to:

1. **Identify** a phoneme as a single unit of sound in a spoken word (e.g., locate /s/ in 'sun')
2. **Recognise** a grapheme as the written representation of a phoneme, including single letters and digraphs (e.g., 'sh', 'ch')
3. **Match** a spoken phoneme to its corresponding grapheme when given a choice of two options
4. **Explain** (in their own words, orally) the relationship between a sound and the letter(s) that represent it
5. **Count** the phonemes in a 3–4 phoneme CVC and CCVC word correctly, without conflating phoneme count with letter count

Objectives 1, 3, and 5 are the direct measures for the two keystone concepts (Phoneme and GPC). These are the non-negotiables before moving to assessment cluster CL002.

---

## Key Vocabulary

The following vocabulary must be explicitly taught and revisited daily. Year 1 children need multi-day exposure before a word becomes usable. Do not assume a word taught once is known.

**Tier 3 (subject-specific — must be taught explicitly):**

| Word | What it means for this age group | How to introduce it |
|---|---|---|
| **phoneme** | "A sound our mouth makes — the tiniest sound in a word" | Say it, hold up one finger. Use every session. "This is a phoneme." |
| **grapheme** | "The letter (or letters) we write for that sound" | Show a flashcard. "This is a grapheme — it shows us how to write /sh/." |
| **GPC / sound-letter match** | "When we know which sound goes with which letters" | "Now we know the grapheme AND the phoneme — that's our phonics code!" |
| **digraph** | "Two letters that make one sound together" | Introduce only in lesson 3 once single-letter GPCs are secure. Use 'sh' in 'ship' as the anchor example. |

**Tier 2 (general academic words children need but may not have):**
*sound, letter, listen, match, split*

**Reinforcement strategy:**
Display a simple classroom phonics chart showing each grapheme with its picture cue (the anchor image from your phonics scheme). Point to it when naming the grapheme every time. Children should be able to tap the chart and say the phoneme within the first week. Avoid asking children to read the word 'phoneme' — this is oral vocabulary at this stage. In AI sessions, always speak the word aloud before any visual appears.

---

## Common Misconceptions

These are derived directly from the concept data. Each one is specific and predictable — plan for them, do not wait to encounter them.

**1. "One letter = one sound" (affects both Phoneme and GPC)**
Children who have only seen single-letter phonemes will assume this is always true. The confusion becomes acute when they first encounter 'sh' or 'ch' and try to read them as two separate phonemes.
*How to address it:* In lesson 3, make the surprise explicit: "Wait — two letters, but listen: /sh/ — that's ONE sound. Isn't that interesting? That's a special thing called a digraph." Do not present this as a rule violation — frame it as discovering how the code works. Show the digraph as a single tile (in the Phoneme Splitter interaction, digraphs are kept as single blocks — this is intentional).

**2. Counting letters instead of sounds (affects Phoneme)**
When asked "how many sounds in 'ship'?", children will often say 4 (s-h-i-p) rather than 3 (/sh/-/i/-/p/). This is one of the most common errors in early phonics and it directly predicts difficulty in the Phonics Screening Check.
*How to address it:* Never let children count sounds by looking at the written word in early sessions — work orally first. Say the word aloud, then ask them to hold up a finger for each sound they *hear*. Only after oral counting should you show the word. Use the Phoneme Splitter tool to make the mismatch visible: children can see that 'sh' is one tile, not two.

**3. The schwa on consonant phonemes (affects Phoneme)**
Children frequently say 'buh', 'cuh', 'duh' instead of the pure phoneme. This creates problems when blending: 'cuh-a-tuh' does not blend to 'cat'. It is a teaching habit problem as much as a children problem — check your own delivery first.
*How to address it:* Model pure phoneme production explicitly in every session. Use a mirror activity: children hold a hand mirror and watch their mouth. "When I say /b/, I don't say 'buh'. Listen: /b/. Short and sharp. Now you." Use the Voice Input interaction to support self-monitoring — children hear their own voice played back.

**4. The same phoneme can have different graphemes (affects GPC)**
Children become confused when /ee/ appears as 'ee' in 'feet', 'ea' in 'beat', and 'e-e' in 'these'. This is not a lesson 1 problem — you do not teach alternative spellings in this cluster — but you will encounter it when children ask "but why?". Have a simple answer ready: "Yes, the same sound can wear different clothes! We'll learn all the outfits it wears." Flag it and move on; do not resolve it now.

---

## Lesson Sequence

All four lessons follow the session sequence mandated by the pedagogy profile: **worked example → guided practice → retrieval practice**. Each session is 5–12 minutes. Scaffolding is at maximum throughout. Do not introduce productive failure or open-ended challenge at this stage — worked examples come before every practice attempt, every time.

Each lesson below is designed as a standalone phonics session that can sit within the school's existing daily phonics timetable. They are sequential but each one begins with retrieval of the previous lesson before introducing new content.

---

### Lesson 1: What is a Phoneme?

**Concept focus:** Phoneme (`EN-KS1-C001` — keystone)
**Duration:** 10–12 minutes

#### Session phases

**Phase 1 — Retrieval warm-up (2 minutes)**
*This is the first lesson of the cluster, so there is no prior cluster content to retrieve. Use prior phonological awareness instead.*
Teacher: "Let's play a listening game. I'm going to say a word very slowly. When you hear the first sound, pop up your thumb." Say: /s/...un. Pause. /m/...op. Pause. /t/...ap. This activates phoneme-level listening without requiring the concept vocabulary yet.

**Phase 2 — Worked example (4 minutes)**
Teacher models explicitly. Use physical props: a large card showing the word 'cat' with a coloured dot under each letter. Say:
"Listen. Cat. /c/... /a/... /t/. I can hear THREE sounds. Watch my fingers — one for each sound I hear." Hold up three fingers, one at a time, while saying each phoneme slowly. "These sounds are called phonemes. A phoneme is a sound. /c/ is a phoneme. /a/ is a phoneme. /t/ is a phoneme."
Repeat with 'sun'. Say each phoneme. Count with fingers. "How many phonemes? Three. /s/ /u/ /n/."
Crucial: do not write the words up yet. Work entirely orally for this phase.

**Phase 3 — Guided practice (4 minutes)**
Say a word. Children hold up fingers together with teacher. Use: 'big', 'hop', 'pin', 'mud'. Teacher counts aloud and children follow. Then try 'mat' — teacher starts, children join in by the third phoneme. "Your turn with me: /m/..."
Do not move to independent practice on day one. This is still "doing it together".

**Phase 4 — Retrieval practice / close (2 minutes)**
Ask two children at random: "What do we call the sounds in words?" If they cannot say 'phoneme', model the answer yourself and have the class say it together three times. "Say it with me: phoneme, phoneme, phoneme." Close positively: "You listened to sounds today — that's what phonemes are."

**Interaction types used:**
- Voice Input: children say phonemes aloud when teacher points — the physical voice is the interaction here. In an AI session, use `voice_input` for the worked example phase: AI speaks the word, child responds with the phoneme they hear.
- Multiple Choice 2 Options (`multi_choice_2`): present two spoken words, ask "which word starts with /s/?" — 'sun' or 'bat'. Use images, not text. Image of sun vs image of bat.

**Differentiation:**
- Support: Reduce to 2-phoneme words ('up', 'it', 'on'). Teacher sits alongside and physically guides the child's hand to hold up fingers. Provide a finger-puppet phoneme counter.
- Core: 3-phoneme CVC words as described above.
- Challenge: 4-phoneme words ('frog', 'clap'). Ask: "How many sounds did you hear? Was it more than cat?"

---

### Lesson 2: What is a Grapheme?

**Concept focus:** Grapheme (`EN-KS1-C002`)
**Duration:** 10–12 minutes

#### Session phases

**Phase 1 — Retrieval warm-up (2 minutes)**
Hold up a picture card (sun). "What's the first phoneme in 'sun'?" Expect: /s/. "What's the last phoneme?" Expect: /n/. Repeat with 'pot'. Children give phonemes orally. Name the concept: "We're listening for phonemes."

**Phase 2 — Worked example (4 minutes)**
Now bring in the written form. Show the word 'sat' written large on card, with phoneme dots underneath. Say: "We know /s/ is a phoneme — a sound. Now look: this letter — the teacher points to 's' — is called a grapheme. The grapheme 's' is how we write the phoneme /s/. The sound has a written shape. This is its grapheme."
Show next grapheme: 'a'. "This grapheme is how we write /a/." Then 't'. "How we write /t/."
Now introduce a key distinction: show 'shop'. "Look — this word has four letters. But how many phonemes?" Count orally together: /sh/ /o/ /p/ — three. "These two letters — 'sh' — they work together to make ONE phoneme: /sh/. Together, they are ONE grapheme."
Do not fully teach digraphs yet — plant the seed, return to it in lesson 3.

**Phase 3 — Guided practice (4 minutes)**
Show flashcards of graphemes from the current phonics programme set (s, a, t, p, i, n). Teacher holds up grapheme, children say phoneme. Then reverse: teacher says phoneme, children point to the grapheme on the class display chart. Use the Letter Toggler interaction (`letter_toggler`) in an AI session: display a row of grapheme tiles, ask child to tap the one that makes the sound they hear. Keep to single-letter graphemes at this stage.

**Phase 4 — Retrieval practice / close (2 minutes)**
Hold up two flashcards. "Is this a grapheme? Yes or no? Tell your partner." Then: "A grapheme is the letter we write for a..." pause for children to complete: "...sound." Say it together. "Phoneme is the sound. Grapheme is the written letters."

**Interaction types used:**
- `multi_choice_2`: Show two grapheme tiles, say a phoneme aloud. "Tap the one that makes /s/." Use familiar graphemes only (s, a, t, p, i, n from the phonics programme set 1).
- `letter_toggler`: Display a row of letter tiles. Ask child to tap the grapheme that matches the spoken phoneme. Keep tasks concrete and single-letter at this stage. Do not use for phoneme discrimination (that belongs to `phoneme_splitter`).
- `voice_input`: Child says the phoneme for a displayed grapheme. AI plays back transcription and confirms: "I heard /s/ — that matches!"

**Differentiation:**
- Support: Reduce grapheme set to 3 known letters (s, a, t). Use matching game — picture of sun on one card, grapheme 's' on another. Match them. Child says the phoneme when the match is made.
- Core: 6 graphemes (s, a, t, p, i, n) as above.
- Challenge: Can the child tell you the grapheme for /ch/ before it has been formally taught? Use this to gauge readiness for lesson 3.

---

### Lesson 3: Phoneme Meets Grapheme — One Sound, One Written Shape

**Concept focus:** Grapheme-Phoneme Correspondence (`EN-KS1-C003` — keystone) + digraph introduction
**Duration:** 12 minutes

#### Session phases

**Phase 1 — Retrieval warm-up (2 minutes)**
Quick flashcard round: show graphemes (s, a, t, p, i, n, m, d). Children call out phonemes. Then reverse: say a phoneme, children find the grapheme on the display chart and point. Keep pace brisk — this is retrieval, not re-teaching.

**Phase 2 — Worked example (5 minutes)**
Introduce GPC explicitly as the relationship between the two things they now know. "You know what a phoneme is. You know what a grapheme is. Phonics is learning which grapheme goes with which phoneme. That match is called a grapheme-phoneme correspondence — or GPC. Every time you learn a new sound and its written shape, you're learning a new GPC."
Model with 'ship': "The phoneme is /sh/. The grapheme is 'sh'. The GPC is: /sh/ goes with the letters s-h together. Not separately — together."
Use the Phoneme Splitter (`phoneme_splitter`) here: display the word 'ship' as three tiles: [sh] [i] [p]. Point to the 'sh' tile. "One tile, one phoneme, one grapheme. Can you see how 'sh' stays together?"
Tap each tile to play the phoneme. Drag them apart and back together. Model this fully before children try.

**Phase 3 — Guided practice (4 minutes)**
Use the Phoneme Splitter with a different word: 'chin'. Ask children to predict: "How many tiles will 'chin' have?" (Answer: 3 — [ch] [i] [n].) Then show the split word. Tap each tile together. Children call out the phoneme. Teacher confirms.
In a classroom setting without AI tools: write 'chip', 'shop', 'that' on the board. Place a coloured arc under digraph pairs to show they are one grapheme. Children use mini-whiteboards to draw the arc on a word you write.

**Phase 4 — Retrieval practice / close (1 minute)**
"What is a GPC? Tell your partner." Take one answer. Confirm: "A GPC is when a sound has a written match — a phoneme and a grapheme that go together." Finish: "You just learned how the phonics code works."

**Interaction types used:**
- `phoneme_splitter`: This is the primary tool for this lesson. Digraphs must be kept as single tiles — this is hardcoded in the interaction spec and matches the learning intention exactly. Use after initial teacher-led exposure, not as the first introduction.
- `multi_choice_2`: Display a grapheme pair (e.g., 'sh' and 's'). Say the word 'ship'. "Which grapheme do you hear at the start?" Images alongside each option.
- `voice_input`: Ask child to say the phoneme they see on a displayed grapheme tile. AI confirms phonetically.

**Differentiation:**
- Support: Return to single-letter GPCs using a matching game — phoneme sound button (plays audio) next to a grapheme card. Child matches by placing the card next to the sound it represents.
- Core: Phoneme Splitter with 3-phoneme words including one digraph (ship, chin, that, shop).
- Challenge: 4-phoneme words with a digraph (e.g., 'brush', 'shred'). Ask: "How many GPCs are in this word?"

---

### Lesson 4: Putting It Together — Reviewing All Three Concepts

**Concept focus:** Consolidation of Phoneme + Grapheme + GPC
**Duration:** 10–12 minutes

This lesson does not introduce new content. Its purpose is to consolidate the three concepts as an interconnected system and prepare children for the assessment cluster (`CL002`).

#### Session phases

**Phase 1 — Retrieval warm-up (3 minutes)**
Three-part retrieval sequence. Hold up a grapheme flashcard: "What's the phoneme?" Then say a phoneme: "What's the grapheme?" Then show a word split into phoneme tiles: "How many GPCs?" Do not correct errors here — note them and use them in phase 2 to inform your explanation.

**Phase 2 — Worked example with the three-concept story (4 minutes)**
Use a simple narrative to tie all three concepts together. Teacher script example:
"Every word is made of sounds. We call those sounds phonemes. /c/ /a/ /t/ — three phonemes. When we want to write those sounds down, we use letters or groups of letters. We call those graphemes. 'c', 'a', 't' — three graphemes. The match between the sound and the written shape? That's a GPC. GPC means: this phoneme goes with this grapheme."
Write cat, ship, chin on the board. For each: name the phonemes, identify the graphemes, name one GPC. Children contribute after teacher models the pattern.

**Phase 3 — Guided practice (3 minutes)**
Children work in pairs. One child says a word slowly (from a picture card). The other holds up the correct number of fingers for the phoneme count. Teacher circulates.
In an AI session: use `multi_choice_2` to present a word image and two phoneme-count options. "Cat — is it two sounds or three?" Image of the number 2 vs number 3. Spoken question only.

**Phase 4 — Retrieval practice / close (2 minutes)**
Quick fire with the class: teacher points to a word on the board, children hold up fingers for phoneme count, then say the grapheme for the first phoneme. End the lesson by having children say the three words: "phoneme, grapheme, GPC" — in sequence. "We know all three. Tomorrow, we check!"

**Interaction types used:**
- `phoneme_splitter`: Children independently predict the tile split before seeing it. AI shows the split to confirm.
- `voice_recorder` (secondary): Record a child saying all three phonemes of a CVC word slowly, play it back. "Can you hear three sounds? That's three phonemes."
- `multi_choice_2`: Consolidation questions choosing between two GPCs — which grapheme makes this phoneme?

**Differentiation:**
- Support: Focus only on the two keystone concepts (phoneme, GPC). Grapheme recognition is tested separately. Provide a three-picture reference card: ear (phoneme), pencil (grapheme), arrow linking them (GPC).
- Core: All three concepts as above.
- Challenge: Ask child to generate their own example of a GPC not used in the lesson. "Can you think of a sound and its written shape that we haven't talked about today?"

## Assessment and Feedback

### Checking for understanding

**Keystone concepts to gate:** Phoneme (`EN-KS1-C001`) and GPC (`EN-KS1-C003`) are both marked as keystone concepts in the graph. These are the ones to assess with rigour before moving to `CL002`. A child who is unsure of what a phoneme *is* will have systematic difficulties throughout KS1 reading. Grapheme (`EN-KS1-C002`) is important but slightly less foundational — children who can manipulate phonemes and GPCs will pick up the grapheme vocabulary more naturally.

**Formative checks to use throughout the cluster:**

| What to check | How to check | What a secure answer looks like |
|---|---|---|
| Can child identify phonemes in a spoken word? | Say a CVC word; ask child to count sounds on fingers | 3 fingers for 'cat', 3 for 'ship' (not 4) |
| Can child match phoneme to grapheme? | Show grapheme flashcard; ask for phoneme | Immediate, clean phoneme — not 'buh', but /b/ |
| Does child understand GPC as a relationship? | "What does GPC mean in your own words?" | Any response linking sound to written letter(s) |
| Does child count phonemes vs letters? | Write 'ship' on board; ask how many sounds | Child says 3, not 4 |

**Exit task (end of lesson 4):** Give each child 3 picture cards. Say three words. Child holds up the correct number of fingers for each phoneme count. Teacher ticks against a simple checklist. This takes 2 minutes and gives you a class-level readiness picture for `CL002`.

### Feedback language

The feedback profile for Year 1 specifies **informational celebratory** feedback with a **warm, nurturing** tone. Follow this precisely. The phrases below model the correct register.

**Correct answer — describe the action specifically:**
- "You heard all three sounds in 'cat' — /c/ /a/ /t/ — you counted them on your fingers perfectly!"
- "You matched the /sh/ sound to the letters s and h. You cracked that part of the code!"
- "You split 'ship' into three pieces — [sh] [i] [p] — that is exactly right."

These are modelled on the feedback profile example: *"The frog jumped exactly four spaces — you counted perfectly!"* — note how it names the specific action, not a general judgement.

**Incorrect answer — redirect without evaluation:**
- "Oh, let us listen to that word together one more time. Ready? /sh/... /i/... /p/. Can you hear the first sound?"
  *(This is the profile's example phrasing: "Oh, let us count again together!")*
- "Let us look at that tile again — is this one tile or two?"
  *(Animation in AI session demonstrates the correct answer visually.)*

**Phrases that must NOT be used (from FeedbackProfile avoid_phrases):**
- "Wrong" — never
- "Incorrect" — never
- "That is not right" — never
- "Try again" — never
- **"Well done"** — avoid; it is evaluative rather than informational. Use specific descriptions instead.

Note: "Well done" feels natural but the profile explicitly flags it. Replace with "You did it" followed by the specific thing they did.

**On explicit misconception correction:** The feedback profile specifies that misconception correction should be kept **implicit** for Year 1. Do not say "You made a mistake because you confused letters with sounds." Instead: redirect visually or through a new worked example. Let the correct model do the work, not the correction.

**Metacognitive reflection:** The profile specifies this is **not yet appropriate** for Year 1. Do not ask "How did you know that?" or "What strategy did you use?" — this is appropriate from Year 3 onwards. At Year 1, the cognitive load of metacognitive questioning is counterproductive.

**Unexpected delight:** The profile marks this as **safe and recommended (frequent)** for Year 1. Use playful moments: "Oh, the letters are hiding together! Let us find them." Sound effects, animations, brief moments of surprise — these are appropriate and welcomed at this stage.

**Gamification note:** The profile marks gamification as **not safe** for Year 1. No points, stars, badges, streaks, or progress bars in any AI session. Motivation comes from the intrinsic pleasure of cracking the code and from the teacher's warm, specific feedback.

## Adaptive Learning Notes (for the AI System)

These notes translate the learner profile and pedagogical guidance into directives for the AI session design.

### Content and display rules

- **TTS required: Yes.** Every text element must have audio attached. No question or instruction should appear as text only. The child cannot decode independently.
- **Maximum one concept per screen.** Do not mix 'what is a phoneme?' and 'what is a grapheme?' on the same screen interaction.
- **Maximum sentence length: 8 words.** Check all AI-generated instructions.
- **Avoid negatives.** Do not say "which is NOT a grapheme." Say "which one makes the /s/ sound?" — a positive framing.
- **Use only familiar referents.** Animals, food, toys, family members. Not abstract images or unusual vocabulary. 'Ship' is fine — it is a common picture-book word. 'Chauffeur' is not.
- **Academic vocabulary: avoid.** The child does not see the words 'phoneme' or 'grapheme' on screen as text to read. These are spoken vocabulary items.

### Struggling pupil — adaptation paths

**If a child cannot identify any phonemes (no phonological awareness):**
Stop the phoneme content. Switch to `voice_input` with oral rhyming tasks: "Does 'cat' rhyme with 'bat'?" This is Phase 1 activity. Flag to the class teacher for parallel Phase 1 support. Do not continue phoneme identification tasks.

**If a child counts letters not phonemes consistently:**
Remove all written words from view. Work entirely in audio. Use `voice_input` for oral phoneme counting only. Reintroduce Phoneme Splitter only when oral counting is secure. The mismatch between tile count and letter count in the Phoneme Splitter is diagnostic here.

**If a child cannot match phoneme to grapheme (GPC breakdown):**
Return to the worked example phase. Display one grapheme with its anchor image (from the phonics scheme). Say the phoneme. Ask child to say it back using `voice_input`. Then present `multi_choice_2` with only two options: the correct grapheme and a clearly different one. Build the pairing slowly before widening the choice set.

### Hint tiers (max 2 per question — do not exceed)

The pedagogy profile specifies a maximum of 2 hint tiers. Use them in this order:

| Tier | What to do |
|---|---|
| Hint 1 | Replay the spoken phoneme. Add a mouth-movement animation showing how the sound is made. |
| Hint 2 | Show the answer — animated and narrated. Child taps to confirm. "Let us find it together — there it is: /sh/ is 'sh'." |

Do not use a third hint. After hint 2, reveal the answer with the animation and move on. Dwelling on failure is counterproductive at this stage.

### Spaced retrieval

The pedagogy profile sets a **spacing interval of 1–3 days**. Structure the AI session sequence as:

- Session 1 (Day 1): Phoneme concept — worked example + immediate practice
- Session 2 (Day 2–3): Grapheme concept — worked example + retrieval of phoneme from Day 1
- Session 3 (Day 3–4): GPC — worked example + retrieval of phoneme and grapheme
- Session 4 (Day 4–6): Consolidation — retrieval across all three concepts before assessment

Do not compress all four sessions into one day. The 1–3 day gap is the mechanism that produces retention, not just exposure.

### Session endings

Every session must end positively — this is a direct instruction from the pedagogy profile. Even if the child has struggled, the final moment should be a successful action. Design sessions so the last interaction is always one the child can get right (e.g., a single, familiar GPC match). End with an informational celebration: "You listened to sounds today — that's phonics."

## Resources and Preparation

**Classroom materials:**
- Phonics flashcard set (graphemes with anchor images from your school's scheme — Letters and Sounds, Read Write Inc., Jelly and Bean, or equivalent)
- Word cards for CVC and CCVC words with phoneme dot marking (coloured dots under each grapheme, not each letter)
- Large display: grapheme-phoneme correspondence chart (posted in the classroom, referenced in every session)
- Mini-whiteboards and pens for guided practice arcing activities
- Picture cards for oral phoneme counting (10–15 everyday objects: sun, cat, dog, hat, pig, fish, cup, bed, frog, shop)
- Hand mirrors (optional, for pure phoneme production work in Lesson 1)

**For AI sessions:**
- Ensure TTS is enabled and tested before the session
- `phoneme_splitter` interaction: pre-load with the word set for the lesson. Confirm digraphs are loading as single tiles (sh, ch, th — each one tile, not two)
- `multi_choice_2` questions: use images not text for both options wherever possible
- `voice_input`: accept phonetic approximations for subject vocabulary (e.g., if child says 'fuh-neem' for 'phoneme', accept it)
- No progress indicators, points, or badges configured in the session

**Teacher preparation:**
- Read through the common misconceptions section before lesson 1. Predict which children are most likely to count letters rather than sounds (children who are very print-aware sometimes have this confusion).
- Review your school's phonics programme sequence to confirm which GPCs are being taught in parallel — this cluster provides the conceptual framework; the GPCs themselves are introduced through the programme's ordered set.
- Prepare a simple observation checklist: one row per child, columns for each of the five learning objectives. Use ticks and brief notes, not grades.

## Links to Next Learning

**Immediate next step: `EN-KS1-D002-CL002`** — Assessment: Phoneme, Grapheme, GPC
This is a short assessment cluster that checks whether the three concepts are secure enough to proceed. Children who have completed all four lessons and the exit task above should be ready. Children who cannot consistently count phonemes in 3-phoneme words or cannot match a phoneme to its grapheme need additional time in this cluster before moving forward.

**Once past the assessment gate: `EN-KS1-D002-CL003`** — Blend and Segment Sounds to Decode and Spell
This cluster applies the conceptual knowledge built here. Children will now use their understanding of phonemes and GPCs to actually read and spell words. Everything in CL001 was building toward this application. CL003 will feel immediately accessible to children who genuinely understand GPC — and will feel broken to children who do not.

**Later in the domain:**
- `CL005` — Recognise vowel and consonant digraphs and split digraphs: builds directly on the digraph seed planted in Lesson 3
- `CL006` — Common exception words: the contrast with decodable words only makes sense once GPCs are understood
- `CL008` — Consolidation of digraph types: returns to this cluster's vocabulary for deep review

**Cross-domain link:** As children begin to write (Writing domain), they will apply GPC knowledge to encode — spelling is GPC in reverse. The vocabulary and concepts established here will be named again in the writing programme. Make the link explicit when it arises: "Remember the phoneme and grapheme? Now we're going the other way."
