# Lesson Context: Understand phonemes, graphemes and their correspondence

> **Cluster**: `EN-KS1-D002-CL001` | Type: introduction | ⭐ Keystone cluster ✓ Curated

## Overview

- **Subject**: English
- **Year group**: Y1 (None)
- **Domain**: Reading - Word Reading (`EN-KS1-D002`)
- **Estimated teaching time**: 4 lessons (~1.3 weeks)
- **Modelled on**: CC ELA RF.1.2 - Phonological Awareness; RF.1.3 - Phonics and Word Recognition

### Pedagogical rationale

Phoneme, grapheme and GPC are the conceptual bedrock of systematic phonics; all three are mutually co-taught (C002 lists C001 and C003), and none is meaningful without the others.

## Curriculum context

Reading — word reading at KS1 focuses on teaching children the alphabetic code systematically through phonics, enabling them to decode unfamiliar words independently. Children learn the correspondences between sounds (phonemes) and letters or groups of letters (graphemes), applying this knowledge to blend sounds in order to read words and segment words for spelling. The statutory curriculum requires that by the end of Year 1, children pass the statutory Phonics Screening Check, demonstrating secure knowledge of the common grapheme-phoneme correspondences. In Year 2, pupils consolidate their phonic knowledge and develop fluency in reading high-frequency words and common exception words. The goal of word reading is automaticity — reading words accurately without conscious effort — which frees pupils' cognitive resources for comprehension.

## Concepts in this cluster (3)

### Phoneme ⭐ **keystone**
*`EN-KS1-C001` · knowledge · complexity 1 · weight 1*

The smallest unit of sound in spoken language (e.g., /c/ /a/ /t/)

**Teaching guidance:** Teach phonemes through a systematic synthetic phonics programme (e.g., Letters and Sounds, Read Write Inc.). Begin with single-letter phonemes (/s/, /a/, /t/, /p/) before progressing to digraphs and trigraphs. Use oral segmenting games — say a word slowly and ask children to count the sounds on their fingers. Ensure children understand that a phoneme is a sound, not a letter, by demonstrating words where one sound is represented by more than one letter.

**Key vocabulary:** phoneme, sound, letter, mouth, listen, say, hear, word

**Common misconceptions:** Children often confuse phonemes with letters, believing that each letter always makes one sound. They may count letters rather than sounds when segmenting (e.g., thinking 'ship' has four sounds instead of three). Some children add a schwa sound to consonant phonemes (e.g., saying 'buh' instead of /b/).

### Grapheme
*`EN-KS1-C002` · knowledge · complexity 1 · weight 1*

A letter or group of letters representing a phoneme (e.g., 'sh', 'ch', 'igh')

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce graphemes alongside phonemes from the start of systematic phonics teaching. Use flashcards showing the grapheme with a picture cue (e.g., 'sh' with a picture of a ship). Teach children that a grapheme can be one letter (s), two letters (sh, ch, th), or three letters (igh, ear). Practise matching graphemes to phonemes using phoneme frames and magnetic letters. Display grapheme charts in the classroom for reference.

**Key vocabulary:** grapheme, letter, digraph, trigraph, sound, write, spell, read

**Common misconceptions:** Children may think that every letter is a separate grapheme, leading them to split digraphs incorrectly when reading (e.g., reading 'sh' as /s/ /h/). They may struggle to understand that the same phoneme can be represented by different graphemes (e.g., /ee/ can be 'ee', 'ea', 'e-e').

### Grapheme-Phoneme Correspondence (GPC) ⭐ **keystone**
*`EN-KS1-C003` · knowledge · complexity 2 · weight 2*

The relationship between letters and the sounds they represent

**Teaching guidance:** Teach GPCs in a systematic order following the school's chosen phonics programme. Start with one-to-one correspondences (one letter, one sound) before introducing alternatives. Use a 'speed sounds' routine where children see the grapheme and say the phoneme rapidly. Revisit GPCs daily through flashcard practice. When children encounter a new GPC in reading, explicitly name it and add it to the class phonics display.

**Key vocabulary:** grapheme-phoneme correspondence, sound, letter, match, phonics, code, alphabetic code

**Common misconceptions:** Children often assume each letter makes only one sound and become confused when they encounter alternative pronunciations (e.g., 'c' in cat vs city). They may not realise that English has more phonemes (approximately 44) than letters (26), requiring some sounds to be represented by letter combinations.

## Learner profile

### Content & language guidelines

- **Reading level**: Most children are in phonics stages 2–5. Cannot decode independently. All content must be supported by audio.
- **Max sentence length**: 8 words
- **TTS required**: Yes
- **Academic vocabulary**: Avoid

> **AI content instruction**: Do not display text to child without audio. All questions must be spoken aloud. Use only objects the child knows from everyday life (animals, food, toys, family). Maximum one concept per screen. Avoid negatives ('which is NOT...') — rephrase as positives.

### Pedagogy profile

- **Session length**: 5–12 minutes
- **Scaffolding**: maximum
- **Productive failure**: Not yet — worked examples first
- **Hint tiers**: max 2
- **Spacing interval**: 1–3 days
- **Session sequence**: worked_example → guided_practice → retrieval_practice
- **Active desirable difficulties**: 

> **AI pedagogy instruction**: Always start with a fully narrated worked example showing the complete answer. Then immediately practise with the same type of problem. No challenge problems before instruction — Y1 children need success to build confidence. Keep each concept isolated; do not mix topics within a session. End every session positively.

### Feedback profile

- **Style**: informational_celebratory
- **AI tone**: warm_nurturing
- **Gamification**: ⚠ Not safe — avoid
- **Unexpected delight**: Safe ✓ (frequent)
- **Explicit misconception correction**: Keep implicit
- **Metacognitive reflection**: Not yet
- **Example (correct)**: "The frog jumped exactly four spaces — you counted perfectly!"
- **Example (incorrect)**: "Oh, let us count again together! [animation demonstrates]"
- **Avoid phrases**: "Wrong", "Incorrect", "That is not right", "Try again", "Well done"

> **AI feedback instruction**: Describe what the child did specifically, not how they performed. Avoid evaluative praise ('Well done!'). Use informational celebration ('You matched all five pictures!'). On error: never say wrong — redirect: 'Let us look again together.' Post-error correction is visual/animated only. No points, badges, or progress bars of any kind.

### Interaction types available

**Primary (preferred):**
- **Voice Input** (`voice_input`, input)
  > Use single voiced questions only. Do not display the question text — speak it. Provide visual microphone affordance. Confirm transcription back before evaluating. Accept phonetic approximations for subject vocabulary.
- **Drag and Drop — Place on Target** (`drag_drop_place`, manipulation)
  > Use when placement reveals understanding (e.g., ordering on number line, sorting into Venn diagram). Items should be clearly distinguishable by colour/shape. Limit to 6 draggable items maximum per screen for Y1-Y3.
- **Number Line — Drag Marker** (`number_line_scrubber`, maths_tool)
  > Specify the number range and expected precision (integer, 0.5, 0.1, fraction). For fractions, display both the fractional position and decimal equivalent below the line. Use after teaching formal notation to reinforce conceptual placement.
- **Multiple Choice — 2 Options** (`multi_choice_2`, selection)
  > Offer exactly 2 options. Both should be meaningfully plausible — avoid obvious distractors. Use images rather than text where possible. Frame as a binary distinction (odd/even, living/non-living, more/less than).
- **Letter Toggler (Tap to Cycle)** (`letter_toggler`, specialist)
  > Use for letter recognition and case discrimination tasks only. Present a row of tiles and ask child to tap to match a target pattern: 'Make the letters in a name show their capital form.' Do not use for phoneme discrimination — use phoneme_splitter for that. Do not use for word-building — use sentence_assembly for that. Most appropriate for Y1 letter knowledge and Y2 capitalization rules. Keep tasks concrete: 'Find the letter that starts your name.'
- **Phoneme Splitter** (`phoneme_splitter`, specialist)
  > Display the target word as phoneme-block tiles. Ask child to drag them apart: 'Can you split this word into its sounds?' Tap each block in sequence to hear the phoneme chain, then drag together and tap to hear the blend. Build from known phonemes: start with the vowel identification task. Use after initial sound exposure, not as first contact with a phoneme. Do not split digraphs (sh, ch, th) — keep them as single tiles.

**Secondary (available):**
- Voice Recorder — Record and Playback (`voice_recorder`, input)
- Multiple Choice — 3 Options (`multi_choice_3`, selection)
