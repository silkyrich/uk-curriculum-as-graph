# Lesson Context: Understand place value, negative numbers and order real numbers

> **Cluster**: `MA-KS3-D004-CL001` | Type: introduction |  ✓ Curated

## Overview

- **Subject**: Mathematics
- **Year group**: Y7 (None)
- **Domain**: Number (`MA-KS3-D004`)
- **Estimated teaching time**: 5 lessons (~1.7 weeks)
- **Modelled on**: CC Math 6.NS.C.6 - Understand a rational number as a point on the number line; apply to all four quadrants

### Pedagogical rationale

Place value with decimals, negative integers, ordering real numbers and inequality symbols all co-teach together (C001, C003, C004 mutually link; C003 co-teaches with C002 and C004). These form the foundational number system cluster.

## Curriculum context

Number at KS3 extends the primary number system to formal work with integers, fractions, decimals, percentages and the relationships between them. Pupils develop fluency with all four operations applied to negative numbers, fractions, mixed numbers and decimals, and are introduced to index notation and standard form for very large and very small quantities. The use of number theory concepts such as prime factorisation, highest common factor and lowest common multiple underpins later work in algebra and fractions. Pupils consolidate their understanding of ordering and magnitude, and develop systematic approaches to checking the reasonableness of answers through estimation and approximation.

## Concepts in this cluster (4)

### Place value with decimals
*`MA-KS3-C001` · knowledge · complexity 1 · weight 1*

Understanding the value of digits in decimal numbers and extending place value beyond whole numbers

**Teaching guidance:** Begin with place value charts that extend into tenths, hundredths and thousandths, connecting to primary place value understanding. Use base-10 blocks or Dienes apparatus to show that the pattern of ×10 and ÷10 continues either side of the decimal point. Ask pupils to place decimals on number lines with progressive levels of zoom — first between 0 and 1, then between 3.4 and 3.5. Link decimal place value to measurement contexts (metres/centimetres, litres/millilitres) where the decimal point separates whole units from sub-units.

**Key vocabulary:** decimal, decimal place, tenths, hundredths, thousandths, place value, digit, column, decimal point, magnitude, base ten

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often believe that 0.45 is greater than 0.8 because 45 > 8 (the 'longer is larger' error). Some pupils treat digits after the decimal point as a separate whole number. Others think there is a 'oneths' column immediately after the decimal point. Using place value charts with explicit column headings corrects these errors.

### Negative integers
*`MA-KS3-C002` · knowledge · complexity 1 · weight 1*

Understanding and working with numbers less than zero

**Teaching guidance:** Use vertical number lines (thermometers) as the primary model, then progress to horizontal number lines with zero clearly marked. Present negative numbers in real contexts: temperature, sea level (above/below), bank balances (credit/debit), and lifts going below ground. Emphasise that negative numbers continue infinitely and that the further left (or down) you go, the smaller the value. Use physical movement along a number line — stepping left for subtraction, right for addition — to build intuition before formalising rules.

**Key vocabulary:** negative, positive, integer, directed number, zero, below zero, above zero, minus, number line, origin, absolute value

**Common misconceptions:** The most common error is thinking -8 > -3 because 8 > 3. Pupils also confuse the minus sign as an operation with its use as a direction indicator. Some pupils believe zero is a negative number. Address these by consistently returning to the number line and asking 'which is further left?'

### Ordering real numbers
*`MA-KS3-C003` · skill · complexity 2 · weight 2*

Comparing and ordering positive and negative integers, decimals and fractions using number line models

**Teaching guidance:** Provide sorting activities where pupils order sets of mixed numbers — positive and negative integers, fractions and decimals — on a blank number line. Convert all numbers to the same form (e.g., all to decimals) as a checking strategy. Use card sorts where pupils physically arrange values. Progress to more abstract comparisons using inequality symbols. Emphasise that fractions and decimals can be negative, and practise ordering sets like -0.5, -¾, 0.3, -1.

**Key vocabulary:** order, compare, ascending, descending, number line, inequality, greater than, less than, equal to, integer, decimal, fraction, rational number

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils frequently order negative fractions and decimals incorrectly because they apply positive-number reasoning. For example, they may place -¼ before -½ on a number line. Some pupils believe all fractions are between 0 and 1. Consistent use of the number line as a visual anchor helps pupils self-correct.

### Inequality symbols
*`MA-KS3-C004` · knowledge · complexity 1 · weight 1*

Using and interpreting =, ≠, <, >, ≤, ≥ symbols correctly

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce inequality symbols through concrete comparison activities before formalising notation. Use the 'crocodile mouth' analogy from primary but progress quickly to formal mathematical language. Present inequalities as statements that can be true or false, and ask pupils to evaluate statements like 3 < 5, -2 > -7, 0.3 ≤ 0.30. Connect to number line work: the symbol always points towards the smaller value (further left on the number line). Practise reading inequalities both ways: '3 < 5' reads as '3 is less than 5' or '5 is greater than 3'.

**Key vocabulary:** equals, not equal to, less than, greater than, less than or equal to, greater than or equal to, inequality, symbol, statement, ≠, <, >, ≤, ≥

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often confuse < and > because both look similar. Some pupils read a < b as 'a is greater than b' if they read left-to-right without attending to the symbol direction. The distinction between < and ≤ is also poorly understood — pupils may not appreciate that ≤ includes equality.

### Interaction types available

**Primary (preferred):**
- **Compare and Contrast Table** (`compare_contrast_table`, higher_order)
  > Pre-populate comparison criteria (rows) — do not ask child to identify criteria at Y5; provide them. Y6+ can be given blank criteria rows to identify. After completion, prompt: 'Looking at your table, what is the most important difference?' to prompt synthesis beyond recall.
- **Inference Task — Socratic Questioning** (`inference_task`, higher_order)
  > Question sequence: (1) What do you notice / see? (2) What does that tell you? (3) Why do you think that? (4) What would need to be different for your answer to change? Never affirm or deny until the end of the chain. Final step: 'You inferred [X] correctly because [Y] — the text didn't say it directly, but the clues were [Z].'
- **Text Annotation — Add Comment** (`text_annotation`, reading_tool)
  > Use for PEE (Point, Evidence, Explain) structures. Scaffold with column headers: 'What does this word suggest?' / 'What is the effect on the reader?'. Show annotations from a model reader alongside child's own for comparison.
- **Text Highlight and Select** (`text_highlight`, reading_tool)
  > Instruct child to highlight specific evidence before asking them to explain it. 'Find the part of the text that tells you [X]'. After highlight, ask: 'Why does that part of the text show us [X]?' Multiple colours allow tracking evidence, vocabulary, and inference clues separately.
- **Multiple Choice — 4 Options** (`multi_choice_4`, selection)
  > 1 correct answer + 3 distractors. Each distractor should address a specific, documented misconception from the curriculum domain. Explain why the distractor is wrong in post-answer feedback.
- **Multiple Choice — 5 Options (with None/All)** (`multi_choice_5`, selection)
  > Use when curriculum content warrants nuanced discrimination. 'None of the above' is a high-cognitive-demand option — use selectively, not as a default filler. Confirm the distractor set addresses documented misconceptions.
- **Text Input — Full Sentence** (`text_input_sentence`, text_input)
  > Evaluate sentence for meaning, not surface grammar. Provide a structural scaffold prompt if blank after 30 seconds: 'Try starting with [X] because...' or 'I think [X] because [Y]'. In feedback, show a model answer alongside the child's response.
- **Text Input — Paragraph** (`text_input_paragraph`, text_input)
  > Structure evaluation around: claim (present?), evidence (cited?), reasoning (logical?). Use a 3-point rubric internally. Feedback should address each dimension. Do not focus on spelling or grammar unless that is the assessed skill.

**Secondary (available):**
- Voice Input (`voice_input`, input)
- Drag to Categorise (`drag_categorise`, manipulation)
- Drag to Reorder (`drag_reorder`, manipulation)
- Matching Pairs (`matching_pairs`, manipulation)
- Code Input (`code_input`, text_input)
