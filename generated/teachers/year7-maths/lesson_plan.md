## 1. At a Glance

This cluster consolidates and formalises pupils' KS2 understanding of place value and negative numbers, then extends both ideas to cover the full real number line — including negative decimals and negative fractions. It closes the unit by formalising inequality notation, giving pupils precise symbolic language for comparisons they have been making intuitively since primary school.

Year 7 is the right moment for this work for two reasons. First, pupils arrive from KS2 with highly variable foundations: some can confidently order decimals to three places and perform calculations across zero; others carry persistent misconceptions (notably the "longer decimal is larger" error and the "–8 is bigger than –3 because 8 is bigger than 3" error) that were never corrected in KS2. A deliberate introductory cluster surfaces and resolves these before they propagate into fractions, ratio, and algebra. Second, KS3 immediately requires negative number arithmetic (CL004), prime factorisation with index notation (CL002), and eventually algebraic manipulation — all of which depend on a secure, flexible sense of the number line extending infinitely in both directions. This is the moment to build that security with mathematical precision rather than primary-school approximation.

---

## 2. Curriculum Context

**What KS2 built**

By the end of Year 6, the National Curriculum requires pupils to:
- Read, write, order and compare numbers up to 10,000,000 and determine the value of each digit
- Round any whole number to a required degree of accuracy
- Use negative numbers in context, and calculate intervals across zero
- Identify the value of digits in decimals to three decimal places
- Order and compare positive and negative integers, decimals and fractions

In practice, attainment against these objectives varies enormously at secondary transition. Place value with decimals is generally the most securely held. Negative number ordering is the most fragile — KS2 teaching often centres on temperature and counting back, which does not generalise robustly to ordering negative fractions or performing arithmetic.

**What this cluster formalises**

- Extends place value explicitly to tenths, hundredths and thousandths using the multiplicative ×10/÷10 structure, connecting to measurement and to standard form later (CL005)
- Establishes the number line model as the canonical reference tool for the entire number system — not just for whole numbers or positive decimals
- Introduces negative fractions and negative decimals as positions on that number line
- Gives pupils formal inequality notation: =, ≠, <, >, ≤, ≥, and practises reading and writing true/false statements

**What it leads to**

This cluster is the direct prerequisite for:
- **CL002** — Prime factorisation, HCF, LCM and index notation (requires secure understanding of integers)
- **CL004** — Operations with fractions, negative numbers, order of operations (requires fluency with the full number line)
- **KS3 Algebra** — Substitution into expressions with negative values; solving equations with negative solutions; coordinates in all four quadrants
- **KS3 Ratio and proportion** — Ordering and comparing fractional quantities
- **KS4** — Inequalities on a number line, error intervals (CL009/CL010), standard form (CL005)

---

## 3. Prerequisite Check

**Stated prerequisites (from the knowledge graph)**

- Place Value to 10,000,000 (MA-Y6-D001)
- Rounding to Any Degree of Accuracy (MA-Y6-D001)
- Negative Numbers and Calculating Intervals Across Zero (MA-Y6-D001)

**Diagnostic questions (5 minutes, written, before Lesson 1)**

Run these as a silent written exercise on entry. Do not discuss answers yet — use responses to sort pupils into support groupings.

| # | Question | What it surfaces |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Write the value of the digit 4 in the number 73.408 | Place value in decimals |
| 2 | Put these in order, smallest first: 0.7, 0.09, 0.75, 0.8 | "Longer is larger" misconception |
| 3 | Which is larger: –5 or –2? Explain your answer. | Negative number ordering + reasoning |
| 4 | The temperature at midnight is –6°C. By noon it is 9°C. How much has the temperature risen? | Calculating intervals across zero |
| 5 | True or false: –0.5 is smaller than –0.3. Explain. | Negative decimals (this is beyond KS2 — it is an extension probe) |

Questions 1–4 are strictly KS2 content. Question 5 is deliberately harder — it probes the specific new learning of this cluster. Pupils who answer Q5 correctly with a valid explanation may be ready to move more quickly to ordering mixed sets (C003) and can act as discussion partners in pair work.

---

## 4. Learning Objectives

By the end of this cluster, pupils will be able to:

1. **Recall and explain** the multiplicative structure of place value (×10/÷10) across the decimal point, stating the value of any digit in a decimal number up to three decimal places. *(Bloom: Remember/Understand — C001)*

2. **Represent and compare** negative integers and negative decimals on a number line, explaining why –7 < –2 with reference to position rather than magnitude. *(Bloom: Understand/Apply — C002)*

3. **Order** a mixed set of positive and negative integers, decimals and fractions from smallest to largest, using a number line and/or decimal conversion as a checking strategy. *(Bloom: Apply — C003)*

4. **Construct and evaluate** inequality statements using =, ≠, <, >, ≤, ≥, identifying whether a statement is true or false and correcting false statements. *(Bloom: Analyse/Evaluate — C004)*

5. **Justify** the ordering of a set of numbers by constructing a written mathematical argument, referencing position on the number line and the role of the negative sign as a direction indicator, not a magnitude. *(Bloom: Evaluate — C003/C004)*

---

## 5. Key Vocabulary

Introduce terms progressively across lessons, not all at once. Display on a working vocabulary board — not a static poster — adding terms as they are encountered.

| Term | Precise definition | Common confusion |
|---|---|---|
| **Decimal point** | The separator between the whole number part and the fractional part of a number | Pupils sometimes say "decimal" to mean any non-integer. Correct: all numbers have a decimal representation. The decimal point is the symbol; "decimal" describes a notation system. |
| **Tenths / Hundredths / Thousandths** | The column immediately to the right of the decimal point holds tenths (1/10), the next holds hundredths (1/100), the next thousandths (1/1000) | There is no "oneths" column. The first column to the right of the decimal point is tenths, not "ones-ths". Stress this explicitly. |
| **Place value** | The value of a digit determined by its position in a number | Pupils often say "the number 4" when they mean "the digit 4 in the hundredths column has a value of 0.04". Require precise language. |
| **Integer** | Any whole number: positive, negative, or zero | "Integer" is not the same as "positive number". Zero is an integer. Negative whole numbers are integers. |
| **Negative number** | A number less than zero. Written with a minus sign: –3 | The minus sign here is not an operation (subtraction). It is a direction indicator. –3 means "3 in the negative direction". This distinction is critical for C002 and for later arithmetic. |
| **Directed number** | Any number with a sign (positive or negative) that indicates direction on the number line | A broader term than "negative number". Reinforces the number line model. |
| **Absolute value** | The distance of a number from zero, regardless of direction. |–7| = 7 | Pupils confuse absolute value with value. –7 has an absolute value of 7 but a value of –7. Useful for explaining why –7 is further from zero than –2 even though –7 < –2. |
| **Origin** | The point zero on a number line | A formal term worth introducing early; it recurs in coordinates. |
| **Ascending / Descending** | Ascending: increasing in value (left to right on a number line). Descending: decreasing. | Pupils reverse these. A mnemonic: ascending = climbing up = getting bigger. |
| **Inequality** | A mathematical statement that compares two expressions using <, >, ≤, ≥, or ≠ | An inequality is not an equation. It does not have a single solution. 3 < 5 is a true statement about a relationship. |
| **Rational number** | A number that can be expressed as a fraction p/q where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0 | At Y7, use this term to name the set that includes integers, fractions, and decimals. Do not require pupils to prove rationality — use it descriptively. |

## 6. Common Misconceptions

These are documented in the knowledge graph and confirmed by research evidence. Address each explicitly — naming the misconception directly at Y7 is appropriate. Pupils this age respond well to being told "this is a mistake many mathematicians have to unlearn."

### Procedural misconceptions

**M1 — "Longer decimal is larger" (C001)**
Pupils compare 0.45 and 0.8 by reading 45 > 8, concluding 0.45 > 0.8.
Root cause: treating the digits after the decimal point as a separate whole number.
Fix: place value chart with explicit column headings. Ask pupils to write both numbers with the same number of decimal places (0.45 and 0.80) — the column-aligned comparison is then correct.

**M2 — "There is a 'oneths' column" (C001)**
Pupils list columns as: ..., thousands, hundreds, tens, ones, oneths, tenths...
Root cause: pupils construct the pattern by analogy with the left-hand side, but "ones" does not have a symmetric counterpart — the decimal point breaks the symmetry.
Fix: show the ×10/÷10 multiplicative structure using arrows: ones ÷10 = tenths, tenths ÷10 = hundredths. There is no "oneths" in this chain.

**M3 — Negative number ordering reversal (C002)**
Pupils say –8 > –3 because 8 > 3.
Root cause: pupils strip the sign and compare magnitudes. They have learned "bigger number = bigger value" and misapply it.
Fix: consistent return to the number line. Require pupils to mark both numbers on the line and ask "which is further left?" before making a comparison. Left = smaller, always.

**M4 — Confusing the minus sign as operation vs. direction indicator (C002)**
Pupils see –3 and read it as "minus 3" in the sense of "subtract 3", leading to confusion in expressions like –(–3).
Fix: establish early that –3 is a name (the number three in the negative direction). It is a label, not an instruction. Reserve "subtract" for the operation. Use "negative three" as the spoken form, not "minus three" where possible.

**M5 — Negative fractions treated as positive fractions with a sign awkwardly attached (C003)**
When ordering –¼ and –½, pupils place –¼ before –½ (further left) because ¼ < ½, without attending to the effect of the negative sign.
Root cause: pupils reason "¼ is smaller than ½, so –¼ is the smallest", not appreciating that the negative sign reverses the order.
Fix: convert to decimals (–0.25 and –0.5) and place on the number line. –0.5 is further left than –0.25, so –½ < –¼.

### Conceptual misconceptions

**M6 — Zero is a negative number (C002)**
Some pupils believe zero belongs to the negative side, possibly because it is "nothing" and they associate "nothing" with absence/negativity.
Fix: zero is the origin. It is neither positive nor negative. It is the boundary. Mark it explicitly on every number line.

**M7 — Confusing < and > (C004)**
Pupils reverse the symbols, particularly when the larger number is written first (e.g., 5 > 3 is written correctly, but 3 < 5 is written as 3 > 5).
Fix: the symbol always opens (points) towards the larger number, or alternatively always points (narrows) towards the smaller. Choose one consistent language and stick to it. The "crocodile eats the bigger number" analogy from KS2 is fine to mention and then replace with the formal description.

**M8 — "≤" means the same as "<" (C004)**
Pupils do not appreciate that ≤ includes the case of equality.
Fix: evaluate the statement 5 ≤ 5. Is it true? Yes. Evaluate 5 < 5. Is it true? No. The difference is one symbol but it changes the truth value of statements.

## 7. Lesson Sequence

The Y7 pedagogy profile specifies the session sequence: **challenge_problem → exploration → instruction → independent_practice → retrieval_practice → metacognitive_reflection**. This is productive failure pedagogy: pupils encounter a problem before they have been taught the full method. They will make errors. That is by design. The instruction phase is more effective when pupils have already struggled with the concept and can attach new information to their attempts.

Scaffolding is light at Y7. Worked examples are reference material, not the entry point. Retrieval practice applies to previously mastered content. Metacognitive reflection closes each session.

---

### Lesson 1 — Place Value with Decimals (C001)

**Objective**: Pupils can state the value of any digit in a decimal number up to three places, using the ×10/÷10 structure.

**Duration**: 40 minutes

---

**Phase 1: Challenge problem (8 minutes)**

Before any instruction, display the following problem. Pupils work individually in silence.

> "Here are five numbers: 0.3, 0.25, 0.307, 0.03, 0.299.
> A pupil says: 'The largest is 0.307 because 307 is the biggest number if you ignore the decimal point, and the smallest is 0.03 because 3 is smallest.'
> Is the pupil right? Write a full explanation of your answer. If they are wrong, explain what they did wrong."

Pupils write a response (text_input_paragraph interaction type). The AI system or teacher should not correct at this stage. Collect written responses and note which misconception patterns appear — particularly M1 (longer is larger) and M2.

**Phase 2: Exploration (7 minutes)**

Display a blank place value chart extending from millions to thousandths. Give no column headings. Ask pupils in pairs:
- "What pattern do you notice as you move left? As you move right?"
- "What do you think goes in the column immediately to the right of 'ones'? Why?"

Pairs share a brief answer. Record responses. Expect several to suggest "oneths." Do not correct yet — let the exploration run its course. This is the productive failure moment.

**Phase 3: Instruction (8 minutes)**

Now provide the column headings. Walk through the ×10/÷10 structure explicitly using arrows. Address M2 directly:

> "Several of you predicted 'oneths'. That's a reasonable pattern-based guess — the columns on the left are named by their multiplication (ten, hundred, thousand). But when we divide, we name by the fraction: one divided by ten is one-tenth. There is no 'oneths' column because 'one divided by one' just gives us ones again. The decimal point is where the pattern changes its naming system."

Write 73.408 on the board. For each digit: "What is its value? Not its digit — its value." (7 = seventy, 3 = three, 4 = four-tenths = 0.4, 0 = zero hundredths = 0.00, 8 = eight thousandths = 0.008.) Require pupils to state the value, not the digit.

Return to the challenge problem. Ask: "In light of what we have just done, reconsider the pupil's claim." Take responses.

**Phase 4: Independent practice (10 minutes)**

A set of 10 targeted questions, progressing in difficulty:

*Group A (consolidation):*
1. Write the value of the underlined digit: 4.**5**6 ; 0.3**0**9 ; 1**2**.47
2. Put in ascending order: 0.6, 0.06, 0.62, 0.6
3. Which is larger: 0.4 or 0.39? Explain using place value vocabulary.

*Group B (extension):*
4. A pupil says 1.5 = 1.50 = 1.500. Are they right? What do extra zeros after the last non-zero digit mean for place value?
5. Write three numbers between 0.3 and 0.4. Explain how you know they lie in that interval.
6. If you multiply 0.04 by 10 three times in a row, what do you get? Explain each step.

The AI system should use multi_choice_4 for Q1 (misconception-targeting distractors based on M1 and M2) and text_input_sentence for Q3 and Q5.

**Phase 5: Retrieval practice (5 minutes)**

Three questions on prior KS2 content (not today's material). Example: "What is 345 rounded to the nearest 10? Nearest 100? Write 0.7 as a fraction." This is retrieval only — no re-teaching. If pupils cannot answer, note for spaced re-exposure in 3–7 days.

**Phase 6: Metacognitive reflection (2 minutes)**

Write one sentence completing: "Before today I thought... but now I understand that..."
At Y7 the AI peer response to this is: "That shift from [what they wrote] to [the new understanding] is exactly what the place value structure reveals. The implication is: if that's true of decimals, what do you think it means for [next concept]?"

---

### Lesson 2 — Negative Integers (C002)

**Objective**: Pupils can position negative integers on a number line and explain ordering using positional reasoning rather than magnitude reasoning.

**Duration**: 40 minutes

---

**Phase 1: Challenge problem (7 minutes)**

> "A deep-sea submersible dives to a depth of –1,840 m. A second submersible is at –950 m. Which is deeper? Which has a greater depth in absolute terms?
>
> Here is a claim: '–1,840 is less than –950, yet –1,840 is deeper. How can a smaller number represent something further down?'
>
> Write a response to this claim."

This is deliberately paradox-framed to surface M3 and provoke genuine reasoning. Pupils use text_input_paragraph.

**Phase 2: Exploration (7 minutes)**

Provide a vertical number line from –20 to 20. Ask pupils to mark: –3, –11, 7, –7, 0, –0.5.
Ask: "What does the position of a number tell you about its value? What does position tell you that the digit alone does not?"

Collect answers. The key insight to draw out: position to the left (or down on a vertical line) means smaller value, regardless of what the digit says. Magnitude and value are different things.

**Phase 3: Instruction (8 minutes)**

Introduce "absolute value" formally. |–7| = 7. |7| = 7. Both are 7 units from zero. But –7 < 7 because –7 is to the left of 7 on the number line.

Address M3 and M4 directly. Say: "When I write –8, the minus sign is not an instruction to subtract. It is a label. It tells us this number lives to the left of zero, at a distance of 8. If I want to say subtract, I will use the word 'subtract' or put the operation in context. –8 is the name of a location."

Draw a horizontal number line. Demonstrate: –8 is further left than –3. Therefore –8 < –3. The fact that 8 > 3 tells us |–8| > |–3| — the absolute value is larger. But the value itself is smaller.

Address M6: "Zero is the origin. It is the dividing line between positive and negative. It is neither."

**Phase 4: Independent practice (10 minutes)**

*Group A:*
1. Mark these on a number line: –6, 2, –10, 0, –1. Write them in descending order.
2. Which is smaller: –3 or –9? Explain.
3. The temperature is –4°C. It drops 5 degrees. What is the new temperature? Mark both on a number line.
4. True or false (with explanation): "–12 > –4 because 12 > 4."

*Group B:*
5. Find a number n such that n < –5 and |n| < 10.
6. A and B are two numbers. A = –7, B = –2. Is |A| > |B|? Is A > B? What does this tell you about the relationship between a number's value and its absolute value?
7. Write three integers that satisfy: –10 < x < –4.

Use inference_task for Q2 and Q6 — run the Socratic question chain (What do you notice? What does that tell you? Why? What would need to be different?). Use multi_choice_4 for Q4 with distractors targeting M3.

**Phase 5: Retrieval practice (5 minutes)**

One question from Lesson 1 material: "Write the value of the digit 5 in the number 3.057." One question from a KS2 topic (e.g., factors of 36). One calculation question from primary: 7.3 + 0.08.

**Phase 6: Metacognitive reflection (3 minutes)**

Prompt: "What is the difference between a number's value and its absolute value? When does that difference matter?"
Y7 AI peer response: "That distinction — value vs. absolute value — is one of the conceptually hardest moves in this cluster. The implications run further than temperature: they show up in debt, in coordinates, and in the definition of distance. Can you think of a context where confusing them would cause a real problem?"

---

### Lesson 3 — Ordering Mixed Sets (C003)

**Objective**: Pupils can order a set containing positive and negative integers, decimals and fractions, using a number line and decimal conversion as verification strategies.

**Duration**: 40 minutes

This lesson has the highest conceptual load in the cluster. It synthesises C001 and C002 and introduces M5.

---

**Phase 1: Challenge problem (8 minutes)**

> "Order the following from smallest to largest. Show your method clearly.
>
> –1.5, –¾, 0.3, –0.25, ½, –1, 0"

Pupils work individually. Most will not yet know how to handle negative fractions. That is the point. Collect responses — especially note whether pupils place –¾ and –¼ correctly relative to each other.

**Phase 2: Exploration (8 minutes)**

Give each pupil (or pair) a blank number line from –2 to 2 and a set of card values: –1.5, –¾, 0.3, –0.25, ½, –1, 0. Physical card sort, then mark on the number line.

Key discussion questions:
- "Where does –¾ go? How did you decide?"
- "Is –¾ less than or greater than –0.25? How do you know?"
- "What strategy did you use to place the fractions?"

The goal is for pupils to discover (or be guided to discover) the conversion strategy: convert fractions to decimals to place them reliably.

**Phase 3: Instruction (8 minutes)**

Demonstrate the conversion strategy:
- –¾ = –0.75
- ½ = 0.5
- –0.25 is already decimal

Now the set is: –1.5, –0.75, 0.3, –0.25, 0.5, –1, 0
Order: –1.5, –1, –0.75, –0.25, 0, 0.3, 0.5

Address M5 directly: "Notice that –0.75 < –0.25. The fraction ¾ > ¼, but the negative reverses the order. Being further from zero in the negative direction means being smaller — not larger."

Formalise: on a number line, smaller values are always to the left. This is true for fractions, decimals, integers, and mixed sets.

A compare_contrast_table interaction type works well here: provide a table with columns "Positive version", "Negative version", "Which is smaller?" and rows for pairs like (¾, –¾), (0.25, –0.25), (2, –2). Pupils complete the table, then the synthesis question: "What rule does this table suggest about how the negative sign affects ordering?"

**Phase 4: Independent practice (10 minutes)**

*Group A:*
1. Order smallest to largest: –2, 1.5, –0.5, 0, –1.5, 2
2. Order smallest to largest: –½, –¼, 0.4, –0.3, 1
3. Write a number between –0.5 and –0.3.
4. Is –0.6 > –0.75? Justify your answer.

*Group B:*
5. Write a set of 5 numbers that are all negative and all lie between –2 and –1. Include at least one fraction and one decimal.
6. Mark on a number line: –1⅓, –⅔, –1.8. What do you notice about the order of –1⅓ and –⅔? Does it surprise you?
7. A number x satisfies –1 < x < –0.5. Give three possible values of x, including at least one fraction. Show all three on a number line.

Use text_input_sentence for Q4 and Q6 justifications. The AI feedback should engage with the reasoning structure: "Your claim is [X]. Your evidence is [Y]. Is that evidence sufficient on its own, or does your argument need to show why the negative sign changes the comparison?"

**Phase 5: Retrieval practice (4 minutes)**

One question from C001 (place value). One question from C002 (negative integer ordering). One KS2 question (equivalent fractions or rounding).

**Phase 6: Metacognitive reflection (2 minutes)**

"What strategy did you find most reliable for ordering a mixed set? What are its limitations — when might it be hard to apply?"

---

### Lesson 4 — Inequality Symbols (C004)

**Objective**: Pupils can write, read and evaluate inequality statements using all six symbols, including ≤ and ≥, and can identify whether a statement is true or false.

**Duration**: 40 minutes

---

**Phase 1: Challenge problem (5 minutes)**

Display four statements. Pupils write T (true) or F (false) for each, with a one-sentence justification:
1. –3 < –5
2. 0.4 ≤ 0.40
3. –¾ > –0.8
4. –2 ≥ –2

These are deliberately chosen to hit M7 (Q1, confusing direction), M8 (Q2 and Q4, confusing ≤ with <), and M5 (Q3). Most pupils will get at least one wrong. The errors guide the instruction.

**Phase 2: Exploration (5 minutes)**

Pupils compare answers in pairs. Where they disagree, they must justify their position without looking anything up. The goal is to surface disagreement before instruction.

**Phase 3: Instruction (12 minutes)**

Work through each of the four challenge statements systematically.

**Statement 1: –3 < –5**
Mark both on a number line. –3 is to the right of –5. Right = larger. So –3 > –5. The statement –3 < –5 is false. Address M7: "The symbol < always opens towards the larger value. –5 is smaller, so the symbol must point towards it: –5 < –3, or equivalently –3 > –5."

Introduce formal reading: "–3 > –5 reads as 'negative three is greater than negative five'." Practise reading both directions: "5 > 3 can also be read as 3 < 5 — the relationship is symmetric, but the symbol flips."

**Statement 2: 0.4 ≤ 0.40**
0.40 = 0.4. So this is comparing a number with itself. Is 0.4 = 0.4? Yes. Does ≤ include equality? Yes. So the statement is true. Address M8: "The ≤ symbol includes the equal case. 5 ≤ 5 is true. 5 < 5 is false. One symbol difference; different truth value."

**Statement 3: –¾ > –0.8**
Convert: –¾ = –0.75. Is –0.75 > –0.8? On the number line, –0.75 is to the right of –0.8. Right = larger. So yes, –0.75 > –0.8, so –¾ > –0.8 is true. Note: this is a case where counterintuitive reasoning (¾ > 0.8 as magnitudes, but in the negative domain the larger magnitude is the smaller value) resolves correctly only via number line.

**Statement 4: –2 ≥ –2**
Is –2 = –2? Yes. Does ≥ include equality? Yes. True.

Introduce ≠: 3 ≠ 5 (true). 3 ≠ 3 (false). Very quick — this symbol is the most straightforward.

**Phase 4: Independent practice (12 minutes)**

*Group A:*
1. Insert the correct symbol (<, >, =, ≤, ≥, ≠) between each pair:
   - 0.4 _ 0.39
   - –6 _ –4
   - –0.5 _ –½
   - 7 _ 7
2. Write a true inequality statement involving two negative numbers, using <.
3. Write a false inequality statement involving ≤. Then correct it.
4. For each statement, write True or False and explain: (a) –5 > –3; (b) 0 > –1; (c) –¼ < –½

*Group B:*
5. Write all integers n such that –3 ≤ n ≤ 1. (How many are there? Note that n = –3, –2, –1, 0, 1 — five integers including both endpoints.)
6. A number k satisfies k > –2 and k < 0. Write five possible values of k. Must k be an integer?
7. Is it possible for a number to satisfy both x < 3 and x > 4 simultaneously? Explain.

Use multi_choice_5 (with "None of the above" option) for Q1 compound — this is an appropriate high-demand use of that format at Y7. Use text_input_paragraph for Q7 — evaluate claim, evidence, reasoning.

**Phase 5: Retrieval practice (4 minutes)**

Question from C003 (order the set: –1, 0.5, –¾, –0.2, 2). Question from C001 (value of digit in a decimal). One KS2 multiplication question.

**Phase 6: Metacognitive reflection (2 minutes)**

"What is the difference between < and ≤? Write a pair of numbers where this difference changes whether a statement is true or false."

---

### Lesson 5 — Synthesis and Consolidation (C001–C004)

**Objective**: Pupils integrate all four concepts in multi-step problems and produce extended written mathematical arguments.

**Duration**: 40 minutes

---

**Phase 1: Challenge problem (10 minutes)**

Pupils work on a single extended problem:

> "A mathematician writes the following claim:
>
> 'On the number line, the number closest to zero is always the greatest. Therefore –0.01 is the greatest of all negative numbers.'
>
> Is this claim correct? Write a mathematical argument (5–8 sentences) that either defends or refutes the claim. Use at least three of the following: a number line sketch, an example with negative decimals, an example with negative fractions, at least one inequality statement using ≤ or ≥."

This is a text_input_paragraph task. It is genuinely open — pupils can write a strong argument either defending or refuting (the claim is actually both subtly right and wrong: closest to zero does mean largest negative number, but "–0.01 is the greatest of all negative numbers" is false because it is not the closest — 0 is not a negative number, and there are negative numbers between –0.01 and 0 such as –0.001).

**Phase 2: Peer critique (8 minutes)**

Pupils exchange written responses (or the AI system presents a model response alongside the pupil's). The task: "Identify the claim, the evidence, and the reasoning. Is the argument complete? What is missing?"

This is the compare_contrast_table interaction type: one column for the model argument, one for the pupil's, rows for "claim stated", "evidence given", "reasoning explicit", "number line used", "inequality used".

**Phase 3: Instruction — formalising the connection (7 minutes)**

Brief teacher-led synthesis connecting all four concepts:

1. Place value gives us precision in locating decimal numbers (how far from zero, in what direction).
2. Negative numbers extend the number line to the left of zero — and all the same rules of position apply.
3. Ordering any mixed set works the same way: position on the number line is the single, consistent reference.
4. Inequality symbols are the formal language for expressing those positional comparisons.

These four ideas are one idea: the number line is a model of all real numbers, and position is value.

**Phase 4: Independent practice (10 minutes)**

A mixed retrieval set across all four concepts and previous lessons:

1. Write the value of the digit 7 in 0.074.
2. Order: –2.5, –¾, –0.5, 0, –3.
3. Write a true inequality statement using ≥ where both sides are negative.
4. A temperature drops from 3°C to –8°C. Write an inequality statement comparing the two temperatures. How many degrees did it drop?
5. True or false: "There is no integer between –1 and 0." Justify.

Plus one interleaved question from the following week's content (CL002 preview): "What do you think the prime factors of 12 are? Have a guess before we study it next lesson."

**Phase 5: Retrieval practice (3 minutes)**

Questions from CL001 content only (all previous lessons). Not new material — this is the testing effect.

**Phase 6: Metacognitive reflection (2 minutes)**

"What is the single most important idea in this cluster? Write it in one sentence. Then write: what question does it not yet answer for you?"
This open reflection generates the spaced retrieval agenda for 3–21 days out.

## 8. Assessment and Feedback

### Formative assessment strategy

Distinguish between two different types of assessment need in this cluster:

**Conceptual understanding**: Can the pupil explain why –7 < –3 using the number line? Can they articulate the difference between value and absolute value? Can they evaluate an inequality statement as true or false with justification? These are tested through text_input_sentence and text_input_paragraph tasks. Look for reasoning, not just correct answers.

**Procedural fluency**: Can the pupil quickly and accurately order a mixed set, state digit values, and insert the correct symbol? These are tested through multi_choice_4 and short written exercises. Speed and accuracy both matter here, but procedural fluency without conceptual understanding is a fragile goal at KS3.

**Checks to run in each lesson:**
- Exit question: one retrieval question from the prior lesson (3-minute silent task). Scan responses before the next lesson to identify who needs re-exposure.
- Mid-lesson: informal read of text responses during independent practice. Stop the class if a misconception pattern is widespread — do not wait until the end.
- End of cluster: the Lesson 5 extended writing task serves as a holistic assessment of conceptual integration.

### Feedback language (Y7 FeedbackProfile)

The Y7 feedback profile specifies an **academic_peer** tone. This is a significant departure from KS2 or lower secondary conventions. The aim is to engage with the intellectual content of the pupil's argument, not to reward effort or celebrate completion.

**When correct:**
"Correct — and the implication is worth noting: if –0.75 < –0.25, then what does that tell us about the ordering of –¾ and –¼? Does the same logic hold for any two negative fractions?"

Not: "Well done!" or "Brilliant!" — these evaluate the person, not the idea.

**When incorrect:**
"That reasoning has a gap: you assumed that –8 > –3 because 8 > 3, but the evidence points the other way — on the number line, –8 is further left than –3, which means it is smaller. Revise your argument in light of the number line."

Not: "Wrong" (final, evaluative, unproductive). Not: "Nearly!" (imprecise, patronising at Y7).

**When partially correct:**
"Your claim is right (–¾ < –¼), but the reasoning needs strengthening. You said '¾ is bigger so the negative makes it smaller' — that is approximately right but it needs to be grounded in the number line: –¾ = –0.75, which sits to the left of –0.25 = –¼. Left means smaller. Can you revise your explanation to make that step explicit?"

**Phrases to avoid** (from the FeedbackProfile):
- "Wrong" — use "That reasoning has a gap" or "That claim is not supported by the evidence because..."
- "Amazing" — evaluates the person, not the thinking
- "Brilliant" — same problem
- "That is so clever" — same problem
- "Good try" — vague, patronising at Y7

**Metacognitive reflection prompts** (enabled for Y7):
- "Before we move on: what was the hardest part of that problem? What made it hard?"
- "If you were explaining negative fractions to a Year 5 pupil, what would you need them to understand first?"
- "You got that right — but could you have got there a different way? What other approach might work?"
- "You made an error earlier and corrected it. What did you notice that made you realise something was wrong?"

Metacognitive prompts at Y7 should treat the pupil as a learner who is becoming aware of their own reasoning process. They are not pastoral questions — they are intellectual ones.

## 9. Adaptive Learning Notes (for the AI System)

### Responding to specific misconceptions

**M1 (Longer decimal is larger):**
If detected, do not re-explain the full place value lesson. Insert a targeted question: "Write 0.8 with two decimal places. Now compare the two versions." If the pupil writes 0.80 and still claims 0.45 > 0.80, escalate to a place value chart interaction (drag_categorise with column headings) before returning to the comparison.

**M3 (Negative ordering by magnitude):**
If detected in a comparison task, immediately trigger an inference_task sequence:
1. "Mark –8 and –3 on this number line. Which is further left?"
2. "What does 'further left' tell you about the value?"
3. "Given that, revise your comparison."
Do not skip straight to the rule. The number line must be the mediating step.

**M5 (Negative fractions treated as positive fractions with a sign):**
Convert the fractions to decimals for the pupil as a scaffold: "Let me show you: –¾ = –0.75. Now compare –0.75 and –0.25 on the number line." After the pupil has succeeded with converted forms twice, return to the fraction form: "Now try –⅔ and –½ without converting first. Can you predict which will be smaller?"

**M7/M8 (Inequality symbol confusion):**
Use a compare_contrast_table: columns are "Symbol", "Includes equality?", "Example: 3 _ 5 (True?)", "Example: 5 _ 5 (True?)". Run this for all six symbols. If M8 persists, use a targeted multi_choice_5 question where the distractors include the < version of a ≤ statement to force the discrimination.

### Hint tier strategy (max 4 tiers, Y7)

The Y7 pedagogy profile allows up to 4 hint tiers. For this cluster:

**Tier 1** (after 90 seconds without progress): "Would a number line help here? Sketch one covering the range of numbers in the problem."

**Tier 2** (after further 90 seconds): "If any of these numbers are fractions, convert them to decimals. Once everything is a decimal, ordering works the same way."

**Tier 3** (after further 90 seconds): "Remember: on a number line, smaller values are always to the left. Which of these numbers is furthest left?"

**Tier 4** (after further 60 seconds): A worked parallel example — same structure, different numbers. Do not solve the original problem. Show the method, then return the pupil to the original. "Use the same approach on your problem."

Withhold Tier 1 until the pupil has made a genuine attempt. Do not offer hints for tasks the pupil is actively working through, even slowly.

### Spaced retrieval plan

The Y7 spacing interval is 3–21 days.

| Content | First spaced retrieval | Second spaced retrieval |
|---|---|---|
| Decimal place value (C001) | Lesson 3 exit question | 7–10 days after Lesson 5 (within CL002) |
| Negative integer ordering (C002) | Lesson 4 retrieval set | 14 days after Lesson 5 (during CL004 intro) |
| Ordering mixed sets (C003) | Lesson 5 retrieval set | 10–14 days after Lesson 5 |
| Inequality symbols (C004) | Interleaved in CL002 | Interleaved in CL004 and KS3 algebra intro |

Spaced retrieval questions should present the concept in a new context. Do not repeat identical questions. For C002 retrieval, use a context other than temperature (e.g., financial balance, elevation, golf scores relative to par).

### Desirable difficulties in use

The Y7 pedagogy profile specifies: spacing, interleaving, varied_practice, generation_effect, testing_effect.

**Spacing**: Applied via retrieval questions in each lesson drawing on prior lessons. Applied across the cluster sequence (C001 retrieval continues through Lessons 3–5).

**Interleaving**: Each lesson's retrieval set includes at least one question from a different KS2 domain (multiplication, fractions, rounding). From Lesson 3 onwards, ordering tasks include all four number types simultaneously rather than pure sets. In CL002, insert one inequality symbol question per lesson as interleaved retrieval.

**Varied practice**: The same concept (ordering negative numbers) is presented in multiple surface contexts: temperature, depth, finance, abstract number sets, number lines, card sorts, written justification. This prevents context-dependent learning.

**Generation effect**: Challenge problems before instruction force pupils to generate an approach before seeing the correct method. This is the productive failure structure. Pupils generate better (and more memorable) understanding of the correct method when they have first attempted their own.

**Testing effect**: Retrieval practice in Lessons 1–5 is retrieval-only — no re-reading, no notes. Pupils must generate the answer from memory. This applies only to content from previous lessons, not today's new material.

## 10. Resources

### Representations

- **Place value chart** (physical or digital): columns from millions to thousandths, with explicit column headings including the ×10/÷10 arrows. Print A3 for desk use in Lesson 1.
- **Number line from –10 to 10**: printed or drawn large on the board. Used in every lesson. Laminated personal versions for pupils are useful for annotation.
- **Vertical number line (thermometer format)**: Used specifically in Lesson 2 for the depth/temperature context. Vertical orientation reinforces "down = colder/lower = smaller value."
- **Card sort sets** (for Lesson 3): sets of 8–10 mixed numbers (positive/negative integers, decimals, fractions) printed on card for physical sorting. Laminated sets can be reused.

### Technology

- **Desmos Number Line** (teacher.desmos.com): excellent for live projection of number lines and for asking pupils to drag points to positions. Use for class discussion in Lessons 2 and 3.
- **AI adaptive practice system** (this project): interaction types as specified in the lesson sequence above — compare_contrast_table, inference_task, text_input_sentence, text_input_paragraph, multi_choice_4, multi_choice_5.
- **Mathigon / Polypad**: Number line tools with fraction and decimal support. Useful for independent exploration in Lesson 3.

### Practice sets

**Formative / low-stakes:**
- Diagnostic quiz (5 questions, written) — administered at start of Lesson 1
- Exit questions (1–2 questions per lesson) — not marked, scanned by teacher

**Summative / cluster assessment:**
- The Lesson 5 extended writing task is the primary cluster assessment for conceptual understanding
- A 15-question mixed set (covering C001–C004) can be administered as a formal cluster check in the first 15 minutes of CL002 Lesson 1

**Suggested external resources:**
- NCETM Calculation Guidance (KS3): Place value and directed number sections

## 11. Links to Next Learning

### Immediate: CL002 — Prime Factorisation, HCF, LCM and Index Notation

CL002 assumes secure integer understanding (C002 from this cluster). The concept of "factors" requires pupils to work comfortably with positive integers and to use inequality notation when comparing factor pairs. Spaced retrieval of inequality symbols should begin in CL002 Lesson 1.

### Medium-term: CL004 — Operations with Fractions, Negative Numbers, Order of Operations

CL004 directly extends C002 (negative integers) to arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of directed numbers. Pupils who hold M3 or M4 from this cluster will make predictable errors in CL004 (e.g., –3 – –5 = –8 because "two negatives make a positive double negative"). The number line model established here is the corrective tool.

### KS3 Algebra

- **Substitution**: Algebraic expressions with negative substituted values require secure understanding of directed numbers. A pupil who thinks –8 > –3 will evaluate 2n for n = –4 incorrectly.
- **Solving equations**: Solutions can be negative. "x = –3" is only meaningful if the pupil understands what –3 is.
- **Coordinates in all four quadrants**: The x and y axes are number lines. All four quadrants require negative number fluency. The inequality symbols from C004 are used to define quadrant membership.
- **Inequalities as a topic**: Representing inequalities on a number line (with open/closed circles) is a direct extension of C004, introducing the open/closed notation as the diagrammatic equivalent of < vs. ≤.

### KS3 Ratio and Proportion

- Ordering quantities and comparing rates requires the decimal ordering skills from C001 and C003. Pupils who cannot reliably compare 0.3 and 0.25 will struggle with unit rates.

### KS4

- **Error intervals (CL009)**: Bounds are written using inequality notation. A pupil must be able to write 3.45 ≤ x < 3.55 and understand what each symbol means.
- **Standard form (CL005)**: Understanding that 3.4 × 10^–2 = 0.034 requires fluency with the ×10/÷10 place value structure from C001.
- **Negative indices**: 10^–1 = 0.1 = 1/10. This is the C001 place value structure made algebraic.
