- **Estimated teaching time**: 12 lessons (~4.0 weeks)
- **Modelled on**: NGSS SEP 1 - Asking Questions; SEP 3 - Planning Investigations

### Pedagogical rationale

Questioning, prediction, variable identification and experimental design form the planning stage of any investigation; they are always taught together as a sequence. Co_teach_hints link C007 and C021.

## Curriculum context

Working scientifically at KS3 extends the enquiry skills developed in primary school to more rigorous, systematic and hypothesis-driven investigation. Pupils are expected to ask questions, make observations, design controlled experiments using independent, dependent and control variables, and analyse data quantitatively using means, ranges and graphical representations including scatter graphs. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to evaluate the reliability of their evidence, recognise sources of error and uncertainty, and communicate findings in written reports that distinguish between data and conclusions. KS3 pupils also learn to critically evaluate the work of others, reading and interpreting published scientific accounts, and understanding how scientific knowledge develops through peer review and replication. This domain underpins all science learning and its skills are applied throughout Biology, Chemistry and Physics.

## Concepts in this cluster (4)

### Scientific questioning
*`SC-KS3-C007` · skill · complexity 2 · weight 2*

Ability to ask meaningful scientific questions based on observations and prior knowledge

**Teaching guidance:** Model the process of turning a vague question into a testable scientific question. Start with broad observations (e.g., 'plants grow better in some places') and guide pupils to refine into specific, testable questions ('Does the amount of light affect the height of cress seedlings after 10 days?'). Use the Question Formulation Technique (QFT) to generate questions from stimulus material such as photographs or demonstrations.

**Key vocabulary:** scientific question, testable, hypothesis, observation, variable, measurable, enquiry, investigation, prediction, correlation, causal, qualitative, quantitative

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think any question is a scientific question — clarify that scientific questions must be testable through observation or experiment. Students may also confuse a question with a prediction — a question asks what might happen; a prediction states what you expect to happen based on reasoning.

### Scientific prediction
*`SC-KS3-C008` · skill · complexity 3 · weight 3*

Ability to make predictions based on scientific knowledge and understanding

**Teaching guidance:** Give pupils a set of scientific facts or principles and ask them to generate predictions for specific scenarios. For example, given knowledge of thermal conductivity, predict which material will allow an ice cube to melt fastest. Emphasise the difference between a guess and a scientific prediction — predictions must be justified using existing knowledge. Use 'I predict... because...' sentence frames to scaffold reasoning.

**Key vocabulary:** prediction, hypothesis, scientific knowledge, justify, reasoning, evidence, expected outcome, prior knowledge, extrapolation, trend, pattern, if...then...because

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think a prediction is just a guess — emphasise that a scientific prediction is based on existing knowledge and can be tested. Students also confuse predictions with hypotheses — a prediction is a specific statement about what will happen; a hypothesis is a proposed explanation for why.

### Variables in experiments
*`SC-KS3-C009` · knowledge · complexity 3 · weight 3*

Understanding and identifying independent, dependent, and control variables in scientific investigations

**Teaching guidance:** Use concrete examples across biology, chemistry and physics to identify the three variable types. For the classic 'effect of temperature on enzyme activity' experiment: independent variable = temperature, dependent variable = rate of reaction, control variables = enzyme concentration, substrate concentration, pH. Have pupils practise identifying variables from written scenarios before designing their own experiments. Use structured tables to organise variables.

**Key vocabulary:** independent variable, dependent variable, control variable, fair test, confounding variable, experimental design, hypothesis, measurement, categorical, continuous, discrete, operational definition

**Common misconceptions:** Students frequently mix up independent and dependent variables — the independent variable is what you deliberately change; the dependent variable is what you measure. The mnemonic 'I change the Independent, I observe the Dependent' can help. Students also sometimes think that only one control variable is needed — emphasise that all variables except the independent variable must be controlled.

### Experimental design
*`SC-KS3-C010` · skill · complexity 4 · weight 4*

Ability to plan and select appropriate types of scientific enquiries to test predictions

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce the five types of scientific enquiry: observing over time, pattern seeking, identifying and classifying, comparative fair testing, and research using secondary sources. Give pupils scenarios and ask them to select the most appropriate enquiry type. For fair tests, use a structured planning framework: question → prediction → variables → method → equipment → risk assessment. Practise designing experiments collaboratively before independent work.

**Key vocabulary:** experimental design, fair test, observation, pattern seeking, classification, comparative test, secondary source, methodology, controlled experiment, sample size, systematic, protocol, reliability, validity

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think the only type of scientific investigation is a fair test — clarify that observational studies, surveys, and pattern-seeking investigations are equally valid scientific approaches. Students may also design experiments with too many variables changing at once — emphasise that changing only one variable at a time is essential for a controlled experiment.

- **Session sequence**: challenge_problem → exploration → instruction → independent_practice → retrieval_practice → metacognitive_reflection
- **Active desirable difficulties**: spacing, interleaving, varied_practice, generation_effect, testing_effect

> **AI pedagogy instruction**: Secondary level productive failure. Challenge problems can be open-ended and multi-day. Worked examples as reference, not instruction. Metacognitive reflection standard after each session. Retrieval-only practice for mastered content. Interleave across KS3 topic strands.

### Feedback profile

- **Style**: academic_critical
- **AI tone**: academic_peer
- **Gamification**: ⚠ Not safe — avoid
- **Unexpected delight**: Safe ✓ (very_rare)
- **Explicit misconception correction**: Yes ✓
- **Metacognitive reflection**: Yes ✓
- **Example (correct)**: "Correct — and the implication is worth noting: if this is true, then [connected consequence] should also hold. Does it?"
- **Example (incorrect)**: "That reasoning has a gap: you assumed [X], but the evidence points the other way because [Y]. Revise your argument in light of that."
- **Avoid phrases**: "Wrong", "Amazing", "Brilliant", "That is so clever"

> **AI feedback instruction**: Academic feedback. Engage with argument quality: claim, evidence, reasoning. Identify specific logical gaps or unsupported assumptions. Metacognitive debrief standard. No performance praise — evaluate ideas, not the person.

### Interaction types available

**Primary (preferred):**
- **Compare and Contrast Table** (`compare_contrast_table`, higher_order)
  > Pre-populate comparison criteria (rows) — do not ask child to identify criteria at Y5; provide them. Y6+ can be given blank criteria rows to identify. After completion, prompt: 'Looking at your table, what is the most important difference?' to prompt synthesis beyond recall.
- **Inference Task — Socratic Questioning** (`inference_task`, higher_order)
  > Question sequence: (1) What do you notice / see? (2) What does that tell you? (3) Why do you think that? (4) What would need to be different for your answer to change? Never affirm or deny until the end of the chain. Final step: 'You inferred [X] correctly because [Y] — the text didn't say it directly, but the clues were [Z].'
- **Text Annotation — Add Comment** (`text_annotation`, reading_tool)
  > Use for PEE (Point, Evidence, Explain) structures. Scaffold with column headers: 'What does this word suggest?' / 'What is the effect on the reader?'. Show annotations from a model reader alongside child's own for comparison.
- **Text Highlight and Select** (`text_highlight`, reading_tool)
  > Instruct child to highlight specific evidence before asking them to explain it. 'Find the part of the text that tells you [X]'. After highlight, ask: 'Why does that part of the text show us [X]?' Multiple colours allow tracking evidence, vocabulary, and inference clues separately.
- **Multiple Choice — 4 Options** (`multi_choice_4`, selection)
  > 1 correct answer + 3 distractors. Each distractor should address a specific, documented misconception from the curriculum domain. Explain why the distractor is wrong in post-answer feedback.
- **Multiple Choice — 5 Options (with None/All)** (`multi_choice_5`, selection)
  > Use when curriculum content warrants nuanced discrimination. 'None of the above' is a high-cognitive-demand option — use selectively, not as a default filler. Confirm the distractor set addresses documented misconceptions.
- **Text Input — Full Sentence** (`text_input_sentence`, text_input)
  > Evaluate sentence for meaning, not surface grammar. Provide a structural scaffold prompt if blank after 30 seconds: 'Try starting with [X] because...' or 'I think [X] because [Y]'. In feedback, show a model answer alongside the child's response.
- **Text Input — Paragraph** (`text_input_paragraph`, text_input)
  > Structure evaluation around: claim (present?), evidence (cited?), reasoning (logical?). Use a 3-point rubric internally. Feedback should address each dimension. Do not focus on spelling or grammar unless that is the assessed skill.

**Secondary (available):**
- Voice Input (`voice_input`, input)
- Drag to Categorise (`drag_categorise`, manipulation)
- Drag to Reorder (`drag_reorder`, manipulation)
- Matching Pairs (`matching_pairs`, manipulation)
- Code Input (`code_input`, text_input)
