## At a Glance

- Pupils learn to distinguish between five types of scientific enquiry and select the most appropriate type for a given question — a foundational skill that underpins every practical investigation in KS2 and KS3.
- Fair testing and variable control are introduced through comparative tests first, then formalised: pupils explicitly name what they change, measure, and keep the same before any investigation begins.
- This is the right time to teach it because Y5 pupils have accumulated two years of substantive science content across biology, chemistry, and physics and are ready to reflect on *how* they know things — not just *what* they know.
- Working Scientifically is systematically under-taught as a discrete skill set; these lessons give pupils the metalanguage of enquiry they need to plan, evaluate, and communicate science independently throughout upper KS2.

## Curriculum Context

### Where this sits

Working Scientifically at KS2 is statutory but non-standalone — the Programme of Study requires it to be taught *through and integrated with* substantive science content. This cluster treats enquiry type selection as an explicit, teachable skill in its own right, then applies it across the science topics pupils are studying concurrently.

The domain progression for KS2 Working Scientifically is:

1. **CL001** — Ask scientific questions and choose the right type of enquiry ← **this cluster**
2. **CL002** — Plan investigations by identifying and controlling variables
3. **CL003** — Assessment: variable control and precision measurement
4. **CL004** — Measure systematically and record data in a variety of formats
5. **CL005** — Assessment: systematic measurement, data classification, presentation
6. **CL006** — Draw conclusions, evaluate evidence, and communicate findings
7. **CL007** — Assessment: drawing conclusions, scientific reporting, evidence evaluation
8. **CL008** — Consolidation

### Before this cluster

At KS1, pupils asked simple questions and tested ideas through observations and simple practical investigations. They will have carried out comparative tests — for example, testing which material was waterproof — but likely without the vocabulary of variables or the formal concept of a fair test.

At lower KS2 (Y3–4), pupils were introduced to standard measurements, data recording in tables and bar charts, and simple fair tests. Many will have encountered the phrase "fair test" but may not have a secure, transferable understanding of what makes a test fair or why other enquiry types are not tests at all.

### After this cluster

CL002 builds directly on this: once pupils can select the right enquiry type, they move to formal variable planning — identifying independent, dependent, and control variables. CL004 extends into measurement precision and data format selection. By the end of KS2 (CL006–CL007), pupils plan and evaluate whole enquiries independently and communicate findings in appropriate scientific formats.

At KS3, pupils are expected to use these enquiry skills autonomously in new scientific contexts. Weak enquiry selection at Y5 is a reliable predictor of difficulty with KS3 ISA-style assessments and structured practical work.

## Prerequisite Check

Before beginning this cluster, confirm pupils can:

| Prerequisite | Source | Quick check |
|---|---|---|
| Ask a question that can be investigated scientifically | SC-KS1-C001 — Asking Scientific Questions | Show three questions: 'Why is the sky blue?', 'Which paper towel soaks up most water?', 'Do plants need light to grow?' — which ones can we test? |
| Carry out a simple practical test and record a result | SC-KS1-C003 — Simple Testing | Describe in words: what did you change? What happened? |
| Compare two things in a test setting and say which was better/faster/stronger | SC-KS1-C039 — Comparative Testing Method | Brief oral discussion using a familiar context (running shoe grip, paper strength) |

**If gaps are present:** Do not spend more than 10 minutes addressing KS1 misconceptions at the start of Lesson 1. Instead, surface them via the productive failure opener (see Lesson 1) and address them explicitly when the worked example is shown. Most Y5 pupils will have a functional, if imprecise, sense of these ideas — the cluster teaches precision, not starting from zero.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this cluster, pupils will be able to:

1. **Identify** the five types of scientific enquiry (observation over time, pattern seeking, classifying and grouping, comparative and fair testing, research using secondary sources) and give an example of each.
2. **Select** the most appropriate type of enquiry to answer a given scientific question, justifying their choice.
3. **Distinguish** between a comparative test and a fair test, explaining why controlling variables makes a test more reliable.
4. **Design** a simple fair test using the planning framework: what will I change? What will I measure? What will I keep the same?
5. **Evaluate** a described investigation and explain whether it is a fair test, identifying which variable was or was not controlled.

**Bloom's alignment:** Objectives use identify (recall), select and distinguish (comprehension/analysis), design (synthesis), and evaluate — appropriate for upper KS2 pupils who are ready to move above simple recall in Working Scientifically.

## Key Vocabulary

### Tier 2 vocabulary (cross-subject academic)

*relevant, evidence, reliable, method, result, conclusion, predict, compare*

### Tier 3 vocabulary (science-specific)

*enquiry, investigate, fair test, comparative test, observation over time, pattern seeking, classify, secondary source, variable, control variable, independent variable, dependent variable*

> **Note on Y5 vocabulary loading:** Introduce *independent variable* and *dependent variable* in Lesson 3 and later — do not front-load these terms in Lessons 1–2 where the focus is on enquiry type selection. Overloading vocabulary in early lessons suppresses productive exploration.

### Vocabulary strategies

**Word wall with enquiry type cards.** Create a display with each of the five enquiry types as a named card. Each card has: the type name, a one-sentence definition (14 words maximum), and a visual icon. Pupils add example questions to each card across the cluster. The display grows as evidence of learning.

**Enquiry type sentence stems.** Provide these as a scaffold in Lessons 1–2, then withdraw in Lesson 4:
- "This is a [fair test / observation over time / pattern seeking / classifying / secondary research] because..."
- "We would keep [variable] the same because..."
- "We would change [variable] and measure [variable]."

**Explicit contrast pairs.** These confusions are predictable — address them directly:
- *relevant* vs *interesting*: a relevant question is one science can answer with evidence. An interesting question might be a philosophical question, a historical question, or simply unanswerable by practical investigation.
- *predict* vs *guess*: a prediction is based on what you already know or have observed. You should be able to say *why* you predict what you predict.
- *fair* vs *equal*: fair does not mean everyone gets a turn. Fair means only one thing is different between the groups or conditions being tested.

## Common Misconceptions

### Misconception 1: All science is done by experiments

**What pupils say:** "We always do an experiment to find out." / "The only real science is when you test something."

**Why it forms:** In primary school, the word "science" is often conflated with "practical experiment". Pattern seeking, classification, and secondary research are real scientific methods and are often how science actually progresses — pupils have rarely been taught this explicitly.

**How to address it:** Lesson 1 directly confronts this through the question sorter. Provide questions that cannot be answered by an experiment — for example, 'How are fossils formed?', 'Which planets are in our solar system?', 'How has the climate changed over 1,000 years?' — and ask pupils what they would do. When pupils say "do an experiment", follow with: "What would your experiment be? What would you change? What would you measure?" For unanswerable-by-experiment questions, this quickly reveals the limits of the misconception. Do not lecture — let the productive failure surface the gap, then close it with the worked example.

### Misconception 2: 'Fair' means everyone gets a go

**What pupils say:** "It was fair because we all tried it." / "We took turns so it was fair."

**Why it forms:** 'Fair' in everyday language means equitable treatment. In science it means variable control — a completely different meaning. Pupils have the word but the wrong semantic mapping.

**How to address it:** Introduce the car and ramp scenario (Lesson 2). Two children test cars on a ramp. One uses a long ramp, one uses a short ramp. Both get a turn. Was it fair? Push the discussion — both children are treated equally, but we still cannot compare the results. Why? The enquiry is not a fair test because more than one thing was different. Fair in science = only one thing changes.

### Misconception 3: Predictions are guesses

**What pupils say:** "I just guessed." / "I don't know, it might be anything."

**Why it forms:** If prior teaching has not connected prediction to prior knowledge, pupils treat it as a lottery and feel no responsibility for justifying their prediction.

**How to address it:** Always ask "Why do you think that?" immediately after a prediction. In Lesson 3, make the prediction-justification structure explicit: *I predict that [X] because I know/I have noticed/I have seen that [Y]*. Pupils who cannot justify a prediction are using prior knowledge implicitly — the teaching move is to surface and name what they already know.

### Misconception 4: Changing two things at once makes the test more thorough

**What pupils say:** "We changed the ramp height and the surface to get more results." / "If we test more things at once it's quicker."

**Why it forms:** Changing multiple variables does produce more data points, and pupils are often praised for ambition. The conceptual problem — that you cannot attribute the difference in results to either variable — requires understanding of causation that must be explicitly taught.

**How to address it:** Use the "muddy results" discussion in Lesson 3. Show two sets of results from the same investigation — one with one variable changed, one with two. Ask: "Which set of results tells us something? Why?" The analogy of a medical trial is useful at Y5: if you give someone a new medicine AND change their diet at the same time, and they get better, do you know which one worked? This frames variable control as a reasoning principle, not just a rule to follow.

## Lesson Sequence

This sequence follows the pedagogy profile session sequence: **challenge problem → guided exploration → worked example → independent practice → retrieval practice**. Each lesson runs 45–60 minutes for whole-class teaching. The session sequence maps onto individual AI learning sessions of 12–20 minutes, which are referenced in the adaptive learning notes (Section 10).

Productive failure is **appropriate and expected** at Y5. The challenge problems are deliberately set before explanation so that pupils generate their own (imperfect) ideas. These ideas are collected and used in the worked example phase — connecting the canonical concept to the pupil's actual thinking. Never skip the challenge problem phase in order to save time.

---

### Lesson 1 — What kind of science is this?

**Focus:** Introduce the five enquiry types. Surface the misconception that all science is experimental.

**Duration:** 55–60 minutes

**Enquiry type in play:** Classifying and grouping (meta-level — classifying questions by enquiry type)

**Phase 1 — Challenge Problem (12 minutes)**

Do not explain the five enquiry types first.

Display eight scientific questions on cards around the room (or on the board):
1. Which type of rock is most permeable?
2. How are fossils formed?
3. Do plants grow taller in sunlight or shade?
4. Which planets have moons?
5. How does the temperature of a garden change over a week?
6. How can we sort these six minerals into groups?
7. Do heavier objects fall faster?
8. What percentage of the ocean is covered by coral reefs?

Pupils work in pairs. Their task: group the questions in any way that makes sense. No categories are given. They record their groupings on mini-whiteboards or sticky notes.

Collect all groupings. Do not evaluate them. Record on the board what categories pupils created. Common emergent groupings: questions we can test / questions we have to look up; questions about living things / questions about non-living things; simple questions / hard questions. All are valid starting points.

Ask: "What was difficult about this grouping task?"

**Phase 2 — Guided Exploration (15 minutes)**

"Scientists have been thinking about this exact problem — how to group the different ways we do science — for a long time."

Introduce the five enquiry types using five named, illustrated cards. For each type, give a one-sentence definition and one example from the list they just grouped:

| Type | Short definition | Example from the list |
|---|---|---|
| Observation over time | Watch and record how something changes | Q5 — garden temperature over a week |
| Pattern seeking | Collect lots of data and look for a pattern | Q7 — do heavier objects fall faster? |
| Classifying and grouping | Sort things using features | Q6 — sorting minerals |
| Fair and comparative testing | Change one thing, keep others the same, measure the difference | Q1, Q3 |
| Research using secondary sources | Find out using books, databases, experts | Q2, Q4, Q8 |

Now revisit the pupils' own groupings from Phase 1. For each group's categories, ask: "Which of these five types best matches what you called [their label]?" Connect their language to the canonical vocabulary. "You called these 'questions we can test' — scientists call those fair tests or comparative tests. You were right."

**Phase 3 — Worked Example (10 minutes)**

Use the `drag_categorise` interaction (4–5 categories for Y5). Present eight new questions. Pupils drag each question to its enquiry type. Work through two together as a class (the worked example), then pupils complete the remaining six independently.

Post-activity: display all correct placements simultaneously before discussing.

Feedback phrase model: "You placed 'How does a caterpillar change?' under observation over time — you recognised that change over time means watching, not testing. That is the classification principle you need."

**Phase 4 — Independent Practice (10 minutes)**

Pupils write two questions of their own: one that would need a fair test, one that would need secondary research. Pairs share and discuss. Class votes on whether each question was correctly categorised.

**Phase 5 — Retrieval Practice (8 minutes)**

Three `multi_choice_4` questions — one per enquiry type, drawn from a different topic to the main lesson (interleaving). For example: "A scientist wants to know whether birds sing more in summer or winter. What type of enquiry is this?" Distractors map to documented misconceptions.

**Differentiation:**
- Support: Provide a sentence starter for Phase 4. Reduce the sorting task to six questions with three categories (observation over time, fair test, secondary research).
- Extension: Pupils evaluate whether two of the eight questions could validly be answered by more than one enquiry type and explain why.

---

### Lesson 2 — Comparative tests: exploring before controlling

**Focus:** Introduce comparative testing through an uncontrolled, messy investigation. Surface the need for variable control through experience.

**Duration:** 55–60 minutes

**Enquiry type in play:** Comparative testing (moving towards fair testing)

**Phase 1 — Challenge Problem: The Muddy Ramp (15 minutes)**

Give groups a toy car and a ramp (made from a plank and books). Their challenge: find out which surface the car travels furthest on. They have: carpet offcut, sandpaper, smooth card, bubble wrap.

Crucially — give no instructions about how to set up the test. Let groups devise their own method.

Most groups will produce results that cannot be compared: different ramp heights, different starting positions, different push strengths, different measurement methods. Collect all group results on the board as a class data table.

Ask: "Can we say which surface is best from this data?" Let pupils argue. Expect genuine disagreement. This is productive failure — the experience of not being able to compare results because the test was not controlled.

Do not resolve this yet.

**Phase 2 — Guided Exploration (15 minutes)**

"Before we fix our test, let's think about what was different between the groups."

List what each group did differently. Pupils identify these as *variables* — things that can change. Introduce the word variable explicitly with a definition: "A variable is anything in an investigation that could change or be different."

Ask: "If we want to compare the surfaces fairly, which variable should we change on purpose? Which variables should stay the same?"

Use the planning framework for the first time:
- What will we **change**? (The surface.)
- What will we **measure**? (Distance the car travels.)
- What will we **keep the same**? (Ramp height, starting position, no push — release from the same point, same car.)

Discuss: this is now a fair test. The old messy version was a comparative test — we compared things, but we cannot be sure what caused the difference.

**Phase 3 — Worked Example (10 minutes)**

Re-run one condition of the ramp investigation using the agreed fair test setup. Pupils observe. Discuss: "What is the same this time that was different before?"

Show a second scenario side-by-side: "Alex tested three paper towels for absorbency. She poured the same amount of water on each, left them for the same time, and measured the wet patch. Was this a fair test?" Pupils evaluate using the three-question framework.

**Phase 4 — Independent Practice (10 minutes)**

Pupils redesign the ramp investigation on paper using the planning framework. They write: what they change, what they measure, what they keep the same, and give one reason why keeping those variables the same matters.

`matching_pairs` task (6–8 pairs at Y5): match variable to its role in the ramp investigation (e.g., "ramp height" — "control variable"; "surface type" — "independent variable" (introduce this term here); "distance travelled" — "dependent variable"). Near-miss distractors included.

**Phase 5 — Retrieval Practice (8 minutes)**

Three questions mixing this lesson with Lesson 1. For example: "Freya wants to know which fertiliser makes tomato plants grow tallest. She plants five tomatoes, each in a different fertiliser, but uses pots of different sizes. What is wrong with her investigation?" This interleaves variable control (this lesson) with enquiry type selection (Lesson 1).

**Differentiation:**
- Support: Pre-labelled planning framework sheet. Pupils fill in blanks rather than generating the framework from scratch.
- Extension: Design an investigation to test whether type of soil affects how quickly seeds germinate. Write the planning framework and predict two things that would make the test unfair.

---

### Lesson 3 — The productive struggle: planning from a question

**Focus:** Pupils independently select enquiry type and produce a planning framework for an unfamiliar question. This is the productive struggle lesson — expect difficulty.

**Duration:** 60 minutes

**Enquiry type in play:** Pupils choose the type — this is the point.

**Phase 1 — Challenge Problem (15 minutes)**

Three question cards, one per group (differentiated by complexity):
- A: "Does the colour of a flower affect the number of insects that visit it?"
- B: "How does the temperature of water affect how quickly sugar dissolves?"
- C: "Do astronauts experience the same health effects in space as they would on a long sea voyage?"

Task: For your question, (a) identify which type of enquiry is most appropriate and why; (b) if it is a fair test or comparative test, complete the planning framework; (c) write down one thing that could go wrong with your plan.

Groups work without teacher input for 12–15 minutes. Teacher circulates, says nothing evaluative, collects evidence of thinking. Take photos or quick notes on what groups have produced.

The difficulty here is intentional. Groups doing Question B may argue about whether this is pattern seeking or a fair test (it is a fair test with a continuous independent variable — temperature). Groups doing Question C may find the enquiry type genuinely hard to identify (it is pattern seeking / secondary research — ethical issues prevent live investigation). Let groups struggle.

**Phase 2 — Guided Exploration (15 minutes)**

Groups share their choices and reasoning. Display all plans side by side. Use structured discussion:
- "Group 2 chose [type]. Group 4 chose a different type for the same question. Both groups, can you argue your case?"
- "What additional information would you need to decide?"

This is not a quiz — there are sometimes genuinely competing valid options. Science acknowledges this.

Model scientific thinking explicitly: "When I see a question like 'does X affect Y?', I ask myself: can I actually change X in a lab or classroom setting? If yes, is there only one thing I would be changing? If both yes, this is a fair test. If I cannot control the variable, it might be pattern seeking or observation over time."

**Phase 3 — Worked Example (12 minutes)**

Present a teacher-modelled question: "Does the surface of a shoe sole affect how far a person slides on a wet floor?"

Think aloud through the entire planning framework:
- "My first question is: what type of enquiry is this? I want to compare different sole surfaces — so it feels like a fair test. Let me check the three-question framework. What will I change? Sole surface type. What will I measure? Distance of slide. What will I keep the same? The floor, the weight on the shoe, the amount of water, the angle... right, I can list several things. Yes — this is a fair test."
- "Now my prediction: I predict that a flat sole will slide further than a ridged sole because ridged surfaces have more grip. I know this from using shoe grip on ice."
- "One thing that could go wrong: if I used different people for each shoe, heavier people might slide differently. I should use the same weighted dummy or the same person."

Pupils annotate a printed copy of this plan as you model it, adding their own ideas.

**Phase 4 — Independent Practice (12 minutes)**

Pupils return to their challenge problem from Phase 1 and revise their plan in light of the worked example. They write a brief evaluation: "Before I saw the worked example, I thought... Now I think... because..."

`pattern_discovery` (I Notice / I Wonder) task: display a data table from a previous fair test (e.g., ramp investigation results from Lesson 2, completed by a previous class). Pupils use the I Notice / I Wonder structure to generate observations before drawing conclusions. Teacher does not evaluate observations during this phase — "That is interesting, what else do you notice?" This prepares for CL002 (variable control in planning) and CL006 (drawing conclusions).

**Phase 5 — Retrieval Practice (8 minutes)**

Spaced retrieval: include one question from Lesson 1 (enquiry type identification) alongside two questions from this lesson. For example: "Tom noticed that plants near the window were taller than plants on a shelf. What type of enquiry could Tom do to find out if light causes plants to grow taller? Why would this be better than just observing the plants near the window?" This forces distinction between pattern seeking (noticing correlation) and fair testing (establishing causation).

**Metacognitive moment (Y5 — appropriate):** At the close of the lesson, ask: "What was the hardest decision you made today? Why was it hard?" Pupils write or say one sentence. Teacher collects. The purpose is not to assess — it is to begin the habit of reflecting on the difficulty of scientific thinking itself. At Y5, this is appropriate to introduce explicitly. Do not ask this every lesson — use it at the productive struggle lesson and at the end of the cluster.

**Differentiation:**
- Support: Pupils use Question A (flower/insect) which has a clear pattern-seeking answer. Planning framework is partially completed.
- Extension: Pupils use Question C (astronauts) and must argue why a fair test is not possible here and what alternative they would use.

---

### Lesson 4 — Putting it together: a full enquiry planning cycle

**Focus:** Apply both concepts (enquiry selection and fair test planning) in a continuous task using a new topic.

**Duration:** 55–60 minutes

**Enquiry type in play:** Pupils select — then execute a fair test in the second half.

**Context:** Embed this lesson in the substantive science topic being taught concurrently (e.g., Forces, Properties of Materials, Dissolving — whichever the class is currently studying). This is the statutory expectation: Working Scientifically must be taught through content.

**Example context used here:** Properties of materials (dissolving and filtration).

**Phase 1 — Challenge Problem (12 minutes)**

Present a class investigation brief: "We want to know more about which materials dissolve in water and whether it matters how hot the water is."

Task: Without any help, write a plan for how you would find out. Use the three-question framework if it helps. Decide what type of enquiry you would do.

Collect plans. Most pupils will attempt a fair test. Some will conflate the two sub-questions (whether materials dissolve; whether temperature affects rate) into one messy investigation — this is the predicted difficulty for this lesson.

**Phase 2 — Guided Exploration (12 minutes)**

Class discussion: "Some plans had two questions mixed together. Can we separate them?"

Pupils recognise that "Which materials dissolve?" is a classifying question (sort materials into dissolves / does not dissolve). "Does temperature affect how quickly sugar dissolves?" is a fair test.

This is an important insight at Y5: a single practical session can involve more than one enquiry type depending on what question is being asked. Model this explicitly.

**Phase 3 — Practical Fair Test (20 minutes)**

Groups carry out the fair test component: "Does the temperature of water affect how quickly sugar dissolves?"

Each group uses the written planning framework (completed at start of phase):
- Change: temperature of water (cold, room temperature, warm, hot — or three levels if time limited)
- Measure: time taken for a set amount of sugar to dissolve fully
- Keep the same: amount of water, amount of sugar, whether we stir, which sugar we use

This is a live practical — the planning phase has already happened. Teacher role in the practical is to enforce the planning framework: "You said you would keep the amount of water the same. Let me see your measuring cylinder."

Pupils record results in a table (format their own choice at this stage — CL004 addresses systematic recording).

**Phase 4 — Independent Practice and Worked Example combined (10 minutes)**

Display a badly designed version of the same investigation (pre-prepared by teacher): different amounts of sugar for each temperature, stirred sometimes, not stirred at other times. Pupils evaluate using the three-question framework: "Was this a fair test? What went wrong? How would you fix it?"

`multi_choice_4` question as a written check: "Which of these changes would make the sugar investigation unfair? A — Using the same cup for every test. B — Using a different amount of sugar for each temperature. C — Measuring with the same timer. D — Starting each test with fresh water." Each distractor maps to a documented misconception.

**Phase 5 — Retrieval Practice (8 minutes)**

Interleaved retrieval drawing from all four lessons. One question on enquiry type identification (Lesson 1), one on variable naming (Lesson 2), one on predicting with justification (Lesson 3), one on evaluating a fair test (this lesson). Pupils answer individually in written or diagrammatic form.

**Differentiation:**
- Support: Planning framework fully scaffolded. Practical — pupils carry out one comparison only (cold vs hot) with support observing and timing.
- Extension: Design a second, linked investigation: "Does it matter which sugar you use?" — pupils decide enquiry type, plan, and explain how their two investigations together would give more complete knowledge about dissolving.

---

### Lesson 5 — Consolidation and Transfer

**Focus:** Apply cluster learning to a novel context. Introduce the question of reliability (repeat measures) as a bridge to CL002.

**Duration:** 55–60 minutes

**Enquiry type in play:** Pupil-selected across a range of question cards.

**Phase 1 — Challenge Problem: The Science News Desk (15 minutes)**

Give groups a "science news" scenario card — a brief (3–4 sentence) fictional account of an investigation, written in a journalistic style:

> "Scientists at a university tested whether listening to music makes people better at maths. They gave 200 students a maths test. 100 listened to music. 100 had silence. The music group scored higher on average."

Task: Write three questions you would want to ask before you believed this result. Is this a fair test? What type of enquiry is this? What would have made it more reliable?

Most pupils will produce good questions — but may not immediately see that "100 listened to music" and "100 had silence" is a comparative test, not technically a fair test (because the researchers cannot control which students choose music). This is a harder question that bridges to CL002 and is appropriate for Y5.

**Phase 2 — Guided Exploration (12 minutes)**

Pupils share their questions. Teacher compiles on the board. Introduce the concept of *repeat measures* — we do a test more than once to check that our result is reliable, not just a one-off. "What if the music group got lucky and happened to be better at maths anyway?"

Bridge language: "Once you have identified the right type of enquiry and planned your fair test, the next question a scientist always asks is: how many times do I need to test this before I can trust the result? That is what we will explore in the next cluster."

**Phase 3 — Enquiry Type Transfer Task (20 minutes)**

Individual transfer task — this is the independent assessment preparation for CL003. Each pupil receives a card with three questions from three different topic areas (not ones they have used in previous lessons). They must:
1. Identify the enquiry type for each question
2. For any fair test, complete the planning framework
3. For any non-experimental enquiry, explain what method they would use and why an experiment would not work

`drag_categorise` (up to 5 categories, Y5) as a digital version of the same task for pupils using the AI system.

**Phase 4 — Worked Example (10 minutes)**

Teacher models a transfer task question from a topic the class has not explicitly covered (e.g., a geography or history scenario — to demonstrate that Working Scientifically thinking applies beyond science). "Can the same thinking apply outside science lessons?" Brief discussion. Most Y5 pupils find this surprising and generative.

**Phase 5 — Retrieval Practice and Metacognitive Close (8 minutes)**

Three retrieval questions drawing from the whole cluster (interleaved). Then:

Metacognitive close: "Look at the five enquiry types on the wall. Which one do you find easiest to identify? Which is hardest? Why do you think that is?" Write one sentence. Share with a partner. Two or three volunteers share with the class.

Teacher collects responses. Use these to plan focused CL002 teaching — particularly noting which pupils struggle with the fair test / pattern seeking distinction, as this will directly affect their ability to plan variable-controlled investigations.

**Differentiation:**
- Support: Transfer task limited to two question types (fair test and secondary research). Sentence frames available.
- Extension: Write a "common mistakes" guide for a Y3 pupil who is just learning about fair tests. The guide must explain three things that people get wrong and why they are wrong.

---

### Lesson 6 — Review, Gaps, and Bridge to CL002

**Duration:** 45–50 minutes

**Focus:** Address outstanding gaps identified in Lessons 3–5 assessments. Establish readiness for CL002 (variable control and planning).

This lesson is deliberately flexible — its content depends on the formative evidence gathered across the cluster. The three most common residual gaps at this stage are:

1. Pattern seeking vs fair test confusion (particularly for questions with continuous variables like temperature, time, or mass).
2. Prediction without justification — pupils have the structure but write "I predict that X will happen" without stating reasoning.
3. Variable listing — pupils name the independent variable correctly but cannot list more than one control variable.

Structure the lesson around the class's actual gaps, not the predicted ones. Use the retrieval practice data from Lessons 1–5 to identify who needs which support.

**Bridge activity:** The "And then what?" chain. Present a planning framework for a fair test. Pupils complete it. Then ask: "Once you have your results — then what? What would you do next to be confident?" This introduces reliability (repeat measures) and the idea of anomalous results, which leads into CL002 planning. Do not teach these concepts now — plant the question. CL002 opens with this exact bridge.

---

## Assessment and Feedback

### Assessing scientific thinking (not just content)

Working Scientifically is a skills domain. Assessment must probe thinking processes, not just recall of enquiry type names. Avoid assessments that can be passed by memorising a list.

**High-value assessment tasks:**
- Given an unfamiliar scenario, identify the enquiry type and justify the choice (Lesson 5 transfer task)
- Evaluate a described investigation for fairness and suggest improvements (Lesson 4 baddesign task)
- Given results from a messy comparative test, explain why you cannot draw a conclusion from them (Lesson 2)

**Indicators of secure understanding:**
- Pupils use *variable* language spontaneously, not only when prompted
- Pupils can say why a question cannot be answered by a fair test — not just that it should use secondary research
- Pupils can identify what a scientist would *change* and what they would *keep the same* for a new, unfamiliar question
- Predictions include justification: "because I already know/have noticed..."

**Indicators of developing understanding:**
- Pupils can name the five enquiry types but cannot select reliably for unfamiliar questions
- Pupils complete the planning framework when scaffolded but cannot initiate it independently
- Predictions are given without reasoning

**Indicators that re-teaching is needed:**
- Pupils still classify all investigations as "experiments"
- Pupils cannot name more than one control variable for a simple fair test
- Pupils say a test was "fair" because everyone got a turn

### Feedback language (from the FeedbackProfile)

The feedback profile for this year group specifies **specific competence feedback** with a **warm, competence-focused tone**. The purpose is to name the exact skill or reasoning the pupil demonstrated.

**Feedback on correct responses — examples:**

- "You noticed that the question uses the word 'affect' — that is a signal that someone wants to know if one thing changes another. You were right to choose a fair test."
- "You listed three control variables. That tells me you understand that lots of things could change the result, not just the one thing you are testing."
- "Your prediction says *because* — that means you used something you already know to make a scientific guess, not a random one. That is exactly what scientists do."

**Feedback on errors — examples:**

- "That one caught you — pattern seeking and fair testing both involve looking at whether one thing affects another, so it is an easy mix-up. The difference is whether you can actually *control* the variable. In your question, the scientist cannot control the weather — so it must be pattern seeking, not a fair test."
- "You said the test was fair because both groups got the same amount of time. Good thinking — but there was one other thing that was different. Can you find it?" (Hint tier 1 — not a correction, a re-direction.)
- "You listed the independent variable correctly. The dependent variable is the one that responds — the thing you measure. In this investigation, that would be the [blank]." (Hint tier 2 — partial reveal.)

**Normalising productive struggle:**

- "That one took longer — your brain was connecting the enquiry type to the question, and that is a harder job than just remembering a definition."
- "You went back and changed your answer. That is not a mistake — it is exactly what scientists do when they look at their evidence again."

**Phrases to avoid (from the FeedbackProfile):**

Do not say: "Wrong", "Incorrect", "You need to improve", "Well done!", "Amazing!", "That is not right", "Try again" (without guidance), "Nearly" (without specifying what is missing).

### Metacognitive prompts

At Y5, metacognitive reflection is appropriate to introduce explicitly. Use these prompts at the close of Lessons 3 and 5 (not every lesson — overuse reduces impact):

- "What was the hardest decision you made in science today? Why was it hard?"
- "Which type of enquiry do you find easiest to recognise? Which is hardest? Do you know why?"
- "Before today's lesson, I thought... Now I think... because..."
- "If you were explaining fair tests to a younger pupil, what is the one thing you would most want them to understand?"

Do not grade or evaluate metacognitive responses. The purpose is to build the habit of thinking about thinking — this is the foundation for the deeper reflection required at KS3.

## Adaptive Learning Notes (for the AI System)

This section describes how the AI tutoring system should behave when delivering this cluster in 12–20 minute sessions.

### Session structure per AI session

Each session follows: **challenge problem → guided exploration → worked example → independent practice → retrieval practice**. The challenge problem is always first — do not explain before asking the pupil to attempt. Sessions are capped at 20 minutes.

### If a pupil cannot identify the right type of enquiry

**Tier 1 hint (after first incorrect attempt):** Ask a diagnostic question without revealing the answer. "Does the scientist in this question have control over [variable]? Can they change it on purpose?" Wait for response. If pupil answers correctly, re-present the original question.

**Tier 2 hint (after second incorrect attempt):** Narrow the choice. "This is either a fair test or pattern seeking. Here is the difference: in a fair test, the scientist controls the variable. In pattern seeking, the scientist collects data from things that already exist. Which sounds more like this question?" Present as `multi_choice_3` with the two candidate types plus one clearly wrong option.

**Tier 3 hint (after third incorrect attempt):** Partial reveal plus worked reasoning. "This is a pattern seeking investigation. Here is why: the scientist is measuring temperatures in different cities — they cannot control which city has which temperature. They are looking for a pattern in data that already exists. Does that make sense?" Follow immediately with a parallel example where the pupil applies the same reasoning to a new question.

**If all three tiers are exhausted:** Flag this pupil-concept pairing for teacher review. Do not loop on the same question. Move to a consolidation question on an easier concept and note the gap in the session record.

### Hint tier strategy

Maximum 3 hint tiers per question (per pedagogy profile). The sequence is:
1. Diagnostic re-direction (no content revealed)
2. Choice narrowing (misconception-targeted)
3. Partial worked reasoning (concept explained, parallel practice required)

Never provide the answer without requiring the pupil to demonstrate application on a new example. A correct answer after a full hint cascade does not constitute mastery — flag for retrieval in the next session.

### Spaced retrieval

Spacing interval: 2–7 days between sessions (per pedagogy profile).

- Questions from Lesson 1 (enquiry type identification) should recur in AI sessions during Lessons 3, 5, and again at the start of CL002.
- Questions from Lesson 2 (variable identification) should recur during Lessons 4, 6, and the CL003 assessment preparation.
- The system should interleave questions from earlier in the cluster with new material in every session (desirable difficulty: interleaving is active for this profile).

### Desirable difficulties in use

**Spacing:** Sessions are scheduled with a 2–7 day gap. Do not present this cluster's material in consecutive daily slots without a break. The gap between Lesson 2 and Lesson 3 is pedagogically intentional.

**Interleaving:** Every AI retrieval session mixes questions from at least two different lessons in this cluster. From Lesson 3 onwards, retrieval sessions also draw one question from outside Working Scientifically (e.g., a content topic the pupil has been studying concurrently — dissolving, forces, the water cycle) to embed Working Scientifically thinking in a content context.

### Fair test / pattern seeking confusion (most common AI flag)

If the system detects persistent confusion between fair testing and pattern seeking (more than two errors across different sessions), trigger a specific `pattern_discovery` activity:

Present a split-screen showing two investigations side by side — one fair test, one pattern-seeking study. Pupils use "I Notice / I Wonder" to generate observations about both. After the discovery phase, the AI connects their observations to the classification principle: "You noticed that in Investigation A, the scientist *decided* how warm the water would be. In Investigation B, the scientist measured temperatures in places they could not control. That difference — control vs. collection — is what separates a fair test from pattern seeking."

## Resources

### Equipment (practical lessons)

**Lesson 2 — Ramp investigation:**
- Toy cars (identical model, or clearly labelled by group)
- Wooden plank or adjustable ramp
- Books or blocks for consistent ramp height (pre-set to same height for all groups)
- Surface samples: smooth card, carpet offcut, sandpaper, bubble wrap (cut to consistent size)
- Metre sticks or measuring tape
- Masking tape for start and finish lines

**Lesson 4 — Dissolving investigation:**
- Heat-safe beakers or cups (four per group)
- Granulated white sugar (pre-weighed into equal portions — 5g per test)
- Water at four temperatures: cold (from fridge), room temperature, warm (40°C), hot (60°C) — use thermometers to verify
- Identical teaspoons if stirring is agreed as a method; or agree no stirring
- Stopwatches
- Thermometers (one per group)
- Results table template (printed)

### Data sets

**Lesson 3 — Ramp results from a previous class:** Pre-prepare a fictional results table showing messy, uncontrolled data (different ramp heights, some results missing). Use this as the "muddy results" worked example.

**Lesson 5 — Science news scenario cards:** Print one card per group. Scenarios should be brief (3–4 sentences), use accessible language (max 14 words per sentence), and describe investigations from science, health, or environmental topics. Prepare five different scenarios so groups work with different contexts.

### Digital / AI interaction types in use

| Lesson | Interaction type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `drag_categorise` (4–5 categories) | Sort questions by enquiry type |
| 1 | `multi_choice_4` | Retrieval — enquiry type identification |
| 2 | `matching_pairs` (6–8 pairs) | Match variables to their roles |
| 3 | `pattern_discovery` | I Notice / I Wonder on results data |
| 3 | `multi_choice_4` | Retrieval — variable identification |
| 4 | `multi_choice_4` | Evaluate a fair test for errors |
| 5 | `drag_categorise` | Transfer task — enquiry type selection |

### Teacher reference documents

- Five enquiry types card set (A5, laminated) — one set per pair
- Planning framework sheet: What will I change? / What will I measure? / What will I keep the same? (A4, reusable)
- Vocabulary display cards (word wall) — one per enquiry type, plus: variable, reliable, predict, evidence, conclusion
- Feedback phrase reference sheet (for teacher use) — includes examples of specific competence feedback and phrases to avoid

## Links to Next Learning

### Immediate next cluster: CL002 — Plan investigations by identifying and controlling variables

This cluster introduces the vocabulary and conceptual framework. CL002 requires pupils to use that framework in detail: naming independent, dependent, and control variables formally; considering what a *fair range* of values looks like; and recognising the role of repeat measures in reliability. Pupils who leave CL001 able to complete the planning framework independently are well prepared. Pupils who still need scaffolding to list control variables will need additional support at the start of CL002.

### Within upper KS2

- **Forces (Y5):** Every investigation in Forces — water resistance, air resistance, levers — is a fair test. The planning framework from this cluster applies directly.
- **Properties of materials (Y5):** Dissolving, filtration, and reversible/irreversible changes all involve comparative and fair testing. The dissolving investigation in Lesson 4 embeds this deliberately.
- **Living things and habitats (Y5/6):** Pattern seeking and observation over time are the dominant enquiry types. Classification is central to the living things curriculum.
- **Light and electricity (Y5/6):** Circuit investigations are fair tests; shadow formation investigations are observation tasks that can transition to fair tests.

### At KS3

The transition from KS2 to KS3 science consistently exposes gaps in Working Scientifically. Pupils who cannot spontaneously identify independent and dependent variables, or who default to "we did an experiment" rather than specifying the enquiry type, struggle with:
- Structured written planning in Y7 investigations
- ISA-style practical assessments
- Understanding why scientists replicate experiments (reliability and validity)
- The concept of a controlled experiment in biology and chemistry

The vocabulary and frameworks established in this cluster — enquiry type, fair test, variable control — are the direct prerequisites for GCSE scientific methodology at KS4. Teaching this well at Y5 is not abstract preparation: it is building the scientific metalanguage pupils will use for the next seven years.
