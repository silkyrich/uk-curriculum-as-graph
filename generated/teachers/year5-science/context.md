# Lesson Context: Ask scientific questions and choose the right type of enquiry

> **Cluster**: `SC-KS2-D001-CL001` | Type: introduction |  ✓ Curated

## Overview

- **Subject**: Science
- **Year group**: Y3 (None)
- **Domain**: Working Scientifically (`SC-KS2-D001`)
- **Estimated teaching time**: 6 lessons (~2.0 weeks)
- **Modelled on**: NGSS SEP 1 - Asking Questions; SEP 3 - Planning Investigations

### Pedagogical rationale

Selecting appropriate enquiry type (including fair and comparative testing) is the gateway skill for all KS2 scientific investigation. Co_teach_hints link C001 and C002 directly.

## Curriculum context

Working scientifically at KS2 underpins all science learning and requires pupils to use a range of scientific methods and processes, progressing from the exploratory approaches of KS1 to systematic, fair-test investigations. Pupils develop the ability to plan different types of scientific enquiry — including observing over time, pattern seeking, classifying, comparative and fair testing, and researching using secondary sources — selecting the most appropriate method for the question being asked. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to recognise that scientific evidence is used to support or refute ideas, to take measurements using standard units, to record and present data in a variety of graphical forms, and to draw conclusions consistent with their evidence. By the end of KS2, pupils should be able to report and present findings from enquiries using appropriate scientific language and representations.

## Concepts in this cluster (2)

### Relevant Questioning and Enquiry Selection
*`SC-KS2-C001` · process · complexity 3 · weight 3*

The ability to ask relevant scientific questions and select the most appropriate type of scientific enquiry to answer them (observation over time, pattern seeking, classifying, fair testing, secondary research). Develops from KS1 simple questioning to active enquiry design.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce the five types of scientific enquiry explicitly: observation over time, pattern seeking, classifying and grouping, comparative and fair testing, and researching using secondary sources. Present pupils with a question and ask them to decide which type of enquiry would best answer it. Use a 'question sorter' display where pupils categorise questions by enquiry type. Model asking relevant questions by connecting to the content being studied — for example, during a rocks topic ask 'Which rock is the most permeable?' (fair test) versus 'How are fossils formed?' (secondary research).

**Key vocabulary:** enquiry, investigate, fair test, comparative test, observation over time, pattern seeking, classify, secondary source, relevant, variable, method, question

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often believe that all scientific questions must be answered by carrying out an experiment. They need explicit teaching that observation over time, classification, pattern seeking and secondary research are equally valid enquiry types. Some pupils confuse 'relevant' questions with 'interesting' questions — relevant questions are those that can be investigated scientifically.

### Fair and Comparative Testing
*`SC-KS2-C002` · process · complexity 3 · weight 3*

Setting up simple practical enquiries as fair tests, recognising and controlling variables. Understanding that a fair test changes only one variable at a time while keeping others constant, enabling valid comparisons.

**Teaching guidance:** Begin with comparative tests (e.g., 'Which surface does the car travel furthest on?') before introducing fair tests with controlled variables. Use a planning framework that explicitly asks: 'What will I change? What will I measure? What will I keep the same?' Provide practical contexts such as testing which paper towel is most absorbent or which material is best for insulating a cup of warm water. Encourage pupils to predict outcomes before testing and to explain why the test must be fair to get reliable results.

**Key vocabulary:** fair test, comparative test, variable, change, measure, keep the same, control, predict, result, reliable, method, equipment

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils frequently change more than one variable at a time without recognising this invalidates the comparison. Some pupils believe that a test is 'fair' simply because everyone in the group gets a turn, rather than understanding it as controlling variables. Pupils may also confuse prediction with guessing — a prediction should be based on existing knowledge or prior observations.

## Learner profile

### Content & language guidelines

- **Reading level**: Most children are independent readers of simple texts. Reading fluency varies widely. Decoding is largely automatic for common words.
- **Lexile range**: 150–350L
- **FK grade max**: 2
- **Max sentence length**: 14 words
- **TTS required**: No
- **Academic vocabulary**: Avoid

> **AI content instruction**: Use clear, active sentences with one idea per sentence. Subject vocabulary can be used if first introduced with a definition. Avoid passive voice. Metaphors and similes are helpful for abstract science concepts. Questions can require 1–3 word written answers or spoken responses.

### Pedagogy profile

- **Session length**: 12–20 minutes
- **Scaffolding**: moderate_to_high
- **Productive failure**: Appropriate ✓
- **Hint tiers**: max 3
- **Spacing interval**: 2–7 days
- **Session sequence**: challenge_problem → guided_exploration → worked_example → independent_practice → retrieval_practice
- **Active desirable difficulties**: spacing, interleaving

> **AI pedagogy instruction**: Start with a challenge problem — do not explain first. Let the child attempt independently for 2–3 minutes. Collect their attempt. Then show the worked example. Follow with 3–4 retrieval practice questions that mix this concept with previously mastered material (interleaving). Contextualize difficulty: 'That one was harder — your brain was working to connect different ideas.'

### Feedback profile

- **Style**: specific_competence
- **AI tone**: warm_competence_focused
- **Gamification**: ⚠ Not safe — avoid
- **Unexpected delight**: Safe ✓ (semi_random)
- **Explicit misconception correction**: Keep implicit
- **Metacognitive reflection**: Not yet
- **Example (correct)**: "You spotted the pattern — all the multiples of 6 end in an even number. That is a really useful thing to notice."
- **Example (incorrect)**: "That one got you — 7×8 trips up a lot of people. Here is a trick: 7×7 is 49, so 7×8 is just 7 more, which gives 56."
- **Avoid phrases**: "Wrong", "Incorrect", "You need to improve", "Well done!", "Amazing!"

> **AI feedback instruction**: Specific competence feedback: name the pattern, rule, or skill the child demonstrated. On error, explain the specific misconception (not just 'wrong') and give the reasoning to fix it. Normalize productive struggle: 'That one took longer — your brain was making new connections.' Never compare to other children or previous performance.

### Interaction types available

**Primary (preferred):**
- **Pattern Discovery — I Notice / I Wonder** (`pattern_discovery`, higher_order)
  > This is the productive failure activation phase — do NOT correct or evaluate observations during discovery. Say 'That is interesting, what else do you notice?' to all responses. After the discovery phase, connect the child's actual observations to the canonical concept: 'You noticed [X] — that is the [Y] pattern.'
- **Drag to Categorise** (`drag_categorise`, manipulation)
  > Limit to 2–3 categories for Y3, up to 4–5 for Y5+. Confirm whether items are mutually exclusive or can belong to multiple categories. In feedback, explain the classification principle, not just the correct placement.
- **Matching Pairs** (`matching_pairs`, manipulation)
  > Limit to 4–5 pairs for Y3–Y4, up to 6–8 pairs for Y5+. Distractors should be near-misses (similar terms, not obviously unrelated). After matching, display all correct pairs simultaneously before moving on.
- **Multiple Choice — 3 Options** (`multi_choice_3`, selection)
  > Provide 1 correct answer and 2 plausible distractors. Distractors should represent common misconceptions, not random wrong answers. Label A/B/C only if children are Y3+.
- **Multiple Choice — 4 Options** (`multi_choice_4`, selection)
  > 1 correct answer + 3 distractors. Each distractor should address a specific, documented misconception from the curriculum domain. Explain why the distractor is wrong in post-answer feedback.
- **Text Input — Single Word** (`text_input_word`, text_input)
  > Accept near-miss spellings (within 2 Levenshtein edits of the correct answer). Do not penalise spelling errors unless spelling is the assessed skill. Provide word-length hint (e.g. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ) if child makes 2 failed attempts.

**Secondary (available):**
- Voice Input (`voice_input`, input)
- Voice Recorder — Record and Playback (`voice_recorder`, input)
- Drag and Drop — Place on Target (`drag_drop_place`, manipulation)
- Image Annotation — Tap to Label (`image_annotation`, manipulation)
- Area Model (Grid / Array for Multiplication) (`area_model_multiplication`, maths_tool)
- Column Subtraction (Formal Written Method with Exchanging) (`column_subtraction`, maths_tool)
- Fraction Visualiser (Bar / Pizza / Set Model) (`fraction_visualizer`, maths_tool)
