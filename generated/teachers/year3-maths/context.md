# Lesson Context: Understand and apply place value in three-digit numbers

> **Cluster**: `MA-Y3-D001-CL002` | Type: practice | ⭐ Keystone cluster ✓ Curated

## Overview

- **Subject**: Mathematics
- **Year group**: Y3 (None)
- **Domain**: Number - Number and Place Value (`MA-Y3-D001`)
- **Estimated teaching time**: 9 lessons (~3.0 weeks)
- **Modelled on**: CC Math 2.NBT.A - Understand place value to hundreds

### Pedagogical rationale

Place value understanding (C007), partitioning (C008), and finding 10/100 more or less (C005, C006) are tightly bound by co_teach_hints. Together they build the core conceptual architecture for three-digit numbers.

## Curriculum context

In lower key stage 2, the principal focus of mathematics teaching is to ensure that pupils become increasingly fluent with whole numbers and the four operations, including number facts and the concept of place value. In Year 3, pupils extend their understanding of the number system from two-digit numbers (explored in KS1) to three-digit numbers, developing secure knowledge of the hundreds, tens and ones structure. The non-statutory guidance emphasises that pupils should use a variety of representations including the number line to practise counting in fours, eights, fifties and hundreds, and should connect their new knowledge of the number system to measurement — for example, linking counting in 50s to amounts on a scale. Pupils who understand place value in three-digit numbers are equipped to undertake the mental and written arithmetic that is central to the rest of Year 3 mathematics, and this domain forms the essential prerequisite for the four-digit work of Year 4.

### Finding 10 more and 10 less
*`MA-Y3-C005` · skill · complexity 2 · weight 2*

Finding 10 more or 10 less than any given three-digit number requires understanding that only the tens digit changes (e.g. 246 + 10 = 256). This extends the KS1 skill of finding 10 more/less with two-digit numbers to the three-digit range. Mastery means a pupil can instantly identify 10 more/less than any three-digit number, including those where the tens digit reaches 0 or 9 (requiring the hundreds digit to change).

**Teaching guidance:** Use a 0-1000 number line with clear decade markings. Dienes blocks are powerful: adding a ten-stick shows the change physically. A hundred square extended to show three-digit numbers helps pupils see the pattern. Focus on the boundary cases: 10 more than 190 is 200 (the tens digit overflows into the hundreds); 10 less than 200 is 190 (borrowing from the hundreds). Practise with rapid-fire questions.

**Key vocabulary:** ten more, ten less, tens digit, hundreds digit, increase, decrease, partition

**Common misconceptions:** When the tens digit is 9, pupils often say 10 more than 196 is 1096 (adding a 1 in front) or 196 + 10 = 1,106. When the tens digit is 0, pupils may say 10 less than 300 is 390 rather than 290. These boundary errors reveal incomplete understanding of how carrying and borrowing work with hundreds.

### Finding 100 more and 100 less
*`MA-Y3-C006` · skill · complexity 2 · weight 2*

Finding 100 more or 100 less than any three-digit number requires understanding that only the hundreds digit changes (e.g. 346 + 100 = 446). This extends directly from finding 10 more/less by one column of place value. Mastery means a pupil can instantly identify 100 more or 100 less, including at boundaries such as 100 more than 900 = 1000.

**Teaching guidance:** Use Dienes blocks: adding a hundreds flat to a three-digit number shows the change physically. Connect to the hundred square pattern (one row down = 10 more; one full square = 100 more conceptually). Emphasise that the tens and ones digits do not change. Target the boundary: 100 more than 900 crosses into four digits (1000), which is an exciting moment to discuss. Practise in both directions.

**Key vocabulary:** hundred more, hundred less, hundreds digit, partition, place value, boundary

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often change the wrong digit: for 100 more than 324, some say 424 (correct) but others say 334 (changed tens) or 325 (changed ones). The boundary case of 100 more than 900 = 1000 can confuse pupils who think four-digit numbers do not exist yet.

### Place value in three-digit numbers ⭐ **keystone**
*`MA-Y3-C007` · knowledge · complexity 2 · weight 3*

Understanding that each digit in a three-digit number has a specific value determined by its position — hundreds, tens or ones — is the core of place value for Year 3. For example, in 347, the 3 represents 300, the 4 represents 40 and the 7 represents 7. Mastery means pupils can identify the value of any digit in a three-digit number, partition the number in standard form (347 = 300 + 40 + 7), and use this understanding to support all calculation strategies.

**Teaching guidance:** Use base-ten (Dienes) blocks as the primary concrete resource: hundreds flats, tens sticks and ones cubes model each place value position physically. Place value mats with columns for H, T and O support structured partitioning. Arrow cards (separate cards for 300, 40, 7 that slot together to form 347) show how digits combine and separate. Progress to place value charts and then to abstract representation. Always connect to the spoken number name.

**Key vocabulary:** hundreds, tens, ones, units, place value, digit, three-digit number, partition, value, represent

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils frequently confuse the digit with its value — saying the digit 3 in 347 'is worth 3' rather than 300. Pupils with insecure understanding may add the digits (3 + 4 + 7 = 14) rather than partitioning them. Zero as a place holder causes particular difficulty: in 307, the zero means 'no tens', but pupils often omit it when writing the number or misread it as 37.

### Partitioning three-digit numbers
*`MA-Y3-C008` · skill · complexity 2 · weight 2*

Partitioning is the process of splitting a number into its component parts according to place value (e.g. 347 = 300 + 40 + 7). In Year 3, pupils extend this from two-digit to three-digit numbers and also practise flexible (non-standard) partitioning (e.g. 347 = 300 + 47 or 270 + 77). Mastery means pupils can partition any three-digit number in multiple ways and use partitioning as a mental calculation strategy.

**Teaching guidance:** Arrow cards and Dienes blocks remain the most powerful tools. After establishing standard partitioning, introduce flexible partitioning through practical problems: if I have 3 hundreds and 14 tens, what number is that? Discuss: 3 hundreds and 14 tens = 3 hundreds + 1 hundred + 4 tens = 4 hundreds + 4 tens = 440. Flexible partitioning is directly needed for mental addition and subtraction strategies, so teaching it in that context makes the purpose clear.

**Key vocabulary:** partition, split, hundreds, tens, ones, standard, flexible, parts, whole, compose, decompose

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils can usually do standard partitioning but struggle with flexible partitioning (e.g. they cannot see that 347 = 300 + 47 = 250 + 97). They may also partition in writing but not connect it to mental arithmetic strategies. Some pupils think each partition is a different number rather than different ways of expressing the same number.

## Learner profile

### Content & language guidelines

- **Reading level**: Most children are independent readers of simple texts. Reading fluency varies widely. Decoding is largely automatic for common words.
- **Lexile range**: 150–350L
- **FK grade max**: 2
- **Max sentence length**: 14 words
- **TTS required**: No
- **Academic vocabulary**: Avoid

> **AI content instruction**: Use clear, active sentences with one idea per sentence. Subject vocabulary can be used if first introduced with a definition. Avoid passive voice. Metaphors and similes are helpful for abstract science concepts. Questions can require 1–3 word written answers or spoken responses.

### Pedagogy profile

- **Session length**: 12–20 minutes
- **Scaffolding**: moderate_to_high
- **Productive failure**: Appropriate ✓
- **Hint tiers**: max 3
- **Spacing interval**: 2–7 days
- **Session sequence**: challenge_problem → guided_exploration → worked_example → independent_practice → retrieval_practice
- **Active desirable difficulties**: spacing, interleaving

> **AI pedagogy instruction**: Start with a challenge problem — do not explain first. Let the child attempt independently for 2–3 minutes. Collect their attempt. Then show the worked example. Follow with 3–4 retrieval practice questions that mix this concept with previously mastered material (interleaving). Contextualize difficulty: 'That one was harder — your brain was working to connect different ideas.'

### Feedback profile

- **Style**: specific_competence
- **AI tone**: warm_competence_focused
- **Gamification**: ⚠ Not safe — avoid
- **Unexpected delight**: Safe ✓ (semi_random)
- **Explicit misconception correction**: Keep implicit
- **Metacognitive reflection**: Not yet
- **Example (correct)**: "You spotted the pattern — all the multiples of 6 end in an even number. That is a really useful thing to notice."
- **Example (incorrect)**: "That one got you — 7×8 trips up a lot of people. Here is a trick: 7×7 is 49, so 7×8 is just 7 more, which gives 56."
- **Avoid phrases**: "Wrong", "Incorrect", "You need to improve", "Well done!", "Amazing!"

> **AI feedback instruction**: Specific competence feedback: name the pattern, rule, or skill the child demonstrated. On error, explain the specific misconception (not just 'wrong') and give the reasoning to fix it. Normalize productive struggle: 'That one took longer — your brain was making new connections.' Never compare to other children or previous performance.

### Interaction types available

**Primary (preferred):**
- **Pattern Discovery — I Notice / I Wonder** (`pattern_discovery`, higher_order)
  > This is the productive failure activation phase — do NOT correct or evaluate observations during discovery. Say 'That is interesting, what else do you notice?' to all responses. After the discovery phase, connect the child's actual observations to the canonical concept: 'You noticed [X] — that is the [Y] pattern.'
- **Drag to Categorise** (`drag_categorise`, manipulation)
  > Limit to 2–3 categories for Y3, up to 4–5 for Y5+. Confirm whether items are mutually exclusive or can belong to multiple categories. In feedback, explain the classification principle, not just the correct placement.
- **Matching Pairs** (`matching_pairs`, manipulation)
  > Limit to 4–5 pairs for Y3–Y4, up to 6–8 pairs for Y5+. Distractors should be near-misses (similar terms, not obviously unrelated). After matching, display all correct pairs simultaneously before moving on.
- **Multiple Choice — 3 Options** (`multi_choice_3`, selection)
  > Provide 1 correct answer and 2 plausible distractors. Distractors should represent common misconceptions, not random wrong answers. Label A/B/C only if children are Y3+.
- **Multiple Choice — 4 Options** (`multi_choice_4`, selection)
  > 1 correct answer + 3 distractors. Each distractor should address a specific, documented misconception from the curriculum domain. Explain why the distractor is wrong in post-answer feedback.
- **Text Input — Single Word** (`text_input_word`, text_input)
  > Accept near-miss spellings (within 2 Levenshtein edits of the correct answer). Do not penalise spelling errors unless spelling is the assessed skill. Provide word-length hint (e.g. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ) if child makes 2 failed attempts.
