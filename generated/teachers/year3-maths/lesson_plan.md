## At a Glance

- This cluster builds the conceptual architecture for three-digit numbers: pupils learn that every digit in a number has a specific *value* determined by its *position* (hundreds, tens, ones) — not just its face value.
- Partitioning — both standard (347 = 300 + 40 + 7) and flexible (347 = 300 + 47) — is introduced as an active strategy pupils will use throughout all four operations.
- Finding 10 and 100 more or less than any three-digit number develops mental agility with the number system and directly supports estimation, mental addition, and subtraction.
- This is a keystone cluster: the graph flags it as a foundational prerequisite for all Year 3 calculation work, and mastery here directly gates the four-digit number work of Year 4.

## Curriculum Context

### Where this sits in the domain

The graph's rationale for this cluster is: *"Place value understanding (C007), partitioning (C008), and finding 10/100 more or less (C005, C006) are tightly bound by co_teach_hints. Together they build the core conceptual architecture for three-digit numbers."*

All clusters in `MA-Y3-D001` in sequence:

| Order | Cluster ID | Type | Title |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `MA-Y3-D001-CL001` | Introduction | Extend counting sequences in multiples of 4, 8, 50 and 100 |
| **2** | **`MA-Y3-D001-CL002`** | **Practice** | **Understand and apply place value in three-digit numbers** ← *this cluster* |
| 3 | `MA-Y3-D001-CL003` | Assessment | Assessment: Place value in three-digit numbers, Partitioning, Finding 10 more/less |
| 4 | `MA-Y3-D001-CL004` | Practice | Compare, order and estimate numbers to 1000 |

### What came before

In KS1, pupils worked with two-digit numbers: they partitioned numbers into tens and ones, found 10 more and 10 less, and added/subtracted two-digit numbers using a range of strategies. They also counted in multiples of 100 in the introductory cluster (`MA-Y3-D001-CL001`), which immediately precedes this one. That counting work gives pupils a feel for the scale of hundreds before they examine the internal structure of three-digit numbers.

### What comes next

This cluster feeds directly into the assessment cluster (`MA-Y3-D001-CL003`), which tests place value, partitioning, and finding 10 more/less. Beyond that, the domain continues with comparing, ordering, and estimating numbers to 1000 (`MA-Y3-D001-CL004`). Across Year 3, this cluster underpins every calculation domain — mental and written addition and subtraction both depend on pupils being able to partition three-digit numbers fluently. Looking further ahead, the four-digit number work of Year 4 is a direct extension of this cluster's concepts.

## Prerequisite Check

### What pupils must already know

Pupils entering this cluster should be secure with:

- **Adding and subtracting two-digit numbers** — understanding how tens and ones behave when calculating (from `MA-Y2-D002`).
- **The inverse relationship between addition and subtraction** — knowing that 10 more and 10 less are related (from `MA-Y2-D002`).
- **Counting in multiples of 100** — having a feel for the scale of 100, 200, 300 … 1000 (from `MA-Y3-D001-CL001`, which should already be taught).

### Quick readiness check (5 minutes, before Lesson 1)

Use these four oral or whiteboard questions at the start of your first session. Pupils who cannot answer these confidently need bridging support (see Adaptive Learning Notes):

1. *"What is 10 more than 57?"* (checks two-digit 10 more/less)
2. *"Partition 68 into tens and ones."* (checks two-digit partitioning)
3. *"Count on from 200 in hundreds: 200, 300, …"* (checks 100s counting)
4. *"I have 4 tens and 3 ones. What number am I?"* (checks place value language)

If more than a quarter of the class cannot answer Q1 and Q4, consider a short bridging session on two-digit place value before beginning Lesson 1 proper.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this cluster, pupils will be able to:

1. **Identify** the value of any digit in a three-digit number (e.g. in 347, the 4 represents 40).
2. **Partition** any three-digit number in standard form and in at least two flexible ways (e.g. 347 = 300 + 40 + 7; also 347 = 300 + 47).
3. **Calculate** 10 more and 10 less than any three-digit number, including boundary cases where the hundreds digit changes.
4. **Calculate** 100 more and 100 less than any three-digit number, including at the boundary of 1000.
5. **Apply** place value knowledge to explain and check mental calculations using partitioning as a strategy.

*Bloom's note: objectives 1–4 are at Identify/Calculate level, appropriate for consolidation in Y3. Objective 5 requires explanation, which is the Apply level and should be the challenge target for pupils working above expectation.*

## Key Vocabulary

The concepts in this cluster use the following vocabulary. For each term, the approach below specifies how to introduce it, how to display it, and how to reinforce it physically or visually.

### Vocabulary teaching sequence

Introduce terms in this order, adding each to a persistent classroom display as it appears in teaching:

| Term | When to introduce | Concrete / visual anchor |
|---|---|---|
| **digit** | Lesson 1, day 1 | Point to individual digits on a number card; distinguish digit (the symbol) from value (what it represents) |
| **hundreds, tens, ones / units** | Lesson 1, day 1 | Dienes flats (hundreds), sticks (tens), small cubes (ones) placed under H / T / O column headers |
| **place value** | Lesson 1, day 1 | "The *value* of a digit depends on its *place*" — show 3 in 347 (=300) vs. 3 in 37 (=30) |
| **value** | Lesson 1, day 1 | Arrow cards: physically separate 347 into 300, 40, 7 cards |
| **three-digit number** | Lesson 1, day 1 | Build and name numbers with Dienes — count the columns |
| **partition / split** | Lesson 2 | Dienes blocks physically separated into groups; arrow cards pulled apart |
| **compose / decompose** | Lesson 2 | Combine and separate Dienes blocks; connect to partition as synonyms |
| **standard partitioning** | Lesson 2 | Arrow cards showing 300 + 40 + 7 only |
| **flexible partitioning** | Lesson 3 | "Can we split it a different way?" — Dienes re-grouped |
| **ten more / ten less** | Lesson 4 | Adding or removing a tens stick from a Dienes representation |
| **hundred more / hundred less** | Lesson 5 | Adding or removing a hundreds flat |
| **boundary** | Lessons 4–5 | Highlighted on number line — the point where a digit changes column |
| **increase / decrease** | Lessons 4–5 | Arrow direction on a number line scrubber |

### Displaying vocabulary

Maintain a maths vocabulary wall or working wall section dedicated to this cluster. Each term should appear with:
- The word in large print
- A simple definition in a single sentence (max 14 words, no passive voice)
- A small visual (e.g. a sketch of Dienes blocks next to "hundreds")

Remove terms from display before assessment to assess retention, not reading.

## Common Misconceptions

These are the four documented misconceptions across the concepts in this cluster. Each has a specific diagnostic question and a targeted intervention.

---

### Misconception 1: Digit value confusion — "The 3 in 347 is worth 3"

**What pupils do:** They name the face value of the digit rather than its place value. Asked "What is the value of the 3 in 347?" they say "3" instead of "300".

**Why it happens:** In everyday life, the numeral 3 always means three objects. The additional layer of positional meaning is new and non-intuitive.

**Diagnostic question:** *"I have the number 347. What is the 4 worth? Show me with Dienes blocks."* A pupil with this misconception will place 4 ones cubes, not 4 tens sticks.

**Intervention:** Return to the concrete. Place 347 in Dienes on a place value mat. Point to the tens column: count the sticks — there are 4 sticks, each worth 10, so the value is 40. Repeat with arrow cards: pull apart the 347 arrow card to reveal 300, 40, 7 separately.

---

### Misconception 2: Zero as a placeholder — reading 307 as 37

**What pupils do:** They omit or misread the zero in numbers like 307, reading it as 37, or write 37 when asked to record "three hundred and seven".

**Why it happens:** Pupils understand zero as "nothing" and so skip the tens column entirely, not recognising zero's role in holding the column open.

**Diagnostic question:** *"Build 307 with Dienes blocks, then write the number."* Pupils with this misconception leave the tens column empty on the place value mat and write 37.

**Intervention:** Build 307 on a H/T/O mat with Dienes. Point to the empty tens column: "How many tens do we have? Zero tens. We need to write a zero here to show the tens column is empty — otherwise the hundreds and the ones would be in the wrong places." Use arrow cards: 300 + 0 (or show a 00 card) + 7.

---

### Misconception 3: Boundary error for 10 more — "10 more than 196 is 1096"

**What pupils do:** When the tens digit is 9, adding 10 makes them append a 1 to the front of the number rather than recognising that the tens column overflows into hundreds.

**Why it happens:** Pupils are applying an additive rule (add 1 to the front) without understanding the regrouping mechanism.

**Diagnostic question:** *"What is 10 more than 196?"* Ask pupils to show the answer on a number line scrubber and with Dienes before writing.

**Intervention:** Build 196 in Dienes. Physically add a tens stick. Now count the tens sticks: 10 sticks — can we exchange? 10 tens = 1 hundred. Exchange the 10 sticks for a hundreds flat. Read the result: 2 hundreds, 0 tens, 6 ones = 206. Record: 196 + 10 = 206.

---

### Misconception 4: Flexible partitioning — "That's a different number"

**What pupils do:** When shown that 347 = 300 + 47, they think this is a different number from 347 = 300 + 40 + 7. They resist non-standard partitions as "wrong".

**Why it happens:** Standard partitioning has been presented as the single correct method, so alternative representations feel incorrect.

**Diagnostic question:** *"Is 300 + 47 the same as 347? How do you know?"* Pupils with this misconception say no or are uncertain.

**Intervention:** Use Dienes blocks to build 347 in standard form. Ask: "Can I re-arrange the tens sticks and ones cubes without changing the total?" Physically group 4 tens sticks and 7 cubes together (= 47) and keep the 3 flats (= 300). Count the total — still 347. The blocks did not change, only the way we grouped them did.

---

## Lesson Sequence

This cluster is designed for 9 lessons across approximately 3 weeks. The lessons below are grouped into five distinct teaching episodes. The Y3 pedagogy profile specifies the session sequence: **challenge problem → guided exploration → worked example → independent practice → retrieval practice**. This sequence is embedded within each lesson.

The pedagogy profile confirms that **productive failure is appropriate for Y3**. Each lesson therefore opens with a challenge problem that pupils attempt *before* instruction. This is deliberate: the struggle activates prior knowledge and creates a need to learn, making the subsequent worked example more memorable.

---

### Lesson 1: What does each digit represent? (Place value in three-digit numbers — C007)

**Duration:** 60 minutes
**Main concept:** `MA-Y3-C007` Place value in three-digit numbers (keystone)

#### Phase 1: Challenge problem (10 min) — Productive failure activation

Write this on the board without explanation:

> *"Here is the number 347. A pupil says: 'The 4 is worth 4.' Is this true? Write down what you think the 4 is worth, and be ready to explain."*

Pupils work independently for 3–4 minutes. Do not correct. Circulate and make brief notes on the range of answers (4, 40, four tens). Collect whiteboards. This is the productive failure moment — pupils are activating their KS1 knowledge and discovering where it reaches its limits.

**Interaction type: Pattern Discovery (pattern_discovery)**
Use the "I Notice / I Wonder" frame: "What do you notice about the number 347? Write down three things you notice." Do NOT evaluate responses — say "That is interesting, what else do you notice?" to all. After the phase, connect observations to the concept: "You noticed the 3 is at the front — that is the hundreds place."

#### Phase 2: Guided exploration (15 min)

Distribute Dienes blocks and H/T/O place value mats. Build the number 347 together as a class.

*Guided questions:*
- "How many hundreds flats did we need? What does that tell us about the 3?"
- "How many tens sticks? So what is the 4 actually worth?"
- "How many ones cubes? So the 7 is worth just 7."

Introduce arrow cards: show how 347 splits into 300, 40, and 7 cards that slot together to form 347. Pupils build three numbers of their own choosing with Dienes, then use arrow cards to separate them.

**Interaction type: Place Value Blocks (place_value_blocks)**
On the AI platform, use the Place Value Blocks tool at this stage. Pupils drag hundreds flats, tens sticks, and ones cubes onto a H/T/O mat to build and read numbers. The tool should display the number formed and allow pupils to highlight individual digits and see their values.

#### Phase 3: Worked example (10 min)

Model explicitly with 503 (a boundary number with a zero placeholder):

1. Build 503 in Dienes on the mat.
2. Name each column: "5 hundreds flats in the hundreds column — the 5 is worth 500."
3. "0 tens sticks in the tens column — we must write a zero here to show the column is empty."
4. "3 ones cubes — the 3 is worth 3."
5. Write: 503 = 500 + 0 + 3. Show the arrow card with a 00 card to represent zero tens.

*Address misconception 2 directly*: "If we forgot to write the zero, what number would we have? 53 — that is a completely different, much smaller number. The zero is doing an important job."

#### Phase 4: Independent practice (15 min)

Pupils work through a set of 8–10 numbers, building each with Dienes and recording the value of a specified digit. Include at least two numbers with zero in tens or ones position.

**Interaction type: Matching Pairs (matching_pairs)**
Match 4–5 three-digit numbers to their partitioned form (e.g. 347 ↔ 300 + 40 + 7). Distractors should be near-misses: e.g. 347 ↔ 30 + 40 + 7 (wrong value for hundreds).

| Support | Core | Challenge |
|---|---|---|
| Given the Dienes already built; write the number and partition | Build from scratch, record value of each digit | Write the digit that has value 40 in 345, 403, 240, 142 |

#### Phase 5: Retrieval practice (10 min)

3–4 interleaved questions mixing this concept with prerequisite knowledge:

1. *"What is 10 more than 58?"* (KS1 prerequisite)
2. *"What is the value of the 6 in 463?"*
3. *"Write three different three-digit numbers where the hundreds digit is 5."*
4. *"In 307, what is the zero for?"*

---

### Lesson 2: Standard and Flexible Partitioning (C008)

**Duration:** 60 minutes
**Main concept:** `MA-Y3-C008` Partitioning three-digit numbers

#### Phase 1: Challenge problem (10 min)

> *"347 = 300 + 40 + 7. True or false? Also: is 347 = 300 + 47? Write down your thinking."*

The second part is the productive failure hook — pupils are likely to say "false" because 300 + 47 "doesn't look right". Collect responses without comment.

#### Phase 2: Guided exploration (15 min)

Return to Dienes and mats. Build 347. Establish standard partition. Then:

"I'm going to re-group these blocks without adding or removing any." Physically push the 4 tens sticks and 7 cubes together. "What do these represent together?" (47.) "And the flats?" (300.) "So 347 = 300 + 47. Same blocks, different grouping."

Try 347 = 250 + 97 together: exchange 1 hundreds flat for 10 tens sticks, then group. This is cognitively stretching — treat it as guided exploration, not expectation for all.

**Interaction type: Drag to Categorise (drag_categorise)**
Present a set of partitions: some are correct ways to partition 347, some are incorrect. Pupils drag each into "Is 347" or "Is not 347". Confirm that multiple correct partitions exist — they are all the same number.

#### Phase 3: Worked example (10 min)

Model the full sequence for 462:
- Standard: 462 = 400 + 60 + 2
- Flexible A: 462 = 400 + 62
- Flexible B: 462 = 460 + 2
- Flexible C: 462 = 360 + 102 (exchange 1 hundred flat for 10 sticks)

*Address misconception 4*: "These all equal 462. They are not different numbers — they are different ways of looking at the same number, like different ways of making a sandwich with the same filling."

#### Phase 4: Independent practice (15 min)

Pupils partition 4–5 three-digit numbers in at least two ways each. Include one number with a zero.

**Interaction type: Text Input — Single Word (text_input_word)**
Prompt: "427 = 400 + __ + 7." Pupils type the missing value. Accept "20" and "twenty" as correct. If a pupil makes two failed attempts, provide the word-length hint.

| Support | Core | Challenge |
|---|---|---|
| Given standard partition; find one flexible alternative | Write 3 partitions independently | Prove that 350 + 97 = 447 using Dienes, then find a third partition |

#### Phase 5: Retrieval practice (10 min)

1. *"What is the value of the 8 in 586?"* (C007 retrieval)
2. *"Partition 309 in standard form."* (includes zero)
3. *"Give two ways to partition 520."*
4. *"Count back from 700 in 100s: 700, …"* (CL001 retrieval — interleaving)

---

### Lesson 3: Finding 10 More and 10 Less (C005)

**Duration:** 60 minutes
**Main concept:** `MA-Y3-C005` Finding 10 more and 10 less

#### Phase 1: Challenge problem (10 min)

Write on the board:

> *"What is 10 more than 196? Write your answer and explain what changes in the number."*

Expect the boundary misconception to surface here. Collect whiteboards. Look for "1096" or "206" — do not comment yet.

#### Phase 2: Guided exploration (15 min)

Use a 0–1000 number line displayed prominently. Mark 246 with a counter. "If I add 10, where does my counter land?" Move it. Pupils notice only the tens digit changed: 246 → 256.

Work through a chain: 246, 256, 266, 276, 286, 296, 306. Pause at the 296 → 306 boundary. "Something different happened here — what is it?"

**Interaction type: Number Line — Drag Marker (number_line_scrubber)**
Pupils use the number line scrubber tool to jump +10 and −10 from given numbers. The tool should snap to decade marks and highlight the digit that changed after each move. Pupils record the pattern: "The tens digit changes. Except at boundaries."

#### Phase 3: Worked example (10 min)

Model the boundary case explicitly using Dienes:

*"10 more than 196:"*
1. Build 196: 1 flat, 9 sticks, 6 cubes.
2. Add a tens stick: now 1 flat, 10 sticks, 6 cubes.
3. "Can we exchange 10 tens for a hundred?" Yes. Exchange: 2 flats, 0 sticks, 6 cubes.
4. Read: 206.

Write on the board: 196 + 10 = 206. Tens digit was 9, now 0; hundreds digit was 1, now 2.

*Address misconception 3*: Display the wrong answer "1096" and ask "What happened here? Where did the 1 come from?" Lead pupils to see this was adding a 1 to the front rather than carrying.

*"10 less than 300:"*
1. Build 300: 3 flats, 0 sticks, 0 cubes.
2. "We need to remove a tens stick, but we have none. What can we exchange?" Exchange 1 flat for 10 sticks: 2 flats, 10 sticks, 0 cubes.
3. Remove 1 stick: 2 flats, 9 sticks, 0 cubes = 290.

#### Phase 4: Independent practice (15 min)

A set of 10 questions: 6 non-boundary and 4 boundary cases (tens digit 0 or 9).

**Interaction type: Multiple Choice — 4 Options (multi_choice_4)**
Present the question "What is 10 more than 293?" with options:
- A: 303 (correct)
- B: 1293 (misconception 3 — appending 1)
- C: 203 (subtracted 10 instead of adding)
- D: 293 (no change — did not compute)

After the answer, explain why the distractor is wrong, not just which is correct.

| Support | Core | Challenge |
|---|---|---|
| Dienes provided; non-boundary only | Mix of boundary and non-boundary | Chain: 10 more/less five times from a starting number; predict the end without calculating each step |

#### Phase 5: Retrieval practice (10 min)

1. *"Partition 438 in standard form."* (C008 retrieval)
2. *"What is 10 more than 490?"* (boundary)
3. *"What is 10 less than 201?"* (boundary)
4. *"What is the value of the 0 in 305?"* (C007 — zero placeholder)

---

### Lesson 4: Finding 100 More and 100 Less (C006)

**Duration:** 60 minutes
**Main concept:** `MA-Y3-C006` Finding 100 more and 100 less

#### Phase 1: Challenge problem (10 min)

> *"What is 100 more than 900? Write your answer. What happens to the number?"*

This is the four-digit boundary. Expect some pupils to say "9100" or "1000" — both are interesting and worth exploring. Collect responses.

#### Phase 2: Guided exploration (15 min)

Build a parallel structure to Lesson 3. Use the number line scrubber jumping in 100s. Ask pupils: "What changes and what stays the same?"

Work through 346 → 446 → 546 → 646 → 746 → 846 → 946 → 1046. Discuss: "Does 1046 make sense? We have never spoken about it. Is it a real number?" (Yes — and it is a four-digit number, which Year 4 will study fully.)

**Interaction type: Place Value Blocks (place_value_blocks)**
Add and remove hundreds flats from the Dienes display. Pupils build the before number, add a flat, and read the after number. The tool's visual change should make it clear that only the hundreds column changes.

#### Phase 3: Worked example (10 min)

Model 100 more than 347, 100 less than 400 (boundary), and 100 more than 900 (four-digit boundary):

- *"347 + 100:"* Add 1 flat. Hundreds: 3 → 4. Tens and ones unchanged. Answer: 447.
- *"400 − 100:"* Remove 1 flat. Hundreds: 4 → 3. Answer: 300.
- *"900 + 100:"* Add 1 flat. Now 10 flats. Exchange for a thousands block (show or represent as a new column). Answer: 1000. "This is one thousand — the first four-digit number. Year 4 will explore this fully."

*Address misconception for wrong-digit changes*: Show 324. Ask "If I want 100 more, which digit changes?" Display options: changing tens (334), changing ones (325), or changing hundreds (424). Only 424 is correct. "The hundreds digit changes when we add a hundred."

#### Phase 4: Independent practice (15 min)

10 questions mixing +100 and −100 with a range of starting numbers, including two boundary cases.

**Interaction type: Multiple Choice — 3 Options (multi_choice_3)**
*"What is 100 more than 324?"*
- A: 424 (correct)
- B: 334 (changed tens — wrong-digit misconception)
- C: 325 (changed ones — wrong-digit misconception)

Label A/B/C as pupils are Y3+ (confirmed in interaction type notes).

| Support | Core | Challenge |
|---|---|---|
| Dienes mat provided; start with 100 more only | Both + and − 100; includes boundaries | Write a rule: "When you add 100 to a three-digit number, the ___ digit changes, unless ___." |

#### Phase 5: Retrieval practice (10 min)

1. *"What is 10 less than 340?"* (C005 retrieval)
2. *"What is 100 more than 761?"*
3. *"Partition 805 in two different ways."* (C008 — interleaving)
4. *"Count in 50s from 150."* (CL001 — interleaving from prior cluster)

---

### Lessons 5–6: Consolidation and flexible application

**Duration:** 2 × 60 minutes
**Concepts:** All four (`MA-Y3-C005`, `C006`, `C007`, `C008`)

These two lessons bring all four concepts together in connected activities. The goal is fluency and the ability to use all four skills in combination.

#### Activity 1: "Mystery number" reasoning chains (Lesson 5)

Pose problems that require pupils to use multiple concepts:

> *"I start with a number. I partition it: 400 + 80 + 3. Then I find 10 more. Then I find 100 less. What number am I left with?"*

Pupils must partition, then apply +10, then apply −100. Answer: 483 → 493 → 393.

**Interaction type: Pattern Discovery (pattern_discovery)**
"I notice / I wonder" applied to a hundred square extended to 999. What patterns do pupils notice about adding 10 (moving one row down) vs. adding 100 (moving one page right)? Connect their observations to the underlying place value structure.

#### Activity 2: Flexible partitioning for mental calculation (Lesson 5)

Explicitly connect flexible partitioning to calculation strategy:

> *"To add 347 + 200 mentally, I partition: 300 + 47. Then I add 200 to the 300: 500 + 47 = 547."*

This is the bridge from this cluster to the addition and subtraction domains that follow.

#### Activity 3: Rapid-fire retrieval (Lesson 6)

A 10-minute rapid-fire round at the start of Lesson 6 (spaced one week from Lessons 1–2). Pupils answer on mini-whiteboards:

- 5 digit-value questions
- 5 partition questions (including one flexible)
- 5 "10 more/less" questions (including 2 boundary)
- 5 "100 more/less" questions (including 1 four-digit boundary)

**Interaction type: Drag to Categorise (drag_categorise)**
Present 12 numbers. Pupils categorise them into: "Has a zero in tens place", "Hundreds digit is larger than ones digit", "10 more would change the hundreds digit". Limit to 3 categories as per the Y3 interaction type guidance.

#### Activity 4: Concept mapper connection (Lesson 6)

Pupils create a visual summary connecting the four concepts. Prompt structure:

- Place value in three-digit numbers is needed for… (partitioning)
- Partitioning helps us… (flexible calculation, +10, +100)
- Finding 10 more uses… (tens digit, boundaries)
- Finding 100 more uses… (hundreds digit, boundaries)

This metacognitive task is at the edge of what Y3 can manage — treat it as a class or group activity, not independent. The feedback profile notes that metacognitive reflection is "not yet" fully appropriate, so structure this as a teacher-led discussion rather than a pupil-written reflection.

### Lessons 7–9: Spaced retrieval and pre-assessment consolidation

These three lessons are distributed across the following week (2–7 days after Lessons 5–6, consistent with the `spacing_interval_days` of 2–7 days specified in the pedagogy profile).

**Lesson 7:** Focus on the keystone concept (`C007` — place value) and zero placeholder. Use the diagnostic questions from the Prerequisite Check plus new numbers not previously seen.

**Lesson 8:** Focus on boundary cases for +10/−10 and +100/−100. Use a competition-style rapid-fire format (but note: the feedback profile says gamification is NOT safe for Y3 — frame this as "beating your own score from last time" rather than competing with peers).

**Lesson 9:** Mixed practice across all four concepts, mirroring the format of the assessment cluster (`MA-Y3-D001-CL003`) that follows. This is a low-stakes preparation session, not a test.

## Assessment and Feedback

### Formative assessment strategies by lesson

| Lesson | Strategy | Look for |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Whiteboard show (value of a named digit) | Misconception 1 (face value); Misconception 2 (zero) |
| 2 | Drag-to-categorise (correct partitions) | Misconception 4 (flexible partition = different number) |
| 3 | Multi-choice (10 more boundary) | Misconception 3 (appending 1) |
| 4 | Multi-choice (100 more — which digit?) | Wrong-digit error |
| 5–6 | Reasoning chains and rapid-fire | Fluency and transfer |
| 7–9 | Spaced retrieval questions | Retention vs. recency |

The keystone concept is `MA-Y3-C007` (place value in three-digit numbers). Before moving to the assessment cluster, every pupil should be able to answer the keystone question: *"What is the value of the [specified] digit in [three-digit number]?"* without Dienes support. If a pupil cannot do this independently, they are not ready for the assessment cluster — continue with targeted support using Dienes and arrow cards before proceeding.

### Feedback language

The feedback profile for Y3 specifies **specific_competence** style with a **warm_competence_focused** tone.

**When a pupil is correct, use language like:**

- *"You spotted that the zero holds the tens column open — that is a really important thing to understand about place value."*
- *"You got that boundary right — 196 + 10 = 206. You noticed the tens column overflowed, and you carried it into the hundreds. That is exactly the reasoning."*
- *"You found three different ways to partition 347 and showed they all equal the same number. That kind of flexible thinking is what mathematicians do."*

(Pattern: name the specific skill or pattern the pupil demonstrated — not "Well done!" or "Amazing!")

**When a pupil makes an error, use language like:**

- *"That one caught a lot of people — when the tens digit is 9, adding 10 does not just add a 1 to the front. Here is what happens: the tens column fills up and exchanges for a hundred. So 196 + 10 = 206, not 1096."*
- *"The 4 in 347 trips people up — it looks like it should be worth 4, but its position in the tens column means it is actually worth 40. Try it with Dienes and count the sticks."*

(Pattern: explain the specific misconception, give the correct reasoning, and redirect to the concrete — do not say "Wrong" or "Incorrect".)

**Phrases to actively avoid** (from the feedback profile):
- "Wrong"
- "Incorrect"
- "You need to improve"
- "Well done!"
- "Amazing!"

When a lesson is particularly difficult, normalise the struggle: *"That one took some thinking — your brain was making new connections between hundreds and tens. That is the hard part of place value."*

### Keystone mastery check

Because `MA-Y3-C007` is flagged as a keystone concept, it warrants an explicit mastery gate before moving to the assessment cluster. Use this exit ticket at the end of Lesson 6 or 7:

1. *"Write the value of each digit in 583."* (Must be correct without Dienes.)
2. *"Write 307 in digits."* (Tests zero placeholder.)
3. *"Partition 583 in two ways."*

Pupils who cannot complete all three items without Dienes are not yet at mastery. Do not move them to the assessment cluster — use Lessons 7–9 for targeted consolidation with continued concrete support.

## Adaptive Learning Notes (for the AI system)

### If a pupil is struggling with place value

The primary intervention pathway is always: concrete → pictorial → abstract.

1. **Return to Dienes** — build the number physically on a H/T/O mat before any written or digital activity.
2. **Slow down arrow cards** — separate and re-join cards one column at a time, naming the value aloud each time.
3. **Use the Place Value Blocks tool** (`place_value_blocks`) in the AI platform — drag flats, sticks, and cubes into columns; the tool names the resulting number.
4. **Reduce number complexity** — work with numbers up to 399 before the full 0–999 range.
5. If zero-placeholder confusion persists, focus specifically on numbers in the form X0Y (e.g. 307, 405, 802) with Dienes that explicitly show an empty tens column.

### Hint tier structure

The pedagogy profile specifies **max 3 hint tiers**. Structure hints for this cluster as follows:

| Tier | Trigger | Hint content |
|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 | First wrong attempt | "Think about which column this digit is in." |
| Tier 2 | Second wrong attempt | "Try building the number with Dienes blocks — count the sticks in the tens column." |
| Tier 3 | Third wrong attempt | Show the worked example step-by-step with the specific number. Do not re-ask the question after Tier 3 — move on and revisit in the next session. |

### Spaced retrieval schedule

The pedagogy profile specifies a **spacing interval of 2–7 days**. Implement as follows:

- Introduce a concept → revisit after 2 days (short gap, strong encoding)
- Second revisit → 5–7 days after the first revisit
- Pre-assessment revisit → 7 days after the second revisit

This maps naturally onto the lesson sequence: Lessons 1–4 introduce concepts in Week 1; Lessons 5–6 consolidate in Week 2 (2–5 day gap); Lessons 7–9 do spaced retrieval in Week 3 (5–7 day gap).

For interleaving: from Lesson 3 onwards, every retrieval practice block should include at least one question from a *previously mastered* concept — including KS1 prerequisites (two-digit place value, counting in 100s).

### Desirable difficulties in use

The active desirable difficulties for Y3 are **spacing** and **interleaving** (from the pedagogy profile).

- **Spacing**: The gap between Lesson 2 and the Lesson 7 retrieval session is the primary spacing mechanism. Do not re-teach in Lesson 7 — ask pupils to recall before showing worked examples.
- **Interleaving**: From Lesson 3 onwards, each retrieval practice block mixes place value, partitioning, and 10/100 more/less questions. Do not group by concept in retrieval.
- **Productive failure**: Used in the challenge-problem phase of Lessons 1–4. Pupils attempt the problem independently before instruction. The Y3 pedagogy profile confirms this is appropriate. After collecting attempts, connect pupils' actual responses to the canonical concept: "You tried [their answer] — that is using [their reasoning]. Here is what actually happens."

## Links to Next Learning

Completing this cluster with secure mastery unlocks the following:

- **Assessment cluster** (`MA-Y3-D001-CL003`): The direct next step tests all four concepts from this cluster. Pupils should not enter the assessment cluster without keystone mastery of `MA-Y3-C007`.
- **Compare, order and estimate** (`MA-Y3-D001-CL004`): Ordering three-digit numbers requires pupils to compare digits by column — which depends directly on place value understanding from this cluster.
- **Year 3 addition and subtraction**: Mental strategies for adding and subtracting three-digit numbers (e.g. 347 + 200 = 547) require flexible partitioning (`C008`). Written column addition requires understanding that digits in the same column share the same place value (`C007`).
- **Year 4 four-digit numbers**: The hundreds digit in a three-digit number is the direct precursor to the thousands digit in a four-digit number. The boundary moment of 100 more than 900 = 1000 (explored in `C006`) is the concrete introduction to four-digit numbers.

The graph's keystone flag on `MA-Y3-C007` signals that this cluster's place value concept is load-bearing for the entire Year 3 mathematics programme. Treat mastery here as a prerequisite, not an aspiration.
