## Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. Header and Metadata

Clean and accurate in most respects. Subject (English), Key Stage (KS1), Year group (Y1), study type (Genre Study), and status (Mandatory) are all correct. The statutory reference — "Reading - Comprehension (Y1): listening to and discussing a wide range of poems, stories and non-fiction" — correctly identifies the reading programme of study.

One significant error: the source document reads "Art and Design (KS1/KS2) - National Curriculum Programme of Study." This is obviously wrong for a Y1 English planner. The source document should reference the English Programme of Study. This is the same kind of generator error Mr. Kowalski flagged — the source document field appears to be mislabelled by the auto-generator.

No estimated duration. For a Y1 Billy Goats Gruff unit, I would plan 1-2 weeks (5-8 lessons). The planner gives no guidance on scope.

**Rating:** Good structure, but the Art source document error is jarring.

### 2. Enquiry Questions

No enquiry questions are present. For KS1 English, enquiry questions are less standard than in KS2, but a simple framing question such as "What makes a good story?" or "Why do we retell stories?" would help focus the unit. Not a critical omission at this level, but it would add purpose.

**Rating:** Missing but less impactful at KS1 than KS2.

### 3. Concept Quality and Differentiation

This is excellent — the best section of the planner and a major upgrade from V7.

The primary concept — "Narrative sequencing" (EN-KS1-C045) — is well chosen for a Billy Goats Gruff unit. The description is accurate: "Ordering sentences to create a coherent story." The teaching weight (3/6) correctly signals this is a substantive concept requiring dedicated teaching time. The teaching guidance is practical and specific to Y1: "Start with retelling familiar stories before moving to original narratives. In Year 1, aim for 3-4 sequenced sentences."

The differentiation table is outstanding for KS1:

- **Entry:** "Writing two or three sentences about the same topic in order, with picture support" — exactly right for the lowest-attaining Y1 writers. The example task (writing about three pictures) is immediately usable. The common error ("Writing sentences about different, unrelated topics") is precisely what I see from my children who have not yet grasped that writing tells a connected story.
- **Developing:** "Writing a short narrative in order using time connectives" — the key progression step. The common error ("Using the same connective for every sentence") is so accurate it made me smile. "Then... then... then..." is the Y1 default.
- **Expected:** "Writing a short narrative with a clear beginning, middle and end" — matches the NC expectation. The common error ("Writing a detailed beginning but rushing or omitting the ending") describes about half my class.
- **Greater depth:** "Writing narratives with a developed plot including a problem and resolution, using varied connectives and building tension" — this is ambitious for Y1 but appropriate for greater depth. The common error about resolving problems too quickly is insightful.

I am particularly impressed that the example tasks are pitched correctly for Y1. "Write a short story about a character who finds something unexpected" is a task my Y1 children could attempt. V7 had no differentiation data for English at all — this is transformative.

The six secondary concepts are well selected for a KS1 retelling unit: story structure (EN-KS1-C018), oral rehearsal (EN-KS1-C043), sentence composition (EN-KS1-C044), sentence boundaries (EN-KS1-C052), capital letters (EN-KS1-C053), and full stops (EN-KS1-C054). This is exactly the set of skills a Y1 child needs to retell Billy Goats Gruff in writing. The oral rehearsal concept is particularly important — saying sentences out loud before writing them is the bridge from speaking to writing that Y1 depends on. I am glad to see it here as a named concept.

**Rating:** Excellent. The differentiation table alone makes this planner worthwhile.

### 4. Subject-Specific Content

The "Text type and features" section is strong and KS1-appropriate:

- **Text type:** Fiction
- **Features to teach:** repeated refrain ("Trip, trap, trip, trap"), rule of three (three goats, three attempts), good versus evil (goats versus troll), beginning-middle-end structure

These are exactly the features of Billy Goats Gruff that Y1 children should learn. The repeated refrain is the hook for oral rehearsal and retelling — children love chanting "Trip, trap, trip, trap" and this is how the story moves from listening to writing. The "rule of three" is a concept many Y1 teachers teach explicitly but rarely see named in planning resources.

The **writing outcome** is well-pitched: "Retell the story in 4-6 sentences using the repeated refrain and sequencing words (first, then, next, finally)." For Y1, 4-6 sentences is the right scope. Specifying both the refrain and the sequencing words tells the child exactly what to include.

The **grammar focus** (joining words, sequencing words, capital letters and full stops, from Y1 Appendix 2) is correct and appropriately simple. This is not a grammar-heavy unit — it is a narrative unit with grammar embedded naturally.

The **literary terms** (character, setting, beginning, middle, end) are the right level for Y1. No over-ambitious vocabulary here.

The **suggested texts** section lists only one text: "The Three Billy Goats Gruff (Traditional, various illustrators)" with the note "Use a version with clear, large illustrations for shared reading." This is fine — the unit IS the text. But the annotation could be more helpful. Which illustrators are recommended? The Ladybird classic version, the Paul Galdone version, the Stephen Carpenter version, and the Mary Finch version all have different strengths. For a KS1 teacher choosing a text for shared reading, the illustrations matter enormously — they are how Y1 children access the story.

I would also expect one or two comparison texts: another traditional tale with a similar structure (The Three Little Pigs, Goldilocks) for children to compare rule-of-three patterns across stories. The planner names Billy Goats Gruff in isolation without connecting it to the wider traditional tales genre.

**Rating:** Strong. Writing outcome and text features are well-pitched for KS1.

### 5. Thinking Lenses

There is no thinking lens section. As with Mr. Kowalski's planner, the V7 cluster context included a named lens (Patterns) with usable question stems. The V8 planner does not surface any lens.

For Billy Goats Gruff, a "Patterns" lens would work well: "What patterns can you spot in this story? What happens each time a goat crosses the bridge? Why does the storyteller repeat the pattern?" These questions are directly appropriate for Y1 oral discussion and would support the rule-of-three teaching.

**Rating:** Missing. A loss from V7.

### 6. Session Structure / Vehicle Templates

No session structure is provided. For a KS1 unit, the session structure is particularly important because Y1 lessons are shorter (30-45 minutes), the reading-writing ratio is different (more reading, less independent writing), and oral rehearsal needs explicit time allocation.

A typical Y1 Billy Goats Gruff unit would follow:

- Lessons 1-2: Shared reading, retelling with actions, learning the refrain
- Lesson 3: Story mapping (drawing the story in sequence)
- Lesson 4: Oral rehearsal — saying sentences aloud before writing
- Lesson 5: Modelled writing — teacher writes the retelling, children contribute
- Lessons 6-7: Independent writing — children write their own retelling
- Lesson 8: Sharing and celebrating — children read their stories aloud

None of this is in the planner. The VehicleTemplate nodes in the graph (24 templates with TEMPLATE_FOR KeyStage) could provide this structure for a Genre Study at KS1, but they are not surfaced.

**Rating:** Missing. More critical at KS1 than KS2 because Y1 lessons need tighter structure.

### 7. Cross-Curricular Opportunities

There is no cross-curricular section in this planner. Billy Goats Gruff has rich cross-curricular potential for KS1:

- **Art:** Making troll masks, painting the bridge and meadow setting
- **DT:** Building a bridge (strong enough for the biggest billy goat?)
- **Drama:** Role-playing the story, freeze frames, hot-seating the troll
- **Maths:** Counting in threes, comparing sizes (small, medium, large)
- **PSHE:** Standing up to bullies, helping each other

These are standard KS1 cross-curricular connections that most Y1 teachers would plan. Their absence is noticeable — a planner that stops at English misses how KS1 teaching works in practice, where a core text drives learning across the whole week.

**Rating:** Missing entirely. Significant gap for KS1 planning.

### 8. Sequencing

The planner states "Leads to: Traditional Tales: Little Red Riding Hood." This is a sensible progression — from a story with a repeated pattern and a simple conflict to one with a more developed narrative arc. There is no "Follows" entry.

The sequencing suggests the planner knows about a sequence of traditional tale units within KS1 English, which is promising. I would want to see the full sequence: what came before Billy Goats Gruff, and what comes after Little Red Riding Hood? A Y1 traditional tales progression might be: The Enormous Turnip (cumulative tale) -> Billy Goats Gruff (rule of three) -> Little Red Riding Hood (problem-resolution) -> Jack and the Beanstalk (quest narrative).

**Rating:** Minimal but the connection to Little Red Riding Hood is correct and useful.

### 9. Pitfalls, Sensitive Content, Success Criteria

The three pitfalls are practical and KS1-specific:

1. "Spending too long on drama and retelling without moving to written output" — this is the most common Y1 planning error. Children love acting out Billy Goats Gruff and teachers can spend three lessons on drama without any writing happening. This pitfall correctly identifies the balance needed.
2. "Not explicitly teaching the story structure (beginning, middle, end) as a transferable pattern" — yes. The whole point of teaching Billy Goats Gruff is not to learn this one story, but to learn story structure as a tool for writing. Teachers who do not make this explicit miss the purpose of the unit.
3. "Writing task too ambitious for Y1 — keep to 4-6 sentences" — this is essential guidance. Some teachers set Y1 children a task of "retell the whole story" and get one sentence from their lower attainers and three pages from their higher attainers. Specifying 4-6 sentences sets a realistic expectation.

All three pitfalls show genuine understanding of KS1 English teaching. They are specific to this unit, not generic.

There is no sensitive content section. Billy Goats Gruff involves a troll who threatens to eat the goats, and the largest goat "pokes out the troll's eyes" and "crushed him to bits" in some versions. For some Y1 children, this can be frightening. A brief note about choosing a version with appropriate levels of violence, or about handling children's responses to the threatening troll, would be helpful.

There are no explicit success criteria. The writing outcome serves as an implicit criterion, but "Pupils can retell the story in 4-6 sentences using the repeated refrain and sequencing words" should be stated as a success criterion.

**Rating:** Pitfalls are strong and KS1-specific. Missing success criteria and sensitive content guidance.

### 10. Vocabulary

The word mat lists 6 terms: troll, bridge, refrain, character, story, retell. No definitions are provided.

For Y1, these terms need careful handling. "Troll," "bridge," "character," and "story" are words most Y1 children will know. "Refrain" is a new term — most 5-6 year olds will not have encountered it, and it needs explicit definition ("The part of the story that repeats again and again — Trip, trap, trip, trap!"). "Retell" is a school-specific word that children may not use at home.

Missing from the list: **beginning, middle, end** (from the literary terms section), **first, then, next, finally** (the sequencing words from the writing outcome), and **villain/hero** (useful for discussing good versus evil). The vocabulary word mat and the literary terms section list different terms — they should be integrated.

At KS1, a vocabulary display is typically visual — the word is shown with a picture. "Troll" alongside a picture of a troll under a bridge; "refrain" alongside the repeated text in a speech bubble. The planner cannot provide images, but it could specify that visual support is needed.

**Rating:** Adequate term selection for the text, but missing the sequencing vocabulary that the writing outcome depends on. Empty definitions remain a gap.

## What I Could Teach From This Planner (Without External Resources)

1. I could identify the learning focus (narrative sequencing through traditional tales) and explain it to anyone observing.
2. I could set differentiated targets using the entry/developing/expected/greater depth table — and share these with my teaching assistant.
3. I could share the writing outcome with children: "You are going to retell the story of Billy Goats Gruff in 4-6 sentences."
4. I could teach the text type features explicitly: "This story uses the rule of three. Can you spot it?"
5. I could anticipate common errors at each level and prepare targeted support — the "then... then... then..." habit is clearly flagged.
6. I could plan a sequence from this unit to Little Red Riding Hood.
7. I could avoid the three pitfalls, particularly the "too much drama, too little writing" trap.

## What I Would Still Need to Create Myself

1. **A specific edition of the text** — which version of Billy Goats Gruff? The illustrations and language vary enormously. I need a specific recommendation, not "various illustrators."
2. **Story map / story board template** — a visual planning tool showing 4-6 boxes for children to draw and write in sequence. This is the core Y1 planning tool and is not provided.
3. **Comparison texts** — at least one other traditional tale with a similar structure (The Three Little Pigs, Goldilocks) to teach the rule of three as a pattern across stories, not just a feature of this one story.
4. **Oral rehearsal plan** — how to structure the "saying sentences aloud before writing" phase. Do children rehearse with talk partners? Do they use actions? Do they use a story map? The planner names oral rehearsal as a concept but does not scaffold it.
5. **Vocabulary definitions and visual displays** — word mat needs definitions and images. Y1 vocabulary displays must be visual.
6. **Session-by-session breakdown** — 6-8 lessons with clear progression from listening to writing. Which lessons are shared reading? Which are drama? Which are writing?
7. **Modelled writing example** — a teacher-written retelling of 4-6 sentences that demonstrates sequencing words and the refrain. Children need to see what the finished product looks like before they write.
8. **Sentence stems** — "First, the _____ billy goat went over the _____." For lower-attaining Y1 writers, these are essential scaffolds.
9. **Cross-curricular plan** — Drama, Art, DT links. In KS1, the core text drives the whole curriculum for 1-2 weeks.
10. **Thinking lens framing** — "What patterns can you see in this story?" as a question to return to across the unit.

## Comparison to V7

### What has improved:

1. **DifficultyLevel differentiation is the major gain.** In V7, I reviewed a Y3 spelling cluster with zero differentiation data. Now, the primary concept has a full differentiation table with KS1-appropriate example tasks and common errors. The "then... then... then..." error at Developing level is exactly what I see in my classroom. This is transformative for assessment and targeted teaching.
2. **Writing outcome is clear and correctly scoped.** "4-6 sentences using the repeated refrain and sequencing words" is specific, measurable, and achievable for Y1. V7 had no writing outcome at all for the spelling cluster.
3. **Text type features are named and teachable.** Repeated refrain, rule of three, good versus evil, beginning-middle-end — these are the features I teach explicitly in KS1, and having them listed in the planner validates the planning approach.
4. **Pitfalls are KS1-specific and practical.** "Keep to 4-6 sentences" and "don't spend too long on drama" are genuinely useful warnings that show understanding of Y1 teaching.
5. **The move from cluster context to unit planner is the right structural decision.** English teachers plan around texts, not concept clusters. A planner titled "The Three Billy Goats Gruff" makes more sense to me than one titled "EN-KS1-D005-CL002."

### What has regressed:

1. **No thinking lens.** V7 had "Patterns" with question stems. This planner has nothing.
2. **No session structure.** V7 had the 5-phase pedagogy sequence. This planner has no lesson structure.
3. **No cross-curricular section.** V7 had CO_TEACHES relationships. This planner has no cross-curricular links at all — a bigger loss for KS1 than KS2 because KS1 teaching is inherently cross-curricular.
4. **No learner profile data.** Scaffolding levels, interaction types, and feedback guidance are all absent.

### What remains the same:

1. **No model texts or modelled writing examples.**
2. **No vocabulary definitions.**
3. **No assessment rubric or marking criteria.**

### Net assessment:

The V8 planner is a better starting point for planning than V7's cluster context because it is framed around a text (Billy Goats Gruff) rather than a concept cluster (Spelling rules). The differentiation data is the biggest single improvement. But the loss of the pedagogical framework (thinking lens, session structure, learner profile, cross-curricular links) means the planner gives me better WHAT but weaker HOW than V7.

For KS1 specifically, the missing cross-curricular section is more damaging than at KS2. In Y1, Billy Goats Gruff is not just an English unit — it is the whole curriculum for a week or two. Drama, Art, Maths, and PSHE all flow from the core text. A planner that does not acknowledge this misses how Reception and Year 1 teaching actually works.

## Score: 7.5 / 10

**Justification:** Up from 5.5 in V7. The DifficultyLevel differentiation (+1.0), writing outcome (+0.5), text type features (+0.5), and pitfalls (+0.5) represent substantial improvements. Loss of thinking lens, session structure, cross-curricular links, and learner profile (-0.5) partially offsets the gains. The 7.5 reflects that this planner gives me a strong unit overview that I could start planning from, but I would need to create the lesson-by-lesson detail, vocabulary support, modelled writing, and cross-curricular connections myself. It saves me 60-90 minutes of the planning process but does not eliminate the need for teacher-created resources.
