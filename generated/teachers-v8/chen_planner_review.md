## Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. Header and Metadata

The header correctly identifies Science, KS1, Y1/Y2, and marks the study as Mandatory with a 2-lesson estimated duration. The statutory reference is accurate and specific: "Y1 Everyday materials: distinguish between an object and the material from which it is made; identify and name a variety of everyday materials."

**Problems:** The source document field reads "Art and Design (KS1/KS2) - National Curriculum Programme of Study." This is wrong -- a KS1 Science planner should reference the Science NC programme of study. This is a variant of the source document join error visible in the other planners, but here it has pulled an Art and Design document rather than an English GPS document. The generator's source document resolution is clearly broken across multiple subjects.

The 2-lesson estimate feels right for the waterproofing investigation itself, though I would typically embed this within a wider 6-8 lesson materials unit. The planner does not indicate whether it represents a standalone investigation or part of a longer sequence.

### 2. Enquiry Questions

One enquiry question: "Which material is best for keeping teddy dry?"

This is an excellent KS1 Science question. It is child-friendly, purposeful (children care about teddy), testable, and uses the comparative structure ("which is best") that the Y1 curriculum specifies. It invites genuine investigation rather than recall. Of all three planners I have seen described by colleagues, this enquiry question is the most engaging and age-appropriate.

**What I would extend:** I would use this as the culminating investigation and add a preliminary question: "What do we already know about materials?" to structure the observation and identification lessons that should precede the waterproofing test. The planner's concept list (5 concepts including Object vs Material, Material Identification, and Material Properties) implies a sequence that is broader than one waterproofing test, but the enquiry question only covers the testing element.

### 3. Concept Quality and Differentiation

Five concepts are provided -- one primary and four secondary -- which is generous for a KS1 investigation and gives the planner broader utility as a materials unit overview.

**Primary concept (Object vs Material Distinction, SC-KS1-C024):** This is the right foundational concept. The description is clear and accurate: "The conceptual distinction between an object (a made thing with a function) and the material it is made from (the substance of which it consists)." The teaching guidance is immediately usable: "Use a 'what is it made of?' routine when handling objects. Deliberately choose objects made from one obvious material first, then introduce objects made from multiple materials." I could start teaching from this paragraph.

The misconception is spot-on: "Children frequently name an object when asked what it is made of (e.g., saying 'table' when the material is 'wood')." This is the #1 KS1 materials misconception and every teacher encounters it. Having it flagged in the planner means I would address it from lesson one.

The four-tier differentiation table is beautifully calibrated for KS1:
- Entry: "Beginning to distinguish between what an object is and what it is made from, when prompted." The example task ("I am holding a wooden spoon. What is the object? What is it made from?") is perfect for 5-6 year olds -- concrete, uses a familiar object, and structures the two questions clearly.
- Developing: "Consistently distinguishing object from material for several items, beginning to notice that the same object can be made from different materials." Appropriate progression.
- Expected: "Explaining the difference and recognising that a single object can be made from more than one material." The scissors example (multiple materials, functional reason) is a classic KS1 teaching moment.
- Greater Depth: "Explaining that the same material can be used to make many different objects, and the same object can be made from different materials." This is the reversibility of the object-material relationship -- a genuinely deeper understanding for high-attaining KS1 children.

**The common errors are age-specific and realistic.** "Saying 'glass' is the object rather than the material" (Developing level) is exactly what Y1 children say. "Thinking each material can only be used for one purpose" (Greater Depth) targets a genuine conceptual limitation. These are not generic errors -- they are KS1-specific.

**Secondary concepts:** Close Observation, Simple Testing, Material Identification, and Material Properties are all included with descriptions and differentiation tables. Each is relevant to the waterproofing investigation and together they cover the full range of Y1 Everyday Materials objectives.

The Simple Testing differentiation is particularly useful. The Developing level describes the exact fair testing error children make: "Using different numbers of drops on each material without realising it makes the test unfair." This maps directly to the planner's pitfall about standardising water amounts.

Material Properties (SC-KS1-C026) includes the full paired descriptor set from the NC: hard/soft, stretchy/stiff, shiny/dull, rough/smooth, bendy/not bendy, waterproof/not waterproof, absorbent/not absorbent, opaque/transparent. Having these listed explicitly in the concept description ensures I cover all the required vocabulary.

### 4. Subject-Specific Content

**Variables:** The variables section is appropriately simplified for KS1:
- Independent: type of material
- Dependent: amount of water passing through
- Controlled: amount of water, size of material

At KS1, I would not use the terms "independent" and "dependent" with children, but having them stated for the teacher is useful for planning the fair test structure. The controlled variables (amount of water, size of material) are the two key things children need to keep the same, and both are manageable for Y1/2 children to control with support.

**Equipment and safety:** The equipment list is practical and child-safe: material samples (fabric, plastic bag, foil, paper, card, cling film), small teddy bear or toy, water spray bottle or watering can, measuring spoon, paper towels. The material selection is good -- it includes materials that are clearly waterproof (plastic bag, cling film), clearly not waterproof (paper, card), and in between (foil, fabric) which creates genuine investigation interest.

Safety notes are sensible: "Mop up water spills promptly", "Ensure glass samples are not used for the waterproof test", "Supervise water pouring to avoid flooding the table." The note about glass is important -- Y1 children should not be handling wet glass samples. The hazard level (low) is correct.

**Expected outcome:** "Children discover that different materials have different properties (waterproof, absorbent, flexible, strong) that make them suitable for different purposes. Plastic and foil keep teddy dry because they are waterproof; paper and fabric let water through because they are absorbent." Clear, correct, and connects properties to suitability -- which is the KS1 curriculum emphasis.

**Recording format:** "Simple tables, verbal descriptions." Appropriate for KS1. I would add drawing as a recording method -- many Y1 children will record more effectively through labelled drawings than written descriptions.

**Enquiry type:** Fair Test, same definition as the Y5 planner. The definition is accurate but written at a teacher level, not a child level. For KS1, I would reframe this as: "We are going to find out which material is best by testing them all the same way." The planner does not adjust its language for the age group.

### 5. Thinking Lenses

No thinking lenses section. In V7, I found the "Cause and Effect" and "Patterns" lenses directly usable for KS2 Science -- the question stems gave me ready-made discussion prompts. For KS1, a "Patterns" lens would be appropriate: "Which materials let water through? Which kept teddy dry? What pattern do you notice?" The data exists in the graph (ThinkingLens nodes with KS1 PROMPT_FOR relationships) but is not surfaced.

### 6. Session Structure / Vehicle Templates

No session structure or vehicle template. The planner says "2 lessons" but provides no breakdown. A natural structure would be:
- Lesson 1: Explore materials, sort by properties, predict which will keep teddy dry
- Lesson 2: Test materials, record results, draw conclusion

This structure falls naturally from the concept list (Material Identification and Properties in Lesson 1, Simple Testing and the waterproofing investigation in Lesson 2), but the planner does not make it explicit.

### 7. Cross-Curricular Opportunities

One link: "Moving Pictures (Sliders and Levers)" in DT -- "Choosing suitable materials for a making task based on their properties" (Strong).

This is a valid and useful connection. KS1 DT involves selecting materials for making projects, and understanding material properties directly supports design choices ("I need a stiff material for the slider mechanism, not a bendy one").

**What is missing:** This is thin for a KS1 materials unit. Obvious cross-curricular links that are absent:
- **English:** Non-fiction writing ("The best material for keeping teddy dry is... because..."), which practises causal connectives at KS1 level. Also links to "The Three Little Pigs" (material suitability is the entire plot).
- **Maths:** Sorting and classifying (a core KS1 maths skill directly practised in material sorting activities).
- **Art:** Collage using different materials, exploring texture (which connects to rough/smooth property descriptors).

The planner provides only one cross-curricular link where a KS1 teacher would expect 3-4. The Subject column again shows "None" rather than "DT".

### 8. Sequencing

No sequencing section (follows/leads-to). For KS1 Science, this investigation should follow introductory lessons on naming and identifying materials, and could lead to seasonal changes observation or plant growth (where material properties of natural materials become relevant).

More importantly, the planner does not indicate how it connects to KS2. The Material Properties concept (SC-KS1-C026) is flagged in the V7 review as a prerequisite for the KS2 Light domain (children need to know about opaque/transparent before studying shadows). This KS1-to-KS2 progression would be valuable information for a KS1 teacher to know -- "what you teach now lays the foundation for Y3 Light and Shadows."

### 9. Pitfalls, Sensitive Content, Success Criteria

**Pitfalls** (3 items) are practical and KS1-specific:
1. "Children pour different amounts of water on each material, making comparison unfair -- agree a standard amount before starting." This is the #1 fair testing error at KS1 and the solution (agree a standard amount) is actionable.
2. "Pupils focus only on waterproofness and miss other material properties -- discuss why plastic bags are waterproof but not strong enough for some purposes." This pushes children beyond the investigation to think about suitability, which is the curriculum aim.
3. "Recording is verbal only and not captured -- provide a simple table with material names pre-printed so children tick or draw results." Practical advice that accounts for KS1 recording limitations.

All three pitfalls are informed by classroom experience and immediately useful. The third one (pre-printed table) is the kind of practical suggestion that saves a lesson from producing no written evidence.

**No sensitive content section.** Appropriate for a materials investigation.

**No explicit success criteria.** The differentiation tables provide assessment descriptors, but there are no child-friendly "I can..." statements suitable for KS1 self-assessment or display.

### 10. Vocabulary

Eight terms are listed (material, waterproof, absorbent, strong, flexible, suitable, test, compare) but all definitions are empty. The same rendering issue as every planner.

The term selection is good for KS1 -- it covers both property vocabulary (waterproof, absorbent, strong, flexible) and scientific process vocabulary (test, compare, suitable). For Y1, I would add: object, made from, hard, soft, rough, smooth -- the paired descriptors from the Material Properties concept that are essential for observation activities.

## What I Could Teach From This Planner (Without External Resources)

- The waterproofing investigation: enquiry question, materials, equipment, method (implicit from variables), expected outcome
- Material identification and naming: 12 NC-specified materials listed in the Material Identification concept
- Property paired descriptors: hard/soft, stretchy/stiff, etc. from the Material Properties concept
- Object vs material distinction: teaching routine ("What is it? What is it made from?") and common misconception
- Fair testing at KS1: what to keep the same, what to change, how to record
- Differentiated assessment: four tiers per concept with specific success descriptors and common errors
- Pitfall avoidance: pre-agreed water amounts, pre-printed recording table

## What I Would Still Need to Create Myself

- A lesson-by-lesson structure for the wider materials unit (not just the waterproofing test)
- Vocabulary definitions for the word mat
- An initial sorting activity: bags of mixed materials for children to name, handle, and sort by properties
- A prediction sheet: "Which material do you think will keep teddy dry? Draw a circle around it."
- A pre-printed results table for the investigation (material names down the side, "dry/wet" or smiley/sad face recording)
- Cross-curricular links to English (Three Little Pigs), Maths (sorting), and Art (collage)
- A display-ready "I can..." success criteria list at KS1 level
- Extension activities for Greater Depth children (e.g., "Can you make paper waterproof by covering it in wax?")
- A class discussion prompt linking to KS2 progression ("In Year 3, you will use what you know about materials to study light and shadows")
- Photographs of the materials for interactive whiteboard display

**Note on score comparability:** V7 reviewed a KS2 cluster (Light & Shadows for Y3); V8 reviews a KS1 planner (Materials for Y1/2). The improved score reflects both the format improvements (variables, equipment, differentiation) and the fact that the KS1 materials data is particularly well-crafted -- the concept descriptions, misconceptions, and differentiation tables are among the best I have seen in this system. The KS1 Science data appears to have been authored by someone who understands early years Science pedagogy.
