## Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. Header and Metadata

The header correctly identifies History, KS2, Y3/Y4, and marks the study as Mandatory with a 12-lesson estimated duration. The statutory reference to the NC programme of study ("The Roman Empire and its impact on Britain") is accurate and directly quotable for medium-term planning documentation.

**Problems:** The source document field reads "KS2 English Grammar, Punctuation and Spelling Test Framework 2016" -- this is plainly wrong. A History planner should reference the History NC programme of study, not an English GPS test framework. This looks like a data join error in the auto-generator: the source document field is being pulled from the wrong layer. It is not a minor cosmetic issue -- if I submitted this planner to my head of department with that reference, it would undermine credibility.

The study type ("Period Study") is correct and helpful. Knowing the study type tells me immediately that this is a chronologically bounded investigation rather than a thematic or local study.

### 2. Enquiry Questions

Three enquiry questions are provided:

1. "Why did the Romans invade Britain, and what were the consequences?"
2. "What can the Vindolanda tablets tell us about everyday life in Roman Britain?"
3. "How significant was the Roman legacy in modern Britain?"

These are genuinely good. Each one maps to a different disciplinary concept (Cause and Consequence, Evidence and Interpretation, Significance) which gives the study clear intellectual structure. The Vindolanda question is the strongest -- it invites source analysis, not just narrative recall. The significance question provides a strong summative endpoint.

**What I would change:** Question 1 is two questions fused into one, which makes it harder for Y3/4 children to hold in mind. I would split it: "Why did the Romans come to Britain?" and "What changed when the Romans arrived?" This is a pedagogical judgement rather than a data gap -- the planner provides the raw material; a teacher would naturally adapt.

I would also add a question about Boudicca specifically, since she appears in the key figures and events section but has no enquiry question driving her inclusion. Something like: "Was Boudicca a hero, a villain, or something more complicated?"

### 3. Concept Quality and Differentiation

This is where the planner has improved most dramatically since V7.

The primary concept (HI-KS2-C005: British Historical Periods) has a full description, teaching guidance, key vocabulary, and common misconceptions. The teaching guidance is practical: "use a timeline that runs from prehistoric times to 1066", "connect to local history: are there local Roman roads, Anglo-Saxon place names?" These are suggestions I could act on.

Three secondary concepts (Cause and Consequence, Significance, Historical Evidence and Interpretation) are each presented with descriptions and differentiation tables. This is transformative compared to V7. In my V7 review, I flagged that History concepts had no DifficultyLevels and I had to invent all differentiation tiers myself. Now every concept has a four-tier table (Entry, Developing, Expected, Greater Depth) with specific success descriptors and common errors.

**The differentiation tables are well-calibrated for KS2 History.** For example, the Cause and Consequence table progresses from "identifying a single cause or consequence when given options" (Entry) to "evaluating the relative importance of different causes, arguing which was most significant and supporting the argument with evidence" (Greater Depth). That progression is pedagogically sound and aligns with how I teach historical reasoning.

**Gaps in the differentiation tables:**
- The primary concept table has both "Example task" and "Common errors" columns, but the secondary concept tables have "Common errors" but no "Example task" column. This inconsistency means I have differentiated tasks for the broad chronological concept but not for Cause and Consequence, Significance, or Evidence -- which are the disciplinary concepts I actually need to assess. The differentiation descriptors are useful but I would still need to create specific assessment tasks for each tier.
- The common errors are thoughtful. "Treating causes as a simple list rather than explaining how they interact" (Cause and Consequence, Expected level) is a real pattern I see in Y4 writing. "Accepting period labels uncritically without questioning who created them and why" (Greater Depth) is an ambitious but appropriate stretch for high-attaining KS2 pupils.

### 4. Subject-Specific Content

**Primary sources:** This section is the single biggest improvement over V7 and the reason my score has risen. Three historically grounded source types are provided: Hadrian's Wall (built heritage), Roman coins (archaeological), and Vindolanda tablets (primary written). Each has a description, pedagogical guidance ("How to use"), a physical location, and a URL.

The Vindolanda tablets section is particularly well done. The guidance says: "Read a simplified Vindolanda tablet (e.g. the birthday invitation from Claudia Severa, or the request for warm socks). Ask: 'What does this tell us about daily life for a Roman soldier?'" This names specific tablets, suggests specific questions, and pitches correctly for KS2. I could walk into a lesson and use this framing immediately.

The Roman coins section is practical: "Show a Roman coin with an emperor's portrait. Ask: 'What can this coin tell us about who was in charge?'" followed by "Coins are accessible primary sources for KS2: they are small, concrete objects with readable images." That final note shows genuine pedagogical awareness.

**However:** Each source entry has an empty field after its type label (line 93 reads "Built Heritage, " with a trailing comma and empty space -- same pattern for all three). This looks like a rendering bug where an additional property (perhaps a date range or provenance field) was expected but is null.

**What is still missing:** The sources are described but not provided. I still need to find or create: a simplified transcript of the Claudia Severa tablet, a high-resolution coin image suitable for projection, and a labelled photograph of Hadrian's Wall. The planner tells me what to look for and where to look, but does not give me the artefact itself. This was my main complaint in V7 and it remains partly unresolved. The difference is that V7 had source names only; V8 gives me descriptions, pedagogical framing, and URLs. The gap has narrowed considerably.

**Disciplinary concepts:** The table mapping four disciplinary concepts (Cause and Consequence, Significance, Evidence and Interpretation, Change and Continuity) to their key questions and roles in this study is excellent. Each entry explains what the concept means specifically in the context of Roman Britain at KS2 level. "At KS2, identify multiple causes of the Roman invasion (trade, resources, prestige, military ambition) and rank them" is actionable teaching guidance, not abstract theory.

**Key figures and events:** Boudicca, Julius Caesar, Claudius, and Hadrian are listed with four key events and their dates. The period (43 AD - 410 AD) is stated. This is accurate and useful for timeline construction.

**Perspectives:** "Roman coloniser, Briton, Roman soldier, enslaved person" -- I appreciate the inclusion of the enslaved person perspective. This was absent from every commercial scheme of work I used prior to 2023. The planner also includes historiographical debate about whether Romanisation was imposed or adopted, which supports genuine historical enquiry rather than a single narrative.

**One omission that matters to me:** There is no mention of the perspective of the Caledonians or Picts -- the peoples north of Hadrian's Wall who the Romans failed to conquer. This is a missed opportunity for discussing the limits of Roman power, which connects directly to enquiry question 1.

### 5. Thinking Lenses

No thinking lenses appear in this planner. In V7, the cluster review included "Cause and Effect" as the primary lens with age-banded question stems and agent prompts that I found directly usable. The planner format appears to have dropped this section entirely.

This is a regression. The thinking lenses were one of the consensus strengths from V7 (rated useful by 8/9 teachers). The disciplinary concepts table partially compensates -- it essentially provides the same "key question" framing that thinking lenses offered -- but the age-banded prompts and question stems that made the lenses immediately classroom-ready are gone.

### 6. Session Structure / Vehicle Templates

No vehicle template or session structure section appears. The planner provides a 12-lesson estimate but no guidance on how those 12 lessons might be structured. There is no suggested lesson breakdown (e.g., "Lesson 1: Introduction and timeline; Lessons 2-3: Causes of invasion; Lessons 4-5: Source work...").

In my V7 review, I had the Y4 pedagogy profile (productive failure sequence, scaffolding guidance) which at least gave me a structural skeleton. Here, I would need to design the 12-lesson sequence entirely from scratch using the concepts and sources as raw material.

### 7. Cross-Curricular Opportunities

Three links are provided:

1. UK Regional Study (Geography) -- "Roman roads and settlement patterns" (Moderate)
2. Spelling and Vocabulary (English) -- "Diary writing as a Roman soldier or Boudicca; Latin roots in English vocabulary" (Strong)
3. Bridges: Beam, Arch and Truss (DT) -- "Roman building techniques: arches, aqueducts, mosaics" (Strong)

The English link is the strongest and most immediately actionable -- diary writing in role is a standard KS2 cross-curricular activity that connects naturally. The DT link is creative and genuinely useful; making Roman arches from card is a classic KS2 DT project.

**Problem:** The "Subject" column reads "None" for all three entries. This looks like a rendering or data issue -- the cross-curricular links clearly involve Geography, English, and DT respectively, but the subject field is not populated.

### 8. Sequencing

"Follows: Stone Age to Iron Age Britain" and "Leads to: Anglo-Saxon and Scots Settlement." This is correct and matches standard KS2 History sequencing. In V7, I had to assume this sequence myself because the graph had no explicit teaching order between content vehicles. Now it is stated directly. Simple, correct, useful.

### 9. Pitfalls, Sensitive Content, Success Criteria

**Pitfalls** (3 items) are well-chosen:
- "Presenting the Romans as unambiguously civilising rather than examining the violence and exploitation of conquest" -- this is the most common mistake in KS2 Roman Britain teaching and I am glad it is flagged.
- "Neglecting the perspective of the indigenous Britons" -- yes, exactly.
- "Reducing Boudicca to a simple hero narrative without examining the complexity of her revolt" -- good, though this would benefit from more specific guidance about how to handle it with 8-9 year olds.

**Sensitive content** correctly identifies slavery and conquest violence. The guidance ("discuss with appropriate sensitivity", "present balanced perspectives") is generic but adequate. I would want more specific framing -- for instance, that discussing Roman slavery should acknowledge its scale without graphic detail, and that children may make connections to modern slavery or colonialism that need careful handling.

**No explicit success criteria section.** The differentiation tables serve a similar function, but there are no "I can..." statements or assessment checklist.

### 10. Vocabulary

Nine terms are listed (centurion, legion, Romanisation, villa, amphitheatre, mosaic, aqueduct, revolt, empire) but every definition field is empty. This is a significant rendering issue. The concept descriptions include a key_vocabulary field with 16 terms and the vocabulary is clearly stored in the graph, but the word mat table has not been populated with definitions.

A vocabulary word mat with blank definitions is worse than no word mat at all -- it looks like a planning document that was started but not finished.

## What I Could Teach From This Planner (Without External Resources)

- The chronological framework: key dates, periods, sequencing
- Disciplinary enquiry structure: three well-formed enquiry questions mapped to four disciplinary concepts
- Differentiated learning expectations at four tiers for each concept
- Source-based teaching using Vindolanda tablets and Roman coins (with the caveat that I need to source the actual images/transcripts)
- Key figures and events narrative
- Balanced perspective including colonised peoples and enslaved persons
- Cross-curricular connections to English (diary writing, Latin roots) and DT (Roman arches)

## What I Would Still Need to Create Myself

- Actual source materials: simplified tablet transcripts, coin images for projection, Hadrian's Wall photographs
- A 12-lesson sequence plan breaking the study into structured sessions
- "I can..." success criteria at each differentiation level
- Vocabulary definitions for the word mat
- Activity descriptions for each lesson (card sorts, living timelines, hot-seating, freeze frames)
- Writing frames for historical argument and source analysis
- Assessment tasks for each tier
- A Boudicca-focused enquiry or lesson
- Guidance on how to handle the "Romanisation" debate with 8-9 year olds

## Comparison to V7

| Aspect | V7 (Cluster Review) | V8 (Planner Review) | Change |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|--------|
| Concept descriptions | Present, useful | Present, equally useful | Same |
| Differentiation | Not available for History | Four-tier tables for all 4 concepts | Major improvement |
| Primary sources | Names + URLs only | Descriptions + pedagogical guidance + URLs | Major improvement |
| Disciplinary concepts | Via ThinkingLens only | Dedicated table with role-in-study | Improvement |
| Thinking lenses | Present with age-banded prompts | Missing | Regression |
| Lesson structure | Pedagogy profile gave skeleton | No structure provided | Regression |
| Cross-curricular | Not available | 3 links (subject field empty) | New addition |
| Vocabulary | Terms + definitions from concept | Terms listed, definitions empty | Regression |
| Sequencing | Not explicit | Explicit follows/leads-to | New addition |
| Pitfalls & sensitivity | Not available | 3 pitfalls + 2 sensitivity notes | New addition |
| Learner profile | Full Y4 profile available | Not included | Missing |
| Overall score | 5.5/10 | **7.5/10** | **+2.0** |

The planner format has made substantial gains in subject-specific content (sources, disciplinary concepts, perspectives, sensitivity) while losing some structural elements from the cluster format (thinking lenses, pedagogy profiles, lesson skeleton). The net result is a significantly more usable document for a History specialist.

## Score: 7.5 / 10
