## Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. Header and Metadata

The header identifies the subject (Design and Technology), key stage (KS2), and year group (Y5, Y6). The estimated duration is 6 lessons, which is realistic for a structures unit involving design, make, and evaluate phases.

The same source document error that appears in the Art planner is here: "KS2 English Grammar, Punctuation and Spelling Test Framework 2016." This is incorrect -- the source should be the DT Programme of Study from the National Curriculum 2014. I flagged this same class of error in Brennan's Art review. It appears to be a systematic bug in the auto-generator, not a one-off.

The statutory reference ("apply their understanding of how to strengthen, stiffen and reinforce more complex structures") is accurate and specific. I can trace this directly to the DT programme of study. Good.

No study type is listed. The Art planner has "Artist Study" and the Geography planner has "Case Study." For DT, this should be something like "Structures: Design-Make-Evaluate" to classify the type of learning.

No status field. The Geography planner shows "Exemplar" and the Art planner shows "Convention." This field's absence here is inconsistent.

### 2. Enquiry Questions

No enquiry questions. For a bridge-building unit, a driving question adds genuine value: "Which bridge design can hold the most weight -- and why?" or "How do engineers choose between beam, arch, and truss designs?" A clear question gives children a reason to investigate structural principles rather than just following making instructions.

The design brief in the DT-specific section partially serves this function ("Design and build a bridge to span a 30cm gap... must justify your choice"), but it is buried in the middle of the planner rather than positioned as the framing question.

### 3. Concept Quality and Differentiation

Three concepts are provided: Accurate Making and Material Processing (primary), Technical Drawing and Design Communication (secondary), and History and Influence of Design and Technology (secondary).

The primary concept (DT-KS2-C006, Accurate Making) is well-described. The teaching guidance is practical: "Teach measuring and marking out as essential precursors to cutting: measure twice, cut once." The concept of tolerance ("how close to the intended dimension does a measurement need to be?") is a sophisticated idea that connects DT to mathematics. I appreciated this -- it is exactly the kind of cross-curricular thinking I want in a DT lesson.

The differentiation tables are present for all three concepts, with Entry/Developing/Expected levels. The Accurate Making differentiation is strong:
- Entry: "Measuring and cutting materials to a marked line with reasonable accuracy" with example task "Measure and cut a piece of card that is 20cm long."
- Expected: "Working with precision across the full making process, selecting appropriate tools and techniques" with example task "Make a box with a lid that fits snugly."

The common errors are practical and specific: "Not measuring from the zero mark on the ruler" (Entry) and "Not planning for tolerance -- making the lid exactly the same size as the box so it doesn't fit" (Expected). These are real errors that happen in real DT lessons. They are immediately usable for formative assessment.

However, Technical Drawing and History differentiation tables lack example tasks -- they only have "what success looks like" and "common errors." The History concept's Expected level ("Explaining how a design innovation reflects its historical and cultural context") is pitched appropriately for upper KS2 but would benefit from a Lowry-equivalent note connecting to Brunel, Telford, or other bridge engineers specifically referenced in the cross-curricular section.

### 4. Subject-Specific Content

This is the strongest section. The DT: Structures box provides:

**Design brief:** "Design and build a bridge to span a 30cm gap between two tables. The bridge must hold the maximum possible weight. You may choose beam, arch, or truss design -- but must justify your choice."

This is a well-constructed brief. The 30cm span is achievable with classroom materials. The weight-bearing test provides a measurable outcome. The choice of three design types forces children to understand the structural principles before making. The justification requirement connects to the Technical Drawing concept.

**Materials:** card strips, wooden lollipop sticks, straws, string, tape, PVA glue. A realistic and affordable materials list for a primary school. Every item is available from standard school suppliers or can be sourced cheaply. This is immediately useful.

**Tools:** scissors, ruler, glue gun (adult supervised), weights for testing. Appropriate for Y5-Y6.

**Techniques:** triangulation, laminating for strength, arch construction, joint reinforcement, load testing. These are the correct structural engineering techniques for this unit. "Triangulation" is the key concept -- triangular structures are inherently rigid because triangles cannot deform without changing the length of a side. This should be explicitly taught.

**Safety notes:** "Glue gun: adult supervision only. Ensure testing weights are added gradually and controlled -- do not drop weights onto bridges. Test area should be clear of pupils in case of sudden structural failure." This is practical and appropriate. The note about clearing the test area shows awareness of real classroom safety issues.

**Evaluation criteria:** Four clear criteria that align with the learning objectives. "Is the design choice (beam/arch/truss) justified?" is the most important -- it elevates this from a craft activity to an engineering activity.

What is missing: there is no explanation of the three bridge types. A teacher who is not confident with structures would not know the difference between a beam, arch, and truss bridge from this planner alone. A brief description of each -- "A beam bridge is the simplest form: a flat deck resting on two supports. An arch bridge transfers the load sideways into the abutments. A truss bridge uses triangulated frameworks to distribute forces across the structure" -- would be essential for a non-specialist.

### 5. Thinking Lenses

No thinking lenses. For structures, "Structure and Function" is the obvious choice: "How does the shape of the bridge help it carry weight? What happens to the forces when we change the shape?" The graph has this lens with age-banded KS2 prompts. Its absence here is the same ontology-to-lens gap I noted in the Art review.

"Cause and Effect" would also apply: "What causes the bridge to fail? What is the relationship between joint quality and load-bearing capacity?"

### 6. Session Structure / Vehicle Templates

No session structure or lesson-by-lesson plan. For a 6-lesson DT unit, the standard structure is well established:

1. Investigate existing products (research bridge types, test simple structures)
2. Design (draw annotated designs, justify material and technique choices)
3. Make -- session 1 (build the main structure)
4. Make -- session 2 (reinforce, test, iterate)
5. Evaluate (load test, record results, compare designs)
6. Evaluate and communicate (present findings, connect to real-world engineering)

The graph has VehicleTemplate nodes. A DT structures template should exist that provides this investigate-design-make-evaluate cycle. Without it, the planner provides materials and a brief but no pedagogical sequence.

This matters more for DT than for Art because DT has a defined process cycle (investigate, design, make, evaluate) that is part of the statutory curriculum. A planner that does not structure around this cycle is missing the fundamental pedagogical framework of the subject.

### 7. Cross-Curricular Opportunities

Two links are provided:
- British History Beyond 1066: "Famous bridges and their engineers: Brunel, Telford" (Moderate)
- Friction Investigation: "Forces, compression, tension" (Moderate)

Both are valid and well-chosen. The Brunel/Telford link connects directly to the History of D&T concept in the planner. The forces link connects to Science -- compression and tension are the two fundamental forces in bridge structures.

However, the most important cross-curricular link is to Mathematics, and it is missing. Bridge building is inherently mathematical:
- Measuring and cutting to specific lengths (MA-Y5: measure, compare, add and subtract lengths)
- Calculating load per unit area (informal ratio and proportion)
- Recording and comparing test results using tables and bar charts (MA-Y5: statistics)
- Scaling -- if a model bridge at 1/10 scale holds X weight, what would the full-size bridge hold? (MA-Y5: multiplication and division)

The absence of a Maths cross-curricular link is a significant gap for a Y5 DT structures unit. As a Maths specialist teaching DT, this is the connection I would most want to make explicit.

Both cross-curricular entries show "Subject: None" -- the same rendering bug noted in the Art planner review.

### 8. Sequencing

No sequencing information. I would expect to see where this unit sits in the Y5-Y6 DT curriculum. Does it follow a mechanisms unit? Precede a textiles unit? In the broader DT progression, where does "apply understanding of how to strengthen, stiffen and reinforce" sit relative to simpler structural work at KS1 (building towers from construction kits) and lower KS2 (simple frameworks)?

### 9. Pitfalls, Sensitive Content, Success Criteria

**Pitfalls:** Three good entries:
1. "All pupils build the same design -- set it as a competition with different constraints for each team." This is excellent advice. If every group builds a truss bridge, the comparison becomes meaningless. Assigning different bridge types to different groups creates genuine comparison.
2. "Joints as the failure point, not the structure -- teach that joints must be as strong as members." This is the most important structural engineering principle in the unit. Most classroom bridges fail at the joints, not because the structure is wrong. This pitfall effectively teaches the teacher the key content.
3. "Not testing incrementally -- add weight gradually to observe how the structure responds." Good testing methodology advice.

**Sensitive content:** None listed. DT structures is unlikely to raise sensitivity issues, so the absence is acceptable here.

**Success criteria:** None listed. For a structures unit, clear success criteria are essential because the product is testable:
- Does the bridge span 30cm?
- How much weight does it hold before failure?
- Can the pupil explain why they chose beam/arch/truss?
- Are the joints well-constructed and reinforced?

The evaluation criteria in the DT section partially serve this function, but they are not formatted as pupil-facing success criteria.

### 10. Vocabulary

The vocabulary word mat lists 10 terms: beam, arch, truss, span, load, compression, tension, reinforce, brace, triangulation. These are well-chosen and cover the essential structural engineering vocabulary for KS2.

As with the Art planner, all definitions are empty. "Compression" and "tension" are terms that many primary teachers would not be able to define correctly. "Triangulation" is a specialist engineering term that is meaningless without a definition. The vocabulary section is unusable as provided.

The vocabulary list is actually stronger than the Art planner's -- 10 terms versus 8, and the terms are more tightly focused on the specific content of the unit. If definitions were populated, this would be a genuinely useful classroom resource.

## What I Could Teach From This Planner (Without External Resources)

1. I could set the design brief confidently. The 30cm span, weight-bearing test, and three design choices are clearly specified. I know what the children are making and how they will test it.

2. I could source materials. The materials list is realistic and specific -- I would know exactly what to order or gather.

3. I could assess making skills using the Accurate Making differentiation table. The Entry/Developing/Expected descriptions and common errors give me clear formative assessment criteria.

4. I could manage safety. The glue gun and testing safety notes are practical and specific.

5. I could run a fair test. The evaluation criteria and the pitfall about incremental weight loading give me a clear assessment methodology.

6. I could connect to History. The Brunel/Telford reference and the History of D&T concept give me enough content for a context lesson.

## What I Would Still Need to Create Myself

1. **Explanation of beam, arch, and truss structures.** The planner assumes I know the difference. Many primary teachers do not. I would need to research the structural principles and create a teaching resource explaining how each type works and why.

2. **A 6-lesson plan.** No lesson sequence exists. I would need to design the investigate-design-make-evaluate cycle myself.

3. **Maths connections.** Measurement, data recording, and informal ratio/proportion are natural links but not identified. I would need to plan these explicitly.

4. **Vocabulary definitions.** All 10 definitions are empty. I would need to write child-friendly definitions for terms like "triangulation," "compression," and "tension."

5. **Technique demonstrations.** How to triangulate a card structure, how to laminate for strength, how to construct an arch from card -- these practical instructions are not provided. For a non-specialist, this is the hardest gap to fill because you need to have built a bridge yourself to demonstrate effectively.

6. **Success criteria and a marking/assessment approach.** The evaluation criteria exist but are not formatted as pupil-facing success criteria or teacher assessment grids.

## Comparison to V7

In V7, I reviewed a Y5 Maths cluster (Prime Numbers, Factors, Squares and Cubes) and scored it 6.0/10. The primary issue was missing DifficultyLevel data -- I had to invent all differentiation, practice questions, and difficulty grading from professional experience.

This DT planner scores 6.5/10, slightly higher than my V7 Maths score. The reason is the DT-specific section: the design brief, materials list, tools, techniques, safety notes, and evaluation criteria are directly useful in a way that the V7 Maths planner's pedagogy data was not. The Maths planner gave me pedagogical principles (interleaving, productive failure, faded worked examples) but no content. The DT planner gives me concrete content (build a bridge from these materials to this specification) but limited pedagogical structure.

The DT planner is more immediately actionable than the V7 Maths planner because the subject-specific content (design brief, materials, safety) is the kind of information a primary generalist most needs for DT. For Maths, the equivalent would be worked examples and graduated practice questions -- which were absent from V7.

The DT planner's differentiation data is also stronger than I expected. The Accurate Making concept has full Entry/Developing/Expected differentiation with example tasks and common errors. This is comparable to the DifficultyLevel data that transformed Brennan's V7 Maths review. It does not cover all three concepts equally, but the primary concept is well-served.

Where V7 Maths was stronger: thinking lenses, cross-domain links, pedagogy profile integration, interaction types. None of these appear in the DT planner. The pedagogical infrastructure that made the Maths planners powerful has not been connected to the per-subject ontology.

## Score: 6.5 / 10

A functional planner for the making portion of a DT structures unit, with good differentiation on the primary concept, practical materials/safety information, and strong pitfalls. Falls short on lesson structure, vocabulary definitions, structural engineering explanations, Maths cross-curricular links, and the pedagogical framing (thinking lenses, enquiry questions) that would elevate it from a making guide to a teaching plan.
