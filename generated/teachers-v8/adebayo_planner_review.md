## Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. Header and Metadata

The header correctly identifies the subject (Geography), key stage (KS4), year group (Y10, Y11), and estimated duration (10 lessons). The statutory reference is accurate: "DfE GCSE Geography subject content 2014: 'physical geography processes including tectonic hazards'."

One error: the source document is listed as "Citizenship (KS3/KS4) - National Curriculum Programme of Study." This is wrong -- the source should be the DfE GCSE Geography subject content (2014) or a specific exam board specification (AQA, Edexcel, OCR). The same class of source document bug appears across all three planners I am aware of (Art, DT, Geography). It needs systematic fixing.

The study type is "Case Study" and status is "Exemplar" -- both appropriate. The scale is "Global" and the themes list (plate tectonics, earthquake management, volcanic hazards, vulnerability, resilience) is comprehensive.

The assessment guidance in the study scope section is strong: "Can pupils explain plate boundary processes and why hazards occur at specific locations? Can they compare the impacts of a tectonic event in an HIC and a LIC/NEE using named case studies? Can they evaluate management strategies for tectonic hazards?" These three questions map directly to the three levels of GCSE exam demand: describe processes (AO1), apply understanding to named examples (AO2), evaluate and make judgements (AO3). This is useful for a teacher planning assessment.

### 2. Enquiry Questions

One enquiry question is provided: "Can we ever be truly prepared for tectonic hazards?"

This is a good GCSE-level enquiry question. It is evaluative (requires balanced argument), geographical (deals with physical processes and human responses), and debatable (there is no single correct answer). It maps to the 9-mark "evaluate" or "assess" questions that appear on every GCSE Geography paper.

For a 10-lesson sequence, I would expect 2-3 sub-questions that structure the enquiry:
1. Why do tectonic hazards occur? (process knowledge -- Lessons 1-3)
2. Why do the same events have different impacts in different places? (differential impact -- Lessons 4-6)
3. Can monitoring, prediction, and preparation reduce the risk? (management evaluation -- Lessons 7-10)

The overarching question is good but insufficient on its own to structure a 10-lesson scheme. However, this is a minor issue -- I can derive the sub-questions from the concept descriptions.

### 3. Concept Quality and Differentiation

This is the strongest section of the planner and a significant step up from my V7 KS2 experience.

Five concepts are provided: Tectonic Hazards (primary), Climate Change, The Development Gap, Cartographic and Map Skills, and Geographical Statistical Skills (all secondary).

**Primary concept (GE-KS4-C001, Tectonic Hazards):** The description is detailed, accurate, and exam-relevant. It covers plate boundary processes, global distribution, differential impacts, and management strategies -- the four pillars of any GCSE tectonic hazards unit. The teaching guidance is excellent: "Structure teaching using the hazard management cycle: prevention, preparation, response, and recovery." This is exactly how exam boards structure their mark schemes.

The critical sentence in the teaching guidance is: "The key analytical skill at GCSE is explaining differential impacts: why does the same magnitude earthquake kill more people in a low-income country than in a high-income country?" This is the highest-value exam skill for this topic and the planner correctly identifies it as the teaching priority.

**Differentiation:** The four-level differentiation (Emerging/Developing/Secure/Mastery) uses the correct secondary assessment labels, not the primary ones (Entry/Developing/Expected/Greater Depth). This is a good data quality signal -- the system knows it is generating for KS4 and has switched terminology accordingly.

The differentiation is genuinely well-calibrated to GCSE demand:
- Emerging: "Can identify that earthquakes and volcanoes are natural hazards and that they occur at plate boundaries, but cannot explain the processes."
- Developing: "Can explain the processes at each plate boundary type, describe the effects of a tectonic event using a named example, and identify factors that affect the severity of impacts."
- Secure: "Can construct detailed analytical responses comparing tectonic events in contrasting development contexts, evaluating the effectiveness of management strategies using specific evidence."
- Mastery: "Can evaluate the concept of hazard vulnerability critically, analyse the interaction between physical processes and human factors in determining outcomes."

The Developing level maps to GCSE Grade 4-5 (standard pass), Secure maps to Grade 6-7, and Mastery maps to Grade 8-9. The example tasks are well-pitched:
- Developing: "Explain why the Haiti earthquake (2010, magnitude 7.0) caused more deaths than the Japan earthquake (2011, magnitude 9.0). (4 marks)" -- This is a genuine GCSE-style question with the correct mark allocation.
- Secure: "Assess the effectiveness of prediction, protection and preparation as strategies for managing tectonic hazards. Use named examples. (9 marks)" -- This is a 9-mark evaluate question, the highest-demand question type on the GCSE paper.

The common errors at each level are specific and exam-relevant: "Attributing the difference in deaths solely to the magnitude of the earthquake" (Developing) and "Describing management strategies without evaluating their effectiveness" (Secure). These are exactly the errors I see in GCSE mock exams.

**Secondary concepts:** Climate Change, Development Gap, Map Skills, and Statistical Skills are all valid secondary concepts for a tectonic hazards unit. However, Climate Change and the Development Gap are major topics in their own right -- each would typically be a 10-15 lesson unit. Including them as "secondary concepts" in a tectonic hazards planner dilutes the focus. The planner should distinguish between:
- Concepts that are integral to this unit (Map Skills, Statistical Skills -- you need these to study tectonic hazards)
- Concepts that connect to this unit (Climate Change -- tangentially related via environmental change; Development Gap -- directly relevant via differential impacts)

The Development Gap concept is genuinely useful here because differential impact is the core analytical skill. But Climate Change is a stretch -- climate change does not cause tectonic hazards (a common student misconception that including it here might reinforce).

### 4. Subject-Specific Content

The study scope section provides useful framing:
- Scale: Global
- Themes: plate tectonics, earthquake management, volcanic hazards, vulnerability, resilience
- Map types: hazard overlay, GIS, choropleth, cross section
- Data sources: USGS, BGS, NOAA, World Bank

The map types list is strong. "Hazard overlay" and "cross section" are specifically relevant to tectonic hazards. "Choropleth" is needed for mapping vulnerability indices. "GIS" connects to the cartographic skills concept.

The data source list (USGS, BGS, NOAA, World Bank) is excellent for exam preparation. GCSE Geography expects students to use real data, and these are the authoritative sources. However, the planner does not provide any actual data or explain how to access and use these sources. The difference between listing "USGS" and providing "USGS Earthquake Hazards Program: earthquake.usgs.gov -- search for recent earthquakes by magnitude and location, show students the real-time earthquake map" is the difference between a reference and a teaching resource.

**Locations:** Three locations are listed:
- Port-au-Prince (no description)
- Tohoku Region (no description)
- Arctic (no description)

The first two are correct and essential GCSE case studies (Haiti 2010 and Japan 2011). But they have empty descriptions. A GCSE planner for tectonic hazards must include case study detail:

- Port-au-Prince, Haiti: "12 January 2010, magnitude 7.0, shallow focus (13km). 316,000 deaths, 1.5 million displaced, $8 billion damage. LIC context: 80% of buildings not earthquake-resistant, no building codes enforced, no earthquake warning system, inadequate emergency services."
- Tohoku Region, Japan: "11 March 2011, magnitude 9.0, triggered 40m tsunami. 15,899 deaths, mostly from tsunami not shaking. HIC context: strict building codes, earthquake early warning system (gave 8-30 seconds), well-rehearsed tsunami evacuation procedures, but Fukushima nuclear plant failure showed limits of preparation."

"Arctic" does not belong in a tectonic hazards unit. It is not a tectonic hazard location. This appears to be a data error -- perhaps pulled from a Climate Change or Physical Geography location list.

**Contrasting localities:** "Haiti vs Japan: Development and Disaster" is listed with an empty description. This is the correct contrasting case study pair -- it is the standard GCSE comparison. But without any comparative data, a teacher cannot use this for exam preparation.

### 5. Thinking Lenses

No thinking lenses are present. For tectonic hazards, "Cause and Effect" would be the natural primary lens: "What causes earthquakes at plate boundaries? What are the immediate and longer-term effects? How does the cause-effect chain differ between HIC and LIC contexts?"

"Scale, Proportion and Quantity" would also apply: "How does earthquake magnitude relate to impact? Why is magnitude not the only factor determining devastation?"

The absence of thinking lenses is consistent with the other ontology-based planners (Art, DT). The lens integration exists for ConceptCluster-based planners but has not been extended to the per-subject ontology.

### 6. Session Structure / Vehicle Templates

No session structure or lesson-by-lesson plan for a 10-lesson unit. For GCSE Geography, lesson sequencing matters enormously because the content builds cumulatively:

1-2. Plate tectonics theory (boundary types, convection currents, mantle dynamics)
3. Global distribution of earthquakes and volcanoes (mapping exercise)
4. Earthquake case study 1: Haiti 2010 (LIC context)
5. Earthquake case study 2: Japan 2011 (HIC context)
6. Comparative analysis: why differential impacts? (the key GCSE skill)
7. Volcanic hazards: processes and impacts (distinct from earthquake hazards)
8. Management strategies: monitoring, prediction, protection, preparation
9. Evaluation of management strategies (assess/evaluate question practice)
10. Exam technique: command words, mark scheme, timed practice

Without this structure, a teacher planning from this planner would need to design the entire 10-lesson sequence themselves. For an experienced GCSE teacher, this is straightforward. For an NQT or a teacher new to the specification, the absence of structure is a significant barrier.

### 7. Cross-Curricular Opportunities

One link is provided: "Non-European Societies and Global Perspectives" connected to "colonial history and present-day vulnerability." The strength is "Moderate."

This is a valid link -- the relationship between colonial exploitation and contemporary vulnerability to natural hazards is an important geographical concept. However, the subject column shows "None" (the same rendering bug seen in all planners).

Missing cross-curricular links for KS4 tectonic hazards:
- **Science (Physics):** Seismic waves (P-waves, S-waves, surface waves), wave refraction and reflection. GCSE Physics covers waves; linking to earthquake seismology is natural.
- **Mathematics:** Logarithmic scales (Richter/moment magnitude), statistical correlation (development indicators vs death tolls), scatter graph interpretation.
- **History:** Colonial legacy and its effect on vulnerability -- this connects to the development gap analysis.

The Maths connection is particularly important for GCSE because the statistical skills concept is already listed as a secondary concept. Making the cross-curricular link explicit would strengthen both the Geography and the Maths teaching.

### 8. Sequencing

"Follows: Haiti 2010 Earthquake" -- this is useful sequencing information. It tells me this unit builds on a prior case study of the Haiti earthquake, which means pupils should already have factual knowledge about the Haiti event before this unit contextualises it within broader tectonic hazard theory.

However, I would also want to know what follows this unit. Does it precede Weather Hazards? Climate Change? The sequencing is one-directional.

### 9. Pitfalls, Sensitive Content, Success Criteria

**Pitfalls:** Three strong entries:
1. "Describing plate boundary types without explaining WHY plates move (convection currents, ridge push, slab pull)." This is a common exam error -- students describe the boundary but cannot explain the driving mechanism. Marks are lost for this in every exam series.
2. "Comparing HIC and LIC earthquake impacts without analysing the specific factors (governance, infrastructure, corruption) that create vulnerability." This targets the highest-level GCSE skill. Students who list differences without explaining the mechanisms behind them cap their marks at Grade 5.
3. "Treating volcanoes and earthquakes as identical hazards when their management strategies differ fundamentally." This is a subtle but important point. Earthquake prediction is near-impossible; volcanic eruptions can often be predicted weeks in advance through seismic monitoring, gas emissions, and ground deformation. Students who conflate the two lose marks on management evaluation questions.

All three pitfalls are exam-relevant and specific. They demonstrate genuine understanding of where GCSE students lose marks.

**Sensitive content:** Two entries:
1. "Recent earthquake events may have affected pupils or their families -- establish sensitivity before teaching." Appropriate and important. In any class, there may be students with personal connections to tectonic disasters, particularly students from earthquake-prone countries.
2. "Avoid sensationalising death tolls -- analyse them as data points that reveal vulnerability patterns." This is excellent pedagogical advice. Death tolls should be treated with respect and used analytically, not for shock value.

**Success criteria:** Four clear criteria:
1. "Explain why tectonic hazards occur at plate boundaries using process knowledge"
2. "Compare impacts and responses in HIC and LIC/NEE named case studies"
3. "Evaluate the effectiveness of monitoring, prediction and protection strategies"
4. "Analyse why some communities are more vulnerable than others"

These map directly to GCSE command words: explain (4 marks), compare (6 marks), evaluate (9 marks), analyse (9 marks). The progression from AO1 (knowledge) through AO2 (application) to AO3 (evaluation) is correct. This is a strong section.

### 10. Vocabulary

Ten terms: plate boundary, subduction, convection current, focus, epicentre, magnitude, seismometer, pyroclastic flow, lahar, primary vs secondary hazard.

The selection is appropriate for GCSE. "Pyroclastic flow" and "lahar" are specialist volcanic hazard terms that students must know. "Primary vs secondary hazard" is a key analytical distinction (the earthquake is the primary hazard; the tsunami, landslide, or fire that follows is secondary).

As with all three planners, definitions are empty. For GCSE, precise definitions matter -- exam boards award marks for correct use of specialist terminology. "Subduction" must be defined as "the process where one tectonic plate is forced beneath another at a destructive plate boundary" not just "plates going under each other." Empty definitions undermine the planner's usefulness for exam preparation.

## What I Could Teach From This Planner (Without External Resources)

1. I could set clear learning objectives and success criteria. The four success criteria map to GCSE command words and assessment objectives. I know exactly what standard I am aiming for.

2. I could plan differentiated assessment using the four-level differentiation tables. The Emerging/Developing/Secure/Mastery descriptors are well-calibrated to GCSE grades and the example tasks are genuine exam-style questions with correct mark allocations.

3. I could structure the comparative analysis lesson (Haiti vs Japan) using the differential impact framework in the teaching guidance. "Why does the same magnitude earthquake kill more people in a low-income country?" is the central GCSE question and the planner frames it correctly.

4. I could address common exam errors using the pitfalls. "Describing without explaining," "listing without analysing," and "conflating earthquakes and volcanoes" are the three most common errors in GCSE tectonic hazards answers, and all three are identified.

5. I could plan the enquiry structure around the overarching question ("Can we ever be truly prepared?") with the assessment guidance providing sub-questions.

6. I could handle sensitive content appropriately. The notes about personal connections and respectful treatment of death tolls are important and practical.

## What I Would Still Need to Create Myself

1. **Case study detail.** The locations (Port-au-Prince, Tohoku) are named but have no data. For GCSE, students need specific facts: dates, magnitudes, death tolls, economic costs, specific management strategies, specific failures. I would need to research and compile all case study data myself.

2. **A 10-lesson scheme of work.** No lesson-by-lesson structure exists. I would need to sequence the content from plate theory through case studies to management evaluation.

3. **Exam technique resources.** GCSE Geography requires explicit teaching of command words (describe, explain, compare, assess, evaluate, "to what extent"), mark scheme structure (AO1/AO2/AO3 split), and timed writing practice. None of this is in the planner.

4. **Vocabulary definitions.** All 10 definitions are empty. For GCSE, precise technical definitions are assessed.

5. **Map and data resources.** The planner lists data sources (USGS, BGS) and map types (hazard overlay, choropleth) but provides no actual data, maps, or resource links. I would need to source plate boundary maps, seismic hazard maps, case study photographs, and climate/vulnerability data.

6. **Removal of the Arctic location.** The Arctic is not a tectonic hazard location and should not appear in this planner. I would need to replace it with a volcanic hazard case study location (e.g., Montserrat, Mount Pinatubo, Eyjafjallajokull).

7. **Clarification of secondary concept relevance.** Climate Change as a secondary concept in a tectonic hazards unit needs justification or removal. It risks reinforcing the misconception that climate change causes earthquakes.

## Comparison to V7

In V7, I reviewed a KS2 cluster (Climate Zones, Biomes and the Water Cycle) and scored it 5.0/10. That review was at a fundamentally different key stage and from a different data layer (ConceptClusters). The KS2 planner had no DifficultyLevels, no content vehicles, no worked examples, and no fieldwork specification. I had to invent activities, resources, and data sources from my own subject knowledge.

This KS4 planner scores 7.0/10, a significant improvement. The key differences:

1. **Differentiation is dramatically better.** The four-level GCSE differentiation with exam-style example tasks and mark allocations is a step change from the V7 experience where I had no difficulty data at all. This is DifficultyLevel-quality data embedded in the GeoStudy nodes.

2. **Teaching guidance is exam-focused.** The guidance about differential impacts, the hazard management cycle, and case study specificity is directly aligned to GCSE exam requirements. The V7 guidance was curriculum-generic.

3. **Pitfalls are exam-specific.** "Describing without explaining" and "listing without analysing" are GCSE marking errors, not just general pedagogical advice.

4. **Success criteria map to command words.** The V7 planner had no success criteria. This planner's four criteria map to describe/compare/evaluate/analyse at the correct mark allocations.

Where the V7 planner was stronger: it had thinking lenses (Systems and System Models) with age-banded prompts and question stems. These are absent from this KS4 planner. The V7 planner also had more detailed cross-curricular analysis, even though the links were partial.

The 2-point improvement (5.0 to 7.0) reflects the per-subject ontology's strength at carrying subject-specific content. The GeoStudy nodes provide scale, themes, map types, data sources, locations, contrasting localities, and assessment guidance that the ConceptCluster layer could not. What the ontology loses is the pedagogical infrastructure (thinking lenses, vehicle templates, lesson structure) that the cluster layer provides through its connections to the broader graph.

## Score: 7.0 / 10

The strongest of the three planners I am aware of being reviewed in this V8 round. The concept differentiation is genuinely GCSE-calibrated, the teaching guidance is exam-focused, and the pitfalls/sensitive content/success criteria sections are all practically useful. The main gaps are case study detail, lesson structure, vocabulary definitions, and exam technique resources. For an experienced GCSE teacher, this planner provides a solid content framework that would save approximately 40% of planning time. For an NQT, the missing lesson structure and case study data would still require significant additional preparation.
