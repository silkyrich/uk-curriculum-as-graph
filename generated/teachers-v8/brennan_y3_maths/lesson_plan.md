# Lesson Plan: Measuring in Mixed Units (Length, Mass, Volume)

**Teacher:** Ms. Brennan (Y3, Leeds)
**Cluster:** MA-Y3-D005-CL001 — Measure in mixed units and calculate perimeter (introduction)
**Focus concept:** MA-Y3-C030 — Measuring in mixed units (length, mass, volume)
**Date:** Graph data review, February 2026
**Duration:** 45 minutes

---

## Why This Concept First

The cluster contains two concepts: mixed-unit measurement (C030, weight 3) and perimeter (C031, weight 2). Mixed-unit measurement is the prerequisite skill — children need to measure accurately in cm and mm before they can measure the sides of shapes for perimeter. This lesson covers C030 only; perimeter follows in the next lesson once children are secure with rulers and recording in mixed units.

## 1. Learning Objective

**National Curriculum:** Measure, compare, add and subtract: lengths (m/cm/mm); mass (kg/g); volume/capacity (l/ml). *(Y3 Measurement)*

**By the end of this lesson, pupils will:**
- Measure real objects accurately using rulers (mm and cm), kitchen scales (g and kg), and measuring jugs (ml and l)
- Record measurements in mixed units (e.g. 1 m 45 cm, 2 kg 300 g)
- Know the key equivalences: 1 m = 100 cm, 1 kg = 1000 g, 1 l = 1000 ml, 1 km = 1000 m
- Convert between mixed units and a single unit (e.g. 1 m 35 cm = 135 cm)

---

## 2. Success Criteria

**All pupils (Entry):**
- I can measure an object using a ruler and record the measurement in centimetres
- I can weigh an object on kitchen scales and record the measurement in grams or kilograms

**Most pupils (Developing):**
- I can record a measurement in mixed units (e.g. 1 m and 35 cm)
- I can state that 1 m = 100 cm, 1 kg = 1000 g, and 1 l = 1000 ml
- I can convert a mixed-unit measurement to a single unit (e.g. 1 m 35 cm = 135 cm)

**Some pupils (Expected):**
- I can add and subtract measurements in mixed units by converting to a single unit first
- I can solve problems like: "A bag weighs 2 kg 400 g. Another weighs 1 kg 750 g. What is their total weight?"

**Greater depth:**
- I can solve multi-step measurement problems involving comparison and conversion
- I can explain my reasoning and choose the most sensible unit for the context

*Data source: Success criteria derived directly from DifficultyLevel tier descriptions and example tasks on MA-Y3-C030.*

## 3. CPA Progression

This is the backbone of the lesson. Every phase is grounded in the RepresentationStage data from the graph.

### Concrete (15 minutes of lesson time)
Measuring real objects using rulers (mm/cm/m), kitchen scales (g/kg), and measuring jugs (ml/l). Recording measurements in mixed units. Practising unit conversions with physical equipment.

**Resources needed:**
- 30 cm rulers with mm markings (1 per child)
- Metre sticks (1 per table)
- Kitchen scales reading g/kg (1 per table)
- Measuring jugs reading ml/l (1 per table)
- Balance scales (demonstration)
- Classroom objects to measure: pencils, books, water bottles, bags of rice/pasta, fruit

**Transition cue (from graph):** Child reads measuring instruments accurately in mixed units and converts between units using the x1000 relationship (1 kg = 1000 g, 1 l = 1000 ml, 1 km = 1000 m).

### Pictorial (10 minutes of lesson time)
Drawing scales on number lines showing conversions between units. Recording measurements in tables. Using bar models to add and subtract mixed-unit measurements.

**Resources needed:**
- Number line templates (0-1000 for g/ml, 0-100 for cm)
- Bar model template
- Conversion tables
- Scale-reading worksheets

**Transition cue (from graph):** Child records conversions and calculations on paper without measuring equipment, correctly converting between mixed units and single units.

### Abstract (addressed in independent practice / plenary)
Converting between metric units mentally. Adding and subtracting measurements in mixed units. Selecting appropriate units for different contexts.

**Transition cue (from graph):** Child converts between metric units fluently and selects the most appropriate unit for any given measurement context.

## 5. Lesson Sequence

### Warm-Up (5 minutes)

**0-2 min: Prerequisite check**
Hold up a 30 cm ruler. "What unit does this measure in?" (cm). "How many centimetres in this ruler?" (30). "About how long is your pencil? Show me with your fingers." Quick check of Y2 measurement fluency.

Place a 1 kg bag of sugar and a pencil on the table. "Which is heavier? How do you know? What unit would we use to weigh the sugar?" (kg). "What about the pencil?" (g).

**2-5 min: Challenge problem (productive failure)**
Per pedagogy profile: *"Start with a challenge problem -- do not explain first."*

Give each table a metre stick and a piece of string approximately 1 m 45 cm long. Card reads: "How long is this string? Write down your answer."

Do NOT explain. Let them attempt for 2-3 minutes. Circulate and observe:
- Do they use the metre stick? The ruler? Both?
- How do they record the answer? "145 cm"? "1 m and a bit"? "1 m 45 cm"?

Collect responses on the board: "Table 1 wrote 145 cm. Table 2 wrote 1 m and 45 cm. Table 3 wrote 1 metre 45. Are these all the same? Which way is clearest?"

This surfaces the core learning point: we need a consistent way to record measurements that are longer than one unit.

### Teach -- Concrete Phase (15 minutes)

**5-10 min: Worked example -- measuring length in mixed units (I Do)**

"Today we are going to measure real things -- and write down EXACTLY how long, heavy, or full they are, using mixed units."

Hold up the metre stick beside a table edge. Demonstrate:
- Step 1: "The table is longer than 1 metre. I lay the metre stick along the edge -- that's 1 metre."
- Step 2: "There's a gap left over. I use my 30 cm ruler to measure the gap. It's 23 cm."
- Step 3: "So the table is 1 m 23 cm."
- Step 4: "Can I write this as just centimetres? 1 m = 100 cm, plus 23 cm = 123 cm. That's the same length, two different ways."

Write on the board: **1 m 23 cm = 123 cm** and underneath: **1 m = 100 cm (so multiply the metres by 100 and add the centimetres)**

"Now the important bit. Milli-metre." Show the mm markings on the ruler. "This is new in Year 3. There are 10 tiny millimetres in every centimetre. When we need to be really precise, we use millimetres."

Measure a pencil: "This pencil is 14 cm and 7 mm. We write 14 cm 7 mm, or 147 mm."

**10-15 min: Guided practice -- measuring in mixed units (We Do)**

Each table has: rulers, kitchen scales, measuring jugs, and 4 objects to measure.

Station rotation (3 minutes per station, tables rotate):
- **Length station:** Measure a book, a shoe, and a piece of string. Record in cm and mm.
- **Mass station:** Weigh a bag of pasta, an apple, and a pencil case. Record in kg and g, or just g.
- **Capacity station:** Pour water into measuring jugs. Read the scale. Record in ml.

Teaching point (from misconceptions data): "Watch out -- some children write 45 mm when they mean 45 cm. Millimetres are the tiny lines BETWEEN the centimetre marks. Centimetres are the numbered lines."

**15-20 min: Key equivalences (We Do)**

Write on the board, building from children's measurements:

| "kilo" means 1000 | |
|---|---|
| 1 kilometre = 1000 metres | 1 km = 1000 m |
| 1 kilogram = 1000 grams | 1 kg = 1000 g |
| 1 litre = 1000 millilitres | 1 l = 1000 ml |

"What's the same about all of these? The prefix 'kilo' always means 1000."

Also: 1 m = 100 cm, and 1 cm = 10 mm.

**Pattern Discovery** (from interaction type guidance): "What do you notice about the numbers 10, 100, 1000? Why do you think metric units use these numbers?" Collect observations without correcting.

### Teach -- Pictorial Phase (8 minutes)

**20-25 min: Recording and converting on paper**

Move from physical equipment to number lines and tables.

**Worked example -- conversion using a bar model:**
"A parcel weighs 2 kg 300 g. How many grams is that?"

Draw a bar model:
```
[  1 kg = 1000 g  |  1 kg = 1000 g  |  300 g  ]
```
"2 lots of 1000 g = 2000 g. Plus 300 g = 2300 g."

Write: **2 kg 300 g = 2300 g**

**Guided practice on number lines:**
- Show a number line 0 g to 2000 g. "Where is 1 kg 500 g?" Mark it. "That's 1500 g."
- Show a number line 0 cm to 200 cm. "Where is 1 m 75 cm?" Mark it. "That's 175 cm."

Children complete 3 conversion questions on mini whiteboards:
1. 1 m 50 cm = ___ cm (150)
2. 3 kg 200 g = ___ g (3200)
3. 2 l 750 ml = ___ ml (2750)

Quick check: "Show me!" Scan whiteboards.

Teaching point (from misconceptions data): "Some people multiply by 10 instead of 100 when converting cm to m. Remember: 1 m = 100 cm, not 10 cm. If you're not sure, lay your ruler along the metre stick and count."

### Practice -- Differentiated (10 minutes)

**25-35 min: Independent practice**

Children self-select or are directed to the appropriate tier:

**Support (Entry):**
Measuring objects using a ruler (cm and mm) and kitchen scales (g/kg), recording the measurement in the correct unit. Concrete manipulatives available throughout.
- Measure this pencil to the nearest centimetre.
- Weigh this bag of rice on the scales. Is it closer to 500 g or 1 kg?
- Measure the length of your maths book in cm. Now measure in mm.

**Core (Developing):**
Recording measurements in mixed units and stating equivalences.
- A table is 1 m and 35 cm long. Write this in centimetres only.
- Convert: 2 kg 600 g = ___ g
- Convert: 1 l 250 ml = ___ ml
- What is 3 m in centimetres?

**Challenge (Expected):**
Adding and subtracting measurements in mixed units, converting to a single unit first.
- A bag weighs 2 kg 400 g. Another bag weighs 1 kg 750 g. What is their total weight? Give your answer in kg and g.
- A jug holds 1 l 500 ml. I pour out 750 ml. How much is left?
- A shelf is 2 m 10 cm long. A book is 35 cm wide. How much shelf is left after placing the book?

**Greater Depth:**
Multi-step measurement problems involving comparison and conversion.
- A ribbon is 2 m 30 cm long. I cut off 85 cm. How much is left? Give your answer in metres and centimetres.
- Three parcels weigh 1 kg 200 g, 800 g, and 2 kg 50 g. What is their total weight in kg and g? Which parcel is heaviest? By how much?

*Data source: Every differentiated task drawn from or closely adapted from DifficultyLevel example_task data on MA-Y3-C030.*

### Plenary (7 minutes)

**35-38 min: Retrieval practice with interleaving**
Per pedagogy profile: *"Follow with 3-4 retrieval practice questions that mix this concept with previously mastered material."*

Quick-fire on whiteboards:
1. 1 kg = ___ g (measurement -- today)
2. 347 + 265 = ___ (column addition -- from prerequisite domain MA-Y3-D002)
3. 2 m 40 cm = ___ cm (conversion -- today)
4. What is double 350? (mental arithmetic -- previous topic)

**38-42 min: Address the challenge problem**
Return to the string from the warm-up. "Now you know about mixed units -- how long is the string? Write it in mixed units AND in centimetres only."

Compare with their original attempts. "What do you know now that you didn't know 40 minutes ago?"

Per feedback profile: *"Name the pattern, rule, or skill the child demonstrated."* Example: "You converted from mixed units to centimetres -- you used the rule that 1 m = 100 cm to do it. That's exactly what mathematicians do."

**42-45 min: Exit ticket**
On a slip of paper:
- Q1 (Entry): Measure this line to the nearest cm. *(draw a 7.3 cm line)*
- Q2 (Developing): 1 m 60 cm = ___ cm
- Q3 (Expected): A bottle holds 1 l 350 ml. I pour in another 700 ml. How much is in the bottle now? Give your answer in l and ml.

Collect. Sort into 3 piles: secure / developing / needs intervention. This determines tomorrow's starting point.

## 7. Assessment Opportunities

| When | What to look for | Linked to |
|---|---|---|
| Challenge problem (warm-up) | Do children attempt to use the metre stick? How do they record "more than 1 m"? | Prior knowledge; readiness for mixed units |
| Concrete stations (teach) | Can children read scales accurately? Do they confuse mm and cm? | Entry DL tier; misconception: mm/cm confusion |
| Whiteboard conversions (pictorial) | Do children multiply by 100 (correct) or by 10 (misconception)? | Developing DL tier; misconception: wrong conversion factor |
| Independent practice | Which tier are children working at? Are Expected children converting before adding? | All DL tiers |
| Exit ticket | 3 questions spanning Entry-Expected; reveals who needs same-day intervention | Summative snapshot for this lesson |

## 9. Connections

**Prerequisite (from graph):** Formal columnar addition (MA-Y3-D002) -- children need to add multi-digit numbers when combining measurements. Check this is secure.

**Next lesson:** Perimeter of simple 2-D shapes (MA-Y3-C031) -- children will apply their measuring skills to find the distance around shapes. The concrete-first approach continues: walk the perimeter, measure with string, then calculate from given dimensions.

**Cross-domain (from thinking lens -- Scale, Proportion and Quantity):** The conversion factor "kilo = 1000" connects directly to place value work. 1 m = 100 cm encodes a scale factor of 100. Ask: "How many times bigger is a metre than a centimetre?"

**Cross-curricular (inferred, not in graph):**
- Science: measuring in investigations (mass of materials, volume of liquids)
- Cooking/DT: weighing ingredients in g/kg, measuring liquids in ml/l
- Geography: distances in km on maps
- PE: measuring jump distances, running track lengths
