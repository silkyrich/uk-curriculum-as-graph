# Lesson Context: Measure in mixed units and calculate perimeter

> **Cluster**: `MA-Y3-D005-CL001` | Type: introduction |  ✓ Curated

## Overview

- **Subject**: Mathematics
- **Year group**: Y3 *(year override — learner profile reflects this year, not domain anchor)* (None)
- **Domain**: Measurement (`MA-Y3-D005`)
- **Estimated teaching time**: None lessons (~None weeks)
- **Modelled on**: CC Math 3.MD.B.4 - Measure lengths using rulers to the nearest half and quarter inch

### Pedagogical rationale

Mixed-unit measurement and perimeter are both applied measurement skills that connect to number work and shape. They form the practical measurement cluster.

## Curriculum context

In Year 3, the measurement domain significantly extends KS1 knowledge by introducing millimetres, mixed units (e.g. 1 m and 50 cm), simple metric equivalents, and calculating the perimeter of 2-D shapes for the first time. The non-statutory guidance indicates that pupils continue to measure using a range of instruments, read scales with increasing accuracy in a range of contexts, and that they should be able to carry out additions and subtractions with measurements in the same units. Money work progresses to include formal £ and p notation and giving change, while time is extended to Roman numerals on clock faces, 12- and 24-hour clocks, and reading the time to the nearest minute. These practical measurement skills reinforce pupils' number understanding in applied contexts and connect directly to the formal calculation methods being developed in the number domains.

## Domain progression

All clusters in this domain (in sequence):

- `MA-Y3-D005-CL001` [introduction] Measure in mixed units and calculate perimeter **→ THIS CLUSTER**
- `MA-Y3-D005-CL002` [practice] Calculate with money and read the time accurately 

**Leads to**: `MA-Y3-D005-CL002` — Calculate with money and read the time accurately

## Thinking lenses

*The following lenses apply to this cluster. Each is a valid framing — choose the one that fits your lesson angle.*

### Scale, Proportion and Quantity *(recommended)*

*Reasoning about size, number, and measurement across different scales; understanding ratios and relative magnitude.*

**Why this lens fits:** Mixed-unit measurement (m and cm, kg and g) develops pupils' understanding of the proportional relationship between units — 1 m = 100 cm encodes a scale factor of 100 that pupils must apply fluently.

> **Key question for pupils:** _How big, how many, or how much — and how does that change how we think about it?_

> **AI instruction:** Use the SCALE, PROPORTION AND QUANTITY lens: prompt pupils to measure and compare using standard units, understand simple fractions and proportions, use bar models or diagrams to show relative size, and choose appropriate units. Introduce 'how many times bigger' language.

**Question stems:**
- How many times bigger is this than that?
- What fraction of the whole is this part?
- Which unit of measurement fits best here? Why?
- If we doubled the amount, what would change?

### Structure and Function

*Connecting how something is built or arranged (structure) to what it does or enables (function).*

**Why this lens fits:** Perimeter is determined by a shape's structural properties — the total length around the boundary is a direct consequence of the side lengths, making it an early application of structure-to-measurement reasoning.

> **Key question for pupils:** _How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?_

> **AI instruction:** Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to connect how things are built or arranged to what they do. Compare different structures that serve similar functions. Encourage pupils to explain why a particular design feature helps something work, and to sketch design alternatives.

**Question stems:**
- How does the shape or arrangement help it do its job?
- Can you find two different structures that do the same thing? How do they compare?
- If you were designing this, what would you keep and what would you change?
- Why is this material or structure better suited than another?

## Prerequisite knowledge

Pupils should already be able to:

- **Formal columnar addition** (from `MA-Y3-D002` — Number - Addition and Subtraction)

### Measuring in mixed units (length, mass, volume)
*`MA-Y3-C030` · skill · weight 3*

In Year 3, pupils work with measurements given in mixed units — for example, 1 m 45 cm, 2 kg 300 g, 1 l 250 ml — and perform calculations with such measurements. They also recognise simple equivalents (e.g. 1 km = 1000 m, 1 m = 100 cm, 1 m = 1000 mm, 1 kg = 1000 g, 1 l = 1000 ml). Mastery means pupils can read measuring instruments accurately, record measurements in appropriate units, and carry out addition and subtraction with measurements.

**Teaching guidance:** Use real measuring instruments: rulers in mm/cm/m, kitchen scales in g/kg, measuring jugs in ml/l. The curriculum specifies mm is introduced in Year 3, so ensure this unit is covered. Simple equivalents: use the pattern that kilo- means 1000, so 1 kilogram = 1000 grams, 1 kilometre = 1000 metres. Connect to place value: 1 m 45 cm = 145 cm (multiply metres by 100 and add centimetres). Practise reading scales with non-standard intervals.

**Key vocabulary:** millimetre, centimetre, metre, kilometre, gram, kilogram, millilitre, litre, equivalent, convert, mixed units, measure, scale

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils confuse mm and cm (writing 45 mm as 45 cm). They may add mixed units without converting (1 m 70 cm + 50 cm = 1 m 120 cm rather than 2 m 20 cm). Converting between units requires the multiplication/division knowledge from the number domain, and pupils often use the wrong conversion factor (multiplying by 10 rather than 100 for cm to mm).

**Difficulty levels:**
1. **Entry**: Measuring objects using a ruler (cm and mm) and a set of kitchen scales (g/kg), recording the measurement in the correct unit. — *"Measure this pencil to the nearest centimetre. Weigh this bag of rice on the scales."*
2. **Developing**: Recording measurements in mixed units and knowing simple equivalences (1 m = 100 cm, 1 kg = 1000 g, 1 l = 1000 ml). — *"A table is 1 m and 35 cm long. Write this in centimetres only."*
3. **Expected**: Adding and subtracting measurements in mixed units, converting to a single unit first. — *"A bag weighs 2 kg 400 g. Another bag weighs 1 kg 750 g. What is their total weight?"*
4. **Greater Depth**: Solving multi-step measurement problems involving comparison and conversion between units. — *"A ribbon is 2 m 30 cm long. I cut off 85 cm. How much is left? Give your answer in metres and centimetres."*

**CPA stages (Concrete → Pictorial → Abstract):**
1. **Concrete**: Measuring real objects using rulers (mm/cm/m), kitchen scales (g/kg) and measuring jugs (ml/l), recording measurements in mixed units and practising unit conversions with physical equipment
   Resources: 30 cm rulers (mm markings), metre sticks, kitchen scales (g/kg), measuring jugs (ml/l), balance scales, classroom objects to measure
   *Transition cue:* Child reads measuring instruments accurately in mixed units and converts between units using the ×1000 relationship (1 kg = 1000 g, 1 l = 1000 ml, 1 km = 1000 m)
2. **Pictorial**: Drawing scales on number lines showing conversions between units, recording measurements in tables, and using bar models to add and subtract mixed-unit measurements
   Resources: number line templates (0-1000 for g/ml, 0-100 for cm), bar model template, conversion tables, scale-reading worksheets
   *Transition cue:* Child records conversions and calculations on paper without measuring equipment, correctly converting between mixed units and single units
3. **Abstract**: Converting between metric units mentally, adding and subtracting measurements in mixed units, and selecting appropriate units for different contexts
   *Transition cue:* Child converts between metric units fluently and selects the most appropriate unit for any given measurement context

### Perimeter of simple 2-D shapes
*`MA-Y3-C031` · knowledge · weight 2*

Perimeter is the distance around the boundary of a flat (2-D) shape, found by adding the lengths of all its sides. In Year 3, pupils measure the perimeter of simple rectilinear shapes. Mastery means pupils understand perimeter as a length measurement (in mm, cm or m), can measure sides accurately and add them, and can distinguish perimeter from area.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce perimeter physically: pupils walk the perimeter of the playground or run a finger around the edge of a shape. Measure sides using a ruler and record each length before adding. Simple rectilinear shapes (made from squares on squared paper) allow pupils to count squares along each side before measuring. Emphasise: perimeter is the total length around the outside, not the space inside (which is area). Use the formula for a rectangle (2 × length + 2 × width) informally at this stage.

**Key vocabulary:** perimeter, boundary, edge, distance, measure, length, add, total, centimetre, metre

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils frequently confuse perimeter (length around the outside) with area (space inside). They may count the squares of a shape (area) rather than measuring around its edge (perimeter). When measuring rectilinear shapes, pupils sometimes miss a side or count a vertex rather than a side. On shapes with equal opposite sides, pupils may only measure two sides and forget to double them.

**Difficulty levels:**
1. **Entry**: Tracing around a shape on squared paper and counting the unit lengths along each side to find the perimeter. — *"A rectangle on squared paper is 4 squares long and 2 squares wide. Trace around the outside and count the units."*
2. **Developing**: Measuring the sides of simple shapes with a ruler and adding the lengths to find the perimeter. — *"Measure each side of this triangle with a ruler and find its perimeter."*
3. **Expected**: Calculating the perimeter of rectilinear shapes where some side lengths are given and others must be deduced. — *"A rectangle has a length of 8 cm and a width of 3 cm. What is its perimeter?"*
4. **Greater Depth**: Finding the perimeter of compound rectilinear shapes (L-shapes) where missing side lengths must be calculated. — *"An L-shape has outer dimensions 6 cm by 4 cm, with a 2 cm by 2 cm square cut from one corner. Find the perimeter."*

**CPA stages (Concrete → Pictorial → Abstract):**
1. **Concrete**: Walking the perimeter of the classroom, playground and large shapes taped on the floor, then measuring the perimeter of smaller shapes using string laid along edges and a ruler
   Resources: string, rulers, metre sticks, masking tape (for floor shapes), classroom objects (books, tables)
   *Transition cue:* Child measures all sides of a shape and adds them to find the perimeter without being reminded to include every side
2. **Pictorial**: Drawing rectilinear shapes on squared paper and counting/adding side lengths to calculate perimeter, labelling each side measurement on the diagram
   Resources: squared paper (1 cm grid), ruler, rectilinear shape templates
   *Transition cue:* Child labels all sides of any rectilinear shape and calculates perimeter correctly, clearly distinguishing perimeter (distance around) from area (space inside)
3. **Abstract**: Calculating perimeters of shapes from given dimensions without drawing, including finding missing side lengths of rectilinear shapes
   *Transition cue:* Child calculates perimeters from given measurements and works backwards from a perimeter to find unknown side lengths

- **Lexile range**: 150–350L
- **FK grade max**: 2
- **Max sentence length**: 14 words
- **TTS required**: No
- **Academic vocabulary**: Avoid

> **AI content instruction**: Use clear, active sentences with one idea per sentence. Subject vocabulary can be used if first introduced with a definition. Avoid passive voice.

### Pedagogy profile

- **Session length**: 12–20 minutes
- **Scaffolding**: moderate_to_high
- **Productive failure**: Appropriate ✓
- **Hint tiers**: max 3
- **Spacing interval**: 2–7 days
- **Session sequence**: challenge_problem → guided_exploration → worked_example → independent_practice → retrieval_practice
- **Active desirable difficulties**: spacing, interleaving

> **AI pedagogy instruction**: Start with a challenge problem — do not explain first. Let the child attempt independently for 2–3 minutes. Collect their attempt. Then show the worked example. Follow with 3–4 retrieval practice questions that mix this concept with previously mastered material (interleaving). Contextualize difficulty: 'That one was harder — your brain was working to connect different ideas.'

### Feedback profile

- **Style**: specific_competence
- **AI tone**: warm_competence_focused
- **Gamification**: ⚠ Not safe — avoid
- **Unexpected delight**: Safe ✓ (semi_random)
- **Explicit misconception correction**: Keep implicit
- **Metacognitive reflection**: Not yet
- **Example (correct)**: "You spotted the pattern — all the multiples of 6 end in an even number. That is a really useful thing to notice."
- **Example (incorrect)**: "That one got you — 7×8 trips up a lot of people. Here is a trick: 7×7 is 49, so 7×8 is just 7 more, which gives 56."
- **Avoid phrases**: "Wrong", "Incorrect", "You need to improve", "Well done!", "Amazing!"

> **AI feedback instruction**: Specific competence feedback: name the pattern, rule, or skill the child demonstrated. On error, explain the specific misconception (not just 'wrong') and give the reasoning to fix it. Normalize productive struggle: 'That one took longer — your brain was making new connections.' Never compare to other children or previous performance.

### Interaction types available

**Primary (preferred):**
- **Pattern Discovery — I Notice / I Wonder** (`pattern_discovery`, higher_order)
  > This is the productive failure activation phase — do NOT correct or evaluate observations during discovery. Say 'That is interesting, what else do you notice?' to all responses. After the discovery phase, connect the child's actual observations to the canonical concept: 'You noticed [X] — that is the [Y] pattern.'
- **Drag to Categorise** (`drag_categorise`, manipulation)
  > Limit to 2–3 categories for Y3, up to 4–5 for Y5+. Confirm whether items are mutually exclusive or can belong to multiple categories. In feedback, explain the classification principle, not just the correct placement.
- **Matching Pairs** (`matching_pairs`, manipulation)
  > Limit to 4–5 pairs for Y3–Y4, up to 6–8 pairs for Y5+. Distractors should be near-misses (similar terms, not obviously unrelated). After matching, display all correct pairs simultaneously before moving on.
- **Multiple Choice — 3 Options** (`multi_choice_3`, selection)
  > Provide 1 correct answer and 2 plausible distractors. Distractors should represent common misconceptions, not random wrong answers. Label A/B/C only if children are Y3+.
- **Multiple Choice — 4 Options** (`multi_choice_4`, selection)
  > 1 correct answer + 3 distractors. Each distractor should address a specific, documented misconception from the curriculum domain. Explain why the distractor is wrong in post-answer feedback.
- **Text Input — Single Word** (`text_input_word`, text_input)
