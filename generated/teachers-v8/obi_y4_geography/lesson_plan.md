## Planning Decision: Why This GeoStudy

I am using **GS-GE-KS2-004 (Rivers and the Water Cycle)** as the primary topic suggestion for this lesson. Of the seven GeoStudy nodes that deliver concepts in this cluster, this one delivers both `GE-KS2-C002` and `GE-KS2-C003`, and critically it is tagged with the **fieldwork** template as well as **topic_study**. That dual-template design tells me the graph intends this to be taught through a combination of classroom investigation and outdoor data collection — which is exactly how I would choose to teach it.

The GeoPlace reference node **River Thames** is attached to this study. For my Nottingham pupils I will substitute with the **River Trent** (our local river), but the graph's inclusion of a named river exemplar signals that this topic should be grounded in a specific, real river system — not taught abstractly. That is a significant improvement on V7, where the teaching guidance said "study a specific river" but the graph had zero place references to anchor it.

The GeoContrast reference node **UK Region vs European Region** (attached to GS-GE-KS2-001 and GS-GE-KS2-002) informs the extension task at the end of the lesson: comparing the River Trent's drainage basin with a European river system.

## 1. Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, pupils will be able to:

1. **Label and explain** the key stages of the water cycle (evaporation, condensation, precipitation, run-off, infiltration) as a continuous system with inputs, outputs, and interactions.
2. **Describe** the main features of a river system from source to mouth (source, tributary, meander, flood plain, mouth, drainage basin).
3. **Explain** how rivers shape the landscape through the processes of erosion, transportation, and deposition.
4. **Apply the Systems and System Models lens** to predict what would happen to a river system if one part of the water cycle changed.

**Geographical skills integrated:** Geographical enquiry (formulating questions about river processes), fieldwork awareness (observing water movement in the school grounds).

---

## 2. Success Criteria (from DifficultyLevel tiers)

The graph now provides four DifficultyLevel tiers for `GE-KS2-C003`. I am using these directly:

| Tier | Success criterion | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Entry** | I can label the main stages of the water cycle on a diagram (evaporation, condensation, precipitation). | DL1: "Label this water cycle diagram with the words: evaporation, condensation, precipitation." |
| **Developing** | I can describe the water cycle as a continuous process and identify the main features of a river from source to mouth. | DL2: "Describe what happens to water from the moment it falls as rain on a mountain until it reaches the sea." |
| **Expected** | I can explain how rivers shape the landscape through erosion, transportation, and deposition, and name specific landforms these processes create. | DL3: "How does a river create a meander? What happens to the material that the river erodes?" |
| **Greater depth** | I can evaluate how humans interact with rivers — using them, managing flooding, and modifying river systems — and explain the balance of benefits and risks. | DL4: "Rivers provide benefits but also pose risks. Explain how people manage this balance, using examples." |

**Note:** In V7 I had to construct these tiers from professional judgement. Every one of these is now directly from the graph. The example tasks in each tier are specific, assessable, and well-pitched for Y4. This is a step change.

## 3. Key Vocabulary

From the concept's `key_vocabulary` field, filtered for this lesson's focus:

| Term | Definition (Y4-appropriate, max 18 words) |
|---|---|
| **water cycle** | The continuous movement of water between the ocean, atmosphere, and land. |
| **evaporation** | When water heats up and changes from liquid into water vapour (gas). |
| **condensation** | When water vapour cools and changes from gas back into tiny water droplets. |
| **precipitation** | Water falling from clouds as rain, snow, sleet, or hail. |
| **run-off** | Water that flows over the land surface into streams and rivers. |
| **infiltration** | Water soaking into the ground through the soil. |
| **river** | A large natural stream of water flowing towards the sea, a lake, or another river. |
| **source** | The place where a river begins, often a spring or hilltop. |
| **mouth** | The place where a river flows into the sea or a lake. |
| **tributary** | A smaller river or stream that flows into a larger river. |
| **drainage basin** | The area of land drained by a river and all its tributaries. |
| **meander** | A wide curve or bend in a river, formed by erosion on the outer bank. |
| **flood plain** | The flat area of land alongside a river that floods when the river overflows. |
| **erosion** | The wearing away of rock and soil by water, wind, or ice. |
| **deposition** | When a river drops the material it has been carrying, building up land. |
| **transportation** | When a river carries eroded material downstream. |

Definitions written by me to match the Y4 content guidelines (Lexile 300-500L, max 18 words per sentence, FK grade max 3). The graph provides the term lists but not child-friendly definitions — this remains a gap, though a smaller one than having no terms at all.

## 4. Lesson Sequence with Timings (~50 minutes)

### VehicleTemplate in Use

I am combining two templates from the graph:

**topic_study** (primary structure):
> "Use the TOPIC STUDY template: open with an engaging hook that raises a question or challenge. Build context using a timeline or key facts. Introduce 2-3 sources for pupils to analyse, prompting them to consider who made each source and why. Guide pupils toward forming their own interpretation, supported by evidence from the sources."

**fieldwork** (integrated element):
> "Use the FIELDWORK template: prepare pupils for outdoor data collection with clear instructions and safety guidance. Guide them to use simple equipment such as clipboards, tally charts, thermometers, or maps. Help them organise their data back in the classroom and describe what they found. Encourage pupils to say what their fieldwork results tell them about the place or question."

The topic_study template structures the lesson arc. The fieldwork template informs the practical observation activity. Here is how they combine:

---

### Phase 1: Hook and Challenge Problem (8 minutes)

**[0-3 min] Challenge problem (productive failure):**
Display two photographs side by side: (1) a wide aerial view of the River Trent at Nottingham showing the flood plain, meanders, and urban development alongside the river; (2) a mountain stream in the Peak District showing the same river near its source — narrow, fast, rocky.

Ask: "These are photographs of the SAME river. Why does it look completely different in each photograph? What might explain this?"

Pairs discuss for 90 seconds. No instruction yet — this is productive failure per the Y4 pedagogy profile (challenge_problem first).

*Source: Pedagogy profile session sequence; ThinkingLens Systems key question; topic_study template ("open with an engaging hook that raises a question or challenge").*

**[3-8 min] Elicit prior knowledge and introduce the Systems lens:**

Cold-call responses from pairs. Draw out: the river changes as it flows; water comes from somewhere and goes somewhere; rainfall feeds rivers.

Activate KS1 prerequisite (Weather and Climate from `GE-KS1-D003`): "Where does the water in the River Trent come from? What happens to the rain that falls on the Peak District hills?"

Introduce the Systems lens explicitly: "Today we are thinking about water as a system — a set of parts that are connected, where a change in one part affects all the others." Display the key question on the board:

> *"What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?"*

*Source: ThinkingLens agent_prompt verbatim; prerequisite link to GE-KS1-D003.*

---

### Phase 2: Building Context — The Water Cycle as a System (12 minutes)

**[8-14 min] Collaborative water cycle diagram:**

Teacher draws the water cycle on the board step by step. At each stage, use Socratic questioning (from inference_task interaction type):

- "What do you notice happening to the water at this stage?" (observation)
- "What does that tell you about how the water is moving?" (inference)
- "Why do you think the water changes state here?" (reasoning)

Label all six processes: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, run-off, infiltration, and (introduce) evapotranspiration from plants. Address the misconception directly: "Many people think the water cycle is a simple loop. But look at all the different pathways water can take — it is more like a web than a circle."

*Source: Concept GE-KS2-C003 teaching guidance and misconceptions; inference_task Socratic sequence.*

**[14-20 min] Drag-to-reorder activity:**

Pupils receive 6 cards showing water cycle processes. They sequence them, then — crucially — rearrange to show that the cycle has no single starting point. "Can you reorder these so the cycle starts at a different place? Does it still work? What does this tell you about systems?"

Apply the Systems lens question stem: "What goes into this system, and what comes out?"

*Source: Interaction type drag_reorder (4-6 items for Y4); ThinkingLens question stems.*

---

### Phase 3: The River System — From Source to Mouth (15 minutes)

**[20-28 min] Tracing the River Trent:**

Display a map showing the River Trent from source (Staffordshire Moorlands) to mouth (Humber Estuary). The GeoPlace reference node **River Thames** tells me the graph expects a specific river case study — I am localising to the River Trent because my pupils live alongside it.

Trace the river together. At each stage introduce the key features: source, tributaries (River Soar, River Derwent), meanders (visible on the map near Nottingham), flood plain (Trent Valley), mouth (the Humber).

Matching pairs activity: 5 pairs — river feature name matched to photograph of that feature on the River Trent. After matching, pupils place each pair on a simplified river diagram showing upper, middle, and lower course.

*Source: GeoStudy GS-GE-KS2-004 rationale ("teaching through a specific river case study grounds abstract process understanding in real geographical contexts"); interaction type matching_pairs (4-5 pairs for Y4); GeoPlace: River Thames (localised to River Trent).*

**[28-35 min] Erosion, transportation, and deposition:**

Focus on three processes. Use a simple physical model: a tilted tray with sand, water poured at the top. Pupils observe:
- Where does the water flow fastest? (upper course — erosion)
- What happens to the sand that is picked up? (middle course — transportation)
- Where does it end up? (lower course — deposition)

Connect back to the Systems lens: "If you changed the slope of the tray — made it steeper — what would happen to erosion? To deposition? One change affects the whole system."

*Source: Concept GE-KS2-C003 teaching guidance ("Use diagrams and models to explain"); ThinkingLens question stem: "If you changed this one part, what else would be affected?"*

---

### Phase 4: Cross-Curricular Connection and Enquiry (8 minutes)

**Cross-curricular link used:** Rivers and the Water Cycle --> States of Matter and the Water Cycle (ScienceEnquiry) [strong]
Hook: "States of matter — evaporation, condensation, precipitation as phase changes"

This is the single strongest cross-curricular connection in the cluster and the one I was most frustrated about missing in V7. The graph now surfaces it explicitly with a "strong" strength rating.

**[35-43 min] Connecting Geography and Science:**

"We have been learning about evaporation and condensation as geographical processes in the water cycle. In Science, you learned about these as changes of state — solid, liquid, gas. Let us connect these ideas."

Quick-fire multiple choice (4 options, from multi_choice_4 interaction type):

1. "When water evaporates from the ocean, what change of state is happening?" [liquid to gas / gas to liquid / solid to liquid / liquid to solid]
2. "When water vapour condenses into clouds, what change of state is happening?" [gas to liquid / liquid to gas / solid to gas / gas to solid]
3. "A river carries small rocks downstream. Is this erosion, transportation, or deposition?" [transportation / erosion / deposition / infiltration]

Misconception distractor in Q1: "solid to liquid" targets the misconception that liquid water becomes ice when it evaporates (common Y4 confusion between evaporation and freezing).

*Source: Cross-curricular link GS-GE-KS2-004 --> States of Matter and the Water Cycle [strong]; interaction type multi_choice_4 with misconception distractors from concept data.*

---

### Phase 5: Plenary and Retrieval (7 minutes)

**[43-47 min] Systems check:**

Each table receives a water cycle diagram with one process removed (different process per table). They must: (1) identify what is missing, (2) explain what would happen to the river system without it.

Example: "Infiltration has been removed. What happens?" Expected response: "All the water stays on the surface as run-off. Rivers would flood more easily. The ground would be dry."

*Source: ThinkingLens: "If you changed this one part, what else would be affected?"; DifficultyLevel expected tier task style.*

**[47-50 min] I Notice / I Wonder exit tickets:**

Pupils write:
- "I notice..." (one pattern or connection they spotted — e.g., "I notice that the River Trent gets wider and slower as it moves away from its source")
- "I wonder..." (one question they still have — e.g., "I wonder what would happen to the River Trent if it rained twice as much")

Collect as formative assessment. Preview next lesson: "Next lesson, we will look at climate zones and biomes — the big patterns of temperature and rainfall across the whole world. We will find out why the Amazon looks nothing like Nottingham, even though both places have rivers."

*Source: Interaction type pattern_discovery; domain progression (this cluster covers both concepts; next cluster GE-KS2-D003-CL002 covers settlements and economic geography).*

## 5. Differentiation (Using DifficultyLevel Tiers)

### Support (Entry / Developing — DL1-DL2)
- **Water cycle diagram:** Pre-drawn with boxes and arrows. Pupils add labels from a word bank (6 terms provided, matching the DL1 task: "Label this water cycle diagram").
- **River feature matching:** 4 pairs instead of 5. Photographs have captions as clues.
- **Sentence starters** for the systems check: "If ___ was removed, then ___ would happen because ___."
- **Paired working** throughout all activities.
- **Word mat** on desk with key vocabulary and simple definitions.

### Core (Expected — DL3)
- **Water cycle diagram:** Blank framework with arrows only. Pupils label independently.
- **River feature matching:** 5 pairs, no captions. After matching, pupils write one sentence explaining how erosion creates a meander (DL3 task: "How does a river create a meander?").
- **Systems check:** Full task — identify missing process and explain consequences.

### Extension (Greater Depth — DL4)
- **Water cycle complexity:** Pupils add additional pathways (evapotranspiration, groundwater) to the basic cycle diagram and explain why the simple loop is a model, not the full reality.
- **Human interaction:** "The River Trent flooded Nottingham in 1947 and 2000. Why do communities build near rivers despite the risk? How do people manage this balance?" (DL4 task directly from graph).
- **Cross-continental comparison:** Using the GeoContrast reference (UK Region vs European Region), compare the River Trent's drainage basin with the River Rhine or Danube — how are they similar and different as systems?

*Source: All four DifficultyLevel tiers from GE-KS2-C003; GeoContrast: UK Region vs European Region for extension.*

## 6. Fieldwork Opportunities

The GeoStudy GS-GE-KS2-004 is tagged with the **fieldwork** template, and the VehicleTemplate agent_prompt says: "prepare pupils for outdoor data collection with clear instructions and safety guidance."

### Immediate opportunity (this lesson, if weather and time permit):

**School grounds water observation (10 minutes, replacing part of Phase 2):**

Take pupils outside with clipboards. Observe:
- Where does water collect in the school grounds after rain? (run-off)
- Where does water soak into the ground? Grass vs. tarmac? (infiltration vs. run-off)
- Can you see any evidence of erosion? (worn paths, exposed soil)

Record observations on a simple tally chart. Back in class, connect observations to the water cycle diagram: "The puddle on the playground is run-off. The dry grass area is where infiltration happened. You just observed the water cycle in action."

### Follow-up fieldwork (separate session, linked to this cluster):

**River Trent local study (half-day trip):**

Visit a section of the River Trent accessible from school. Measure: river width, estimate depth, observe flow speed (floating orange peel), sketch the river channel cross-section, photograph river features (meander, bank erosion, deposition).

This connects to GeoStudy GS-GE-KS2-007 (Geographical Skills and Fieldwork), which also delivers `GE-KS2-C003` and has a cross-curricular link to **Data Handling with Spreadsheets** (ComputingTopicSuggestion) for processing the data back in school.

## 7. Resources and Materials Needed

| Resource | Purpose | Graph-informed? |
|---|---|---|
| Two photographs: River Trent at Nottingham + River Trent near source | Challenge problem hook | GeoPlace: River Thames (localised) |
| World map showing major rivers (A3, class display) | Context setting | GeoStudy rationale: "grounds abstract process understanding in real geographical contexts" |
| Water cycle process cards (6 per pair) | Drag-to-reorder activity | Concept GE-KS2-C003 key vocabulary |
| Simplified River Trent map (source to mouth, with tributaries labelled) | River tracing activity | GeoPlace reference node |
| River feature photograph cards (5 per set) | Matching pairs activity | Concept teaching guidance |
| Tilted sand tray + water jug | Erosion/transportation/deposition model | Concept teaching guidance: "Use diagrams and models" |
| Water cycle diagram (3 versions: pre-labelled, arrows-only, blank) | Differentiated activity | DifficultyLevel tiers DL1-DL3 |
| Word mat with key vocabulary | Desk reference | Concept key_vocabulary field |
| Exit ticket slips | I Notice / I Wonder plenary | Interaction type: pattern_discovery |
| Clipboards + tally charts (if fieldwork included) | School grounds observation | Fieldwork VehicleTemplate agent_prompt |

**Note:** The graph still does not provide or link to specific map resources, photograph sets, or data packs. However, the GeoStudy nodes and GeoPlace references now tell me *what specific places* to anchor resources around, which is a significant improvement. In V7 I had to decide which river to study, which places to compare, and which data to source entirely from my own knowledge. Now the graph says "River Thames" (which I localise to River Trent) and "UK Region vs European Region" (which tells me to prepare a European river comparison for extension). The specificity of the reference nodes transforms my resource sourcing from a blank page to a guided search.
