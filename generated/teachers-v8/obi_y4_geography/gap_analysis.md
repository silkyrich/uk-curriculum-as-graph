# Gap Analysis: KS2 Geography (Y4) — Mr. Obi (V8)

**Cluster reviewed:** `GE-KS2-D003-CL001` — Understand climate zones, biomes and the water cycle
**Date:** February 2026
**Previous score (V7):** 4.0/10 (lowest in entire review)
**This score (V8):** 7.5/10

---

## Overall Readiness Score: 7.5/10

This is a fundamentally different planning experience from V7. Three months ago I gave this cluster the lowest score in the entire teacher review — 4.0/10 — because Geography had zero ContentVehicles, zero DifficultyLevels, zero place references, and zero cross-curricular connections. I described the graph as providing a "curriculum skeleton" that told me *what to teach* but nothing about *with what*. I said Geography lessons generated from this graph would be "Geography talks, not Geography lessons."

That criticism no longer stands. The addition of GeoStudy nodes, GeoPlace and GeoContrast references, VehicleTemplate agent prompts, DifficultyLevel tiers, and 17 cross-curricular links has transformed this from a bare framework into something I can genuinely plan from. I still had to create physical resources (maps, photographs, data sets), but I no longer had to invent the pedagogical structure, the place anchors, the assessment criteria, or the cross-curricular connections. The graph told me *which river to study*, *which template to follow*, *which science topic connects*, and *what each difficulty tier looks like*. That is the difference between "start from scratch" and "start from a plan."

The 7.5 reflects real, substantial progress. It is not yet an 8 or a 9 because Geography remains more resource-dependent than other humanities subjects, and the graph still cannot provide or specify the visual and data resources that are the lifeblood of the subject. But for the first time, I could sit down with this context and have a lesson planned in under 30 minutes. In V7 it took me well over an hour, and most of that hour was inventing things the graph should have told me.

## NEW: GeoStudy Quality Assessment

### What was provided

Seven GeoStudy nodes delivering concepts in this cluster:

| GeoStudy | Status | Templates | Delivers |
|---|---|---|---|
| GS-GE-KS2-001 — UK Regional Study | mandatory | place_study | C002, C003 |
| GS-GE-KS2-002 — European Regional Study | mandatory | place_study | C002, C003 |
| GS-GE-KS2-003 — Americas Regional Study | mandatory | place_study | C002, C003 |
| GS-GE-KS2-004 — Rivers and the Water Cycle | mandatory | topic_study, fieldwork | C002, C003 |
| GS-GE-KS2-005 — Climate Zones, Biomes and Vegetation Belts | mandatory | topic_study | C002 |
| GS-GE-KS2-006 — Trade, Economic Geography and Fairtrade | convention | topic_study | C002 |
| GS-GE-KS2-007 — Geographical Skills and Fieldwork | mandatory | fieldwork | C003 |

### What worked well

1. **Coverage is comprehensive.** Every statutory KS2 Geography requirement is represented. The three regional studies (UK, European, Americas), the physical geography topics (rivers, climate/biomes), and the skills/fieldwork strand are all present. This matches what a well-planned Geography curriculum actually looks like.

2. **The DELIVERS_VIA relationships are accurate.** GS-GE-KS2-004 (Rivers and the Water Cycle) correctly delivers both C002 and C003. GS-GE-KS2-005 (Climate Zones) correctly delivers only C002. The many-to-many mapping between studies and concepts reflects real teaching practice — a rivers study does involve some climate zone understanding (river climates vary globally), and this is captured.

3. **The rationale text is genuinely useful.** The rationale for GS-GE-KS2-004 says: "Teaching through a specific river case study grounds abstract process understanding in real geographical contexts and enables pupils to trace how water shapes landscapes through erosion, transportation, and deposition." This is not boilerplate — it is a pedagogical argument that directly informed my lesson design. I chose this GeoStudy partly because its rationale matched my teaching philosophy.

4. **The template tags are pedagogically meaningful.** GS-GE-KS2-004 is tagged with both `topic_study` and `fieldwork`. This dual-template signal told me to combine classroom investigation with outdoor data collection. GS-GE-KS2-007 is tagged with `fieldwork` only, signalling it is primarily a skills-through-practice unit. These are not arbitrary labels — they encode real pedagogical decisions.

5. **The mandatory/convention distinction is helpful.** Six of seven are marked `mandatory` (statutory curriculum requirements). GS-GE-KS2-006 (Fairtrade) is marked `convention` — reflecting that it is the most common way schools deliver trade and economic activity content but is not the only valid approach. This distinction helps me prioritise.

### What was missing or weak

1. **No year group assignment.** Every GeoStudy shows `KS: None`. I need to know whether Rivers and the Water Cycle is best taught in Y3 or Y4. The curriculum says "KS2" but schools must decide which year. Most schools teach rivers in Y4 and climate zones in Y5, but there is no year-level guidance in the graph.

2. **No sequencing between GeoStudies.** History has `CHRONOLOGICALLY_FOLLOWS` relationships between HistoryStudy nodes. Geography has no equivalent sequencing. I need to know: should I teach the UK Regional Study before the European one? Should climate zones come before or after rivers? The graph gives me seven studies with no teaching order.

3. **No suggested duration or weighting.** A regional place study (GS-GE-KS2-001) typically runs 6-8 lessons. A focused topic study (GS-GE-KS2-005 on climate zones) might be 3-4 lessons. Fieldwork (GS-GE-KS2-007) is usually embedded, not standalone. None of this is in the graph.

### GeoStudy quality score: 7/10

A massive improvement from zero. The studies are well-chosen, accurately mapped to concepts, and pedagogically tagged. The missing year assignment and sequencing prevent them from supporting medium-term planning, but for individual lesson planning they are genuinely useful.

## NEW: GeoPlace / GeoContrast Quality Assessment

### What was provided

**GeoPlace nodes (7):** UK Region, European Region, Americas Region, River Thames, Global (x2), Local Fieldwork Area

**GeoContrast nodes (1):** UK Region vs European Region

### What worked well

1. **River Thames as an exemplar river.** Having a named river attached to GS-GE-KS2-004 signals that this study should be anchored in a real place. I localised to the River Trent, but the graph's specificity gave me permission and a model. In V7, the teaching guidance said "study a specific river" but there was no graph-level place reference — I was operating in a vacuum.

2. **UK Region vs European Region contrast.** This GeoContrast node directly supports the comparative analysis that is central to Geography. I used it to design the extension task (comparing River Trent with a European river system). The contrast structure tells me this is not just "learn about two places" but "compare two places systematically."

3. **The regional place nodes make sense geographically.** UK Region, European Region, Americas Region map to the three statutory regional studies. Global maps to the thematic studies (climate zones, trade). Local Fieldwork Area maps to the fieldwork strand. This is a clean, logical structure.

### What was missing or weak

1. **The place nodes are too generic.** "UK Region" is not a place — it is a category. The graph should say "Lake District" or "East Anglia" or "South Wales coast" and let schools choose their own. Similarly, "European Region" could be "Andalucia" or "the Alps" or "the Po Valley." The generic labels mean I still have to choose specific places myself.

2. **No place-specific data.** GeoPlace: River Thames has no coordinates, no length, no drainage basin area, no tributaries listed. A useful GeoPlace node for Geography would include: latitude/longitude, physical geography summary, climate data, population data, and key features. Currently it is just a label.

3. **Only one GeoContrast node for the entire cluster.** Geography is fundamentally a comparative discipline. I would expect contrasts for: UK river vs tropical river, temperate biome vs desert biome, urban river vs rural river. One contrast node is a start, not a solution.

4. **No photograph or image references.** GeoPlace nodes should link to (or describe) the key visual evidence for that place. "River Thames" should specify: photograph of source at Thames Head, photograph of meanders near Oxford, photograph of the Thames Barrier. Geography cannot be taught without images, and the graph still does not reference any.

### GeoPlace/GeoContrast quality score: 5/10

The structure is right. The concept is right. But the nodes are too thin — labels without data. They function as planning prompts ("remember to anchor this in a real place") rather than planning resources ("here is the place and its characteristics"). For me to score this higher, each GeoPlace needs physical and human geography summary data, and each cluster needs multiple GeoContrast pairs.

---

## NEW: VehicleTemplate Quality Assessment

### What was provided

Three VehicleTemplate nodes: `topic_study`, `place_study`, `fieldwork`. Each has a name, description, and agent_prompt.

### What worked well

1. **The agent prompts are directly usable.** The topic_study prompt ("open with an engaging hook that raises a question or challenge... introduce 2-3 sources... guide pupils toward forming their own interpretation") gave me a clear lesson arc that I followed almost exactly. This is the kind of pedagogical scaffolding that makes the difference between a lesson with good content and a lesson with good teaching.

2. **The fieldwork prompt includes safety.** "Prepare pupils for outdoor data collection with clear instructions and safety guidance" — this is a real-world requirement that teachers think about and curriculum documents often ignore. The prompt reminded me to plan for clipboards, tally charts, and structured recording before going outside.

3. **The templates are composable.** GS-GE-KS2-004 is tagged with both `topic_study` and `fieldwork`, telling me to combine the two templates. I used the topic_study structure for the overall lesson arc and integrated the fieldwork template into a specific phase. This dual-template approach is more useful than forcing every lesson into a single template.

### What was missing or weak

1. **The templates are subject-generic.** The topic_study prompt mentions "sources" — a concept borrowed from History. Geography's equivalent of a "source" is data, maps, photographs, or fieldwork observations, not historical documents. A Geography-specific topic_study template would say "introduce 2-3 data sources (climate data, maps, photographs) for pupils to analyse, prompting them to consider what the data shows and what it does not show."

2. **No template for "comparative place study."** Geography's most characteristic pedagogical structure is comparison: this place vs. that place, this time vs. that time, this scale vs. that scale. The `place_study` template describes studying a single place. A `comparative_study` template — "orient pupils in two places using maps, collect information about both, systematically compare physical and human features, and evaluate which factors explain the differences" — would be more geographically authentic.

3. **No age-banding on the templates.** The agent prompts are generic across KS1-KS4. A Y4 fieldwork template should specify simpler equipment (clipboards, tally charts) than a Y7 one (quadrats, anemometers, flow meters). The TEMPLATE_FOR relationship targets KeyStage, but the prompts do not differentiate within KS2.

### VehicleTemplate quality score: 7/10

The templates are a genuine planning aid. The agent prompts gave me lesson structure I could follow directly. The composability (dual-template tagging) is clever. The gap is subject-specificity — Geography needs its own vocabulary within these templates, and a comparative study template would be more valuable than a generic topic study.

---

## NEW: Cross-Curricular Links Assessment

### What was provided

17 CROSS_CURRICULAR relationships linking the 7 GeoStudy nodes to HistoryStudy, ScienceEnquiry, EnglishUnit, ArtTopicSuggestion, DTTopicSuggestion, and ComputingTopicSuggestion nodes. Each has a `hook` (text description) and `strength` (strong/moderate).

### What worked well

1. **The Science-Geography water cycle link exists and is marked "strong."** In V7 I wrote: "The most obvious cross-curricular link — Y4 Science states of matter to the water cycle — is not captured anywhere." It is now captured explicitly: `GS-GE-KS2-004 --> States of Matter and the Water Cycle (ScienceEnquiry) [strong]`, with the hook: "States of matter — evaporation, condensation, precipitation as phase changes." I used this directly in my lesson plan. This single link was the most requested addition in my V7 review, and it is exactly right.

2. **The hooks are specific and teachable.** "How the region has changed over time — industrial heritage, rural change" (GeoStudy UK Regional --> British History Beyond 1066) tells me precisely how to connect the two subjects. It is not a vague "links to History" — it tells me the historical lens is change over time and the geographical content is industrial heritage. I can plan a cross-curricular activity from this hook sentence alone.

3. **The strength ratings are calibrated correctly.** The three "strong" links (Americas --> Evolution/Adaptation, Rivers --> States of Matter, Climate Zones --> Evolution/Adaptation) are genuinely the three strongest cross-curricular connections in KS2 Geography. The "moderate" links (Rivers --> Poetry, Trade --> Bread Making) are real but weaker connections that might inform a theme week but would not drive lesson design. The rating system matches my professional judgement.

4. **The breadth of connections is impressive.** Links to History (3), Science (4), English (4), Art (2), DT (1), Computing (1) — this covers all the subjects I would naturally connect Geography to. The Computing link (Fieldwork --> Data Handling with Spreadsheets) is particularly welcome because it gives me a concrete reason to use spreadsheets in Geography, which supports the computing curriculum simultaneously.

5. **The relationships are directional and specific.** Each link goes from a specific GeoStudy to a specific study/enquiry/unit in another subject. This is far more useful than a generic "Geography links to Science" — it tells me which Geography topic links to which Science topic, and how.

### What was missing or weak

1. **No Maths cross-curricular links.** Geography at KS2 involves significant data handling (plotting climate data, calculating temperature ranges, reading scales on maps). The obvious link — Geography data enquiry to Maths statistics/data handling — is absent from the 17 connections. This was in my V7 "top 5 data additions" list and is still missing.

2. **No link from climate zones to PSHE / Citizenship.** Climate change is the most politically and personally relevant topic in KS2 Geography. A link from Climate Zones to a Citizenship or PSHE topic on environmental responsibility would be pedagogically valuable and reflects current teaching practice.

3. **Some hooks could be more specific.** "European art and architecture traditions from the studied region" (European Regional Study --> Gaudi Architecture) is vague — it only works if you study Barcelona. A more useful hook would name the artistic connection at a more general level or offer alternatives.

### Cross-curricular links quality score: 8/10

This is the strongest of the four new additions. The links are specific, accurately strength-rated, and directly usable in planning. The missing Maths link is a notable gap, but the 17 connections that exist represent a genuine curriculum web rather than a list of vague associations. In V7 I had to invent every cross-curricular connection. Now I could plan an entire half-term's cross-curricular enrichment from these links alone.

## Comparison to V7: What Has Changed

### The devastating V7 verdict (verbatim from my review):

> "Geography is the least well-served subject I reviewed in the graph... the graph provides almost none of the *with what* that makes a Geography lesson teachable."

> "Geography has nothing. This is the biggest structural gap."

> "Geography without maps is not geography."

> "A lesson on climate zones without a world map, a lesson on rivers without OS map extracts, a lesson on regional comparison without data from real places — these are not Geography lessons. They are Geography talks."

### What has been addressed

| V7 Gap | V8 Status | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Zero ContentVehicles for Geography | 7 GeoStudy nodes with rationales, concept mappings, and template tags | **Transformative.** I now know which studies to teach, why, and how they deliver concepts. |
| No DifficultyLevel nodes | Full DL tiers for both concepts (entry/developing/expected/greater_depth with example tasks) | **Transformative.** Success criteria, differentiation, and assessment are now graph-generated, not teacher-invented. |
| No cross-subject connections | 17 CROSS_CURRICULAR links with hooks and strength ratings | **Transformative.** The Science-Geography water cycle link alone was my top request. |
| No place-specific knowledge | 7 GeoPlace nodes + 1 GeoContrast node | **Significant but incomplete.** Place anchors exist but lack data. |
| No pedagogical templates | 3 VehicleTemplates with agent prompts | **Significant.** The topic_study and fieldwork prompts directly shaped my lesson structure. |
| No map resources | Still absent | **Not addressed.** |
| No real-world data | Still absent | **Not addressed.** |
| No fieldwork scaffolds | Fieldwork VehicleTemplate + GeoStudy GS-GE-KS2-007 | **Partially addressed.** Template provides pedagogical guidance but not equipment lists or data sheets. |
| No photograph/visual references | Still absent | **Not addressed.** |
| No estimated teaching time | Still shows "None lessons (~None weeks)" | **Not addressed.** |
| No child-friendly vocabulary definitions | Still absent | **Not addressed.** |

### The shift in planning experience

In V7, I sat down with the graph context and essentially had to build a lesson from concept descriptions and interaction types. The graph told me to teach "Climate Zones and Biomes" and "River Systems and the Water Cycle" but gave me no studies to anchor the teaching, no places to ground it, no difficulty progression to differentiate by, and no cross-curricular connections to enrich it. I spent over an hour on what should have been a 30-minute planning task, and most of that time was inventing structure the graph should have provided.

In V8, the GeoStudy nodes gave me a menu of teaching vehicles. I chose GS-GE-KS2-004 (Rivers and the Water Cycle) because its rationale matched my teaching approach and its dual-template tag (topic_study + fieldwork) matched my lesson structure. The DifficultyLevel tiers gave me four-band success criteria and assessment descriptors. The cross-curricular links gave me the Science connection I had been requesting. The VehicleTemplate agent prompts gave me a lesson arc. I planned the lesson in about 25 minutes, and most of that time was designing specific activities — not inventing the pedagogical framework.

That is the difference between 4.0/10 and 7.5/10.

---

## What Was Sufficient (Used Directly from Graph)

1. **DifficultyLevel tiers** — All four bands for both concepts, with example tasks and example responses. Used directly as success criteria and differentiation bands. This was the single highest-leverage addition.

2. **GeoStudy rationales** — The rationale for GS-GE-KS2-004 directly informed my choice of teaching vehicle and lesson angle. Not just a label — a pedagogical argument.

3. **Cross-curricular hooks** — The Rivers --> States of Matter [strong] link with its hook text was used directly in the lesson plan. The strength rating told me this was a primary connection, not a tangential one.

4. **VehicleTemplate agent prompts** — The topic_study prompt gave me a lesson arc; the fieldwork prompt gave me practical guidance for outdoor learning. Both used near-verbatim.

5. **ThinkingLens integration** — Systems and System Models remains an excellent lens for the water cycle. The question stems were used directly in multiple lesson phases.

6. **Concept misconceptions** — Specific, accurate, and directly teachable. Used to design distractor options in MCQ activities and to plan explicit misconception correction.

7. **Prerequisite chains** — Clear and useful for designing the starter activity.

---

## What Was Missing (Had to Invent)

1. **All physical and digital resources.** Maps, photographs, data cards, sand trays, word mats — every tangible resource was teacher-sourced. The graph still cannot specify, link to, or describe the visual and data resources that Geography requires.

2. **Child-friendly vocabulary definitions.** The graph provides term lists but not age-appropriate definitions. I wrote 16 definitions to match the Y4 content guidelines. This is a repeated gap across all reviews.

3. **Year group assignment for GeoStudy nodes.** All show `KS: None`. I had to decide that Rivers and the Water Cycle is a Y4 topic based on my school's curriculum map, not graph data.

4. **Teaching sequence across the seven GeoStudy nodes.** No sequencing relationships. I had to decide from professional knowledge that rivers should be taught before climate zones in my school's Y4 programme.

5. **Estimated teaching time.** Still "None lessons (~None weeks)." I had to judge that this cluster suits a 4-5 lesson sequence with one lesson focused on rivers (this plan) and subsequent lessons on climate zones and biomes.

6. **Place-specific data.** GeoPlace: River Thames is a label, not a data source. I needed coordinates, length, tributaries, drainage basin area. For the River Trent (my local equivalent) I sourced all of this myself.

7. **Specific photograph descriptions.** The teaching guidance says "use photographs to study river landforms." I need to know *which* photographs — an aerial view of meanders, a close-up of bank erosion, a photograph of flood damage. The graph does not describe or reference specific visual evidence.

---

## Remaining Gaps: What Would Take This to 9/10

### 1. GeoPlace data enrichment (would add +0.5)
Each GeoPlace node needs: coordinates, physical geography summary (relief, climate, key features), human geography summary (population, land use, economy), and key statistics. "River Thames" should tell me it is 346 km long, rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, flows through Oxford and London, and has a drainage basin of 12,935 km2. Without this, the place nodes are prompts rather than resources.

### 2. Geography-specific VehicleTemplate variants (would add +0.25)
A `comparative_study` template for the characteristic geographical pedagogy of comparing two places. The current `topic_study` template is History-flavoured ("sources" language). Geography needs: "introduce two places using maps and data, compare physical and human features systematically, and evaluate which factors explain the differences."

### 3. Year-group assignment for GeoStudy nodes (would add +0.25)
`KS: None` on all 7 nodes. Needs to be `Y3`, `Y4`, `Y5`, or `Y6` to enable medium-term planning. Most schools teach UK regional in Y3, rivers + regional European in Y4, climate zones + Americas in Y5, and trade + skills consolidation in Y6.

### 4. GeoStudy sequencing relationships (would add +0.25)
History has CHRONOLOGICALLY_FOLLOWS. Geography needs TEACHES_BEFORE or a similar ordering relationship: UK Regional Study --> European Regional Study --> Americas Regional Study (expanding geographical horizons). Rivers and Water Cycle --> Climate Zones and Biomes (physical processes before global patterns).

### 5. Maths cross-curricular link (would add +0.25)
Geography data handling --> Maths statistics/data handling. This was in my V7 top 5 and is still absent from the 17 cross-curricular links. It is the most commonly taught cross-curricular connection in KS2 Geography.

### 6. Child-friendly vocabulary definitions on Concept nodes (would add +0.25)
A `vocabulary_definitions` property (or linked VocabularyTerm nodes) with definitions at Lexile 300-500L. This has been requested in every review since V5.

### 7. Photograph / visual evidence descriptions (would add +0.25)
Each GeoStudy should list the key visual evidence pupils need to see: "aerial photograph of river meanders," "close-up photograph of glacial erosion," "satellite image showing deforestation boundary." The graph cannot generate images, but it can specify what images are needed — which would allow a platform to source or generate them.

**Total potential with these additions: ~9.0/10**

The remaining 1.0 point would require actual resource generation capabilities (interactive maps, data visualisations, auto-generated worksheets) which are platform features rather than graph data.

## Summary Scores

| Category | V7 Score | V8 Score | Change |

## Final Verdict

In V7 I wrote: "A lesson on rivers without OS map extracts, a lesson on regional comparison without data from real places — these are not Geography lessons. They are Geography talks."

V8 has not given me the OS map extracts or the real data. But it has given me something I did not have before: a complete pedagogical scaffold that tells me which study to teach, how to structure it, what difficulty looks like at each level, and which other subjects connect. The geography-specific resources remain teacher-sourced, but the planning intelligence is now graph-sourced. The balance has shifted from 80% teacher invention / 20% graph scaffolding to roughly 40% teacher creation / 60% graph scaffolding.

Geography is no longer the least well-served subject in the graph. The GeoStudy nodes, DifficultyLevel tiers, and cross-curricular links have closed the gap with History and Science. The remaining distance to 9/10 is about data richness (place-specific content, visual evidence descriptions, Maths links) rather than structural absence.

This is what +3.5 points feels like: the difference between starting from a blank page and starting from a plan.
