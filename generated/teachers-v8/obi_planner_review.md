## Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. Header and Metadata

The header is well-structured and contains most of what I need. Subject (Geography), Key Stage (KS2), statutory reference, estimated duration (8 lessons), study type (Thematic Study), and status (Mandatory) are all present. The statutory reference — "NC KS2 Geography: 'describe and understand key aspects of physical geography, including: rivers, mountains, volcanoes and earthquakes, and the water cycle'" — is correctly pulled from the programme of study and immediately tells me the curriculum anchor.

The estimated duration of 8 lessons is a significant improvement over V7, where all ConceptCluster nodes showed "None lessons." Eight lessons for a rivers unit is reasonable — I would plan 6-8 depending on whether fieldwork is included. This is basic but useful metadata.

One error: the source document says "KS2 English Grammar, Punctuation and Spelling Test Framework 2016." This is completely wrong for a Geography planner. The source document should reference the Geography Programme of Study (2014). This appears to be a persistent generator error that appears across all subjects.

No year group is specified in the header — it says "Key Stage: KS2" but not which year within KS2. Rivers is typically taught in Y4 or Y5. For a teacher planning, the year group determines the learner profile, vocabulary expectations, and cross-curricular links. This is a meaningful omission.

**Rating:** Good structure. Estimated duration is a welcome addition. Source document error and missing year group undermine confidence.

### 2. Enquiry Questions

The planner includes one enquiry question: "How does water shape the landscape?" This is appropriate, geographically rich, and would drive a genuine enquiry sequence. It is the kind of question the Geographical Association recommends as a unit driver.

However, a single question is thin for an 8-lesson unit. A strong Geography unit typically has 3-5 sub-questions that build towards the overarching question. For this unit, I would expect:

1. How does water shape the landscape? (overarching)
2. What is the water cycle and why does it matter?
3. How does a river change from source to mouth?
4. What landforms do rivers create?
5. How do people use and manage rivers?

The planner gives me the umbrella but not the progression. Still, having any enquiry question at all is an improvement over V7, which had none.

**Rating:** Good starting point. One question is better than none but insufficient for an 8-lesson unit.

### 3. Concept Quality and Differentiation

The primary concept — "River Systems and the Water Cycle" (GE-KS2-C003) — is excellent. The description is geographically rich and accurate: it covers the river system (source to mouth, tributaries, drainage basin), river processes (erosion, transportation, deposition), river landforms (valleys, meanders, ox-bow lakes, deltas, floodplains), and the water cycle (evaporation, condensation, precipitation, run-off, infiltration). This is comprehensive and correctly scoped for KS2.

The teaching guidance is practical and detailed: "Use diagrams and models to explain the water cycle... Study a specific river system in detail: trace it from source to mouth on a map, identify key tributaries and settlements, study the features at different stages... Investigate local rivers or streams through fieldwork." This tells me not just what to teach but how to teach it. The mention of fieldwork is important — it signals that the graph understands Geography as a fieldwork-based subject.

The common misconceptions are the strongest part of this section:

- "Pupils often think rivers flow uphill at some point" — the single most common river misconception in KS2
- "The water cycle is often presented too simplistically" — correctly identifies the gap between the standard diagram and the actual complexity
- "Pupils may not connect rivers to the water cycle" — an integration error I see every year

These are not generic warnings — they are specific, accurate, and immediately actionable.

The **differentiation table** for the primary concept is a major improvement over V7:

- **Entry:** Labelling a simple water cycle diagram — appropriate, concrete, achievable
- **Developing:** Describing the water cycle as continuous and identifying river features — the conceptual step up from labelling to explaining
- **Expected:** Explaining erosion, transportation, and deposition and identifying specific landforms — matches the NC requirement
- **Greater depth:** Evaluating human interaction with rivers — genuine higher-order thinking

The example tasks are specific enough to use. "How does a river create a meander?" at Expected level is a question I could pose to a class. "Rivers provide benefits but also pose risks. Explain how people manage this balance" at Greater Depth is a genuine geographical analysis task.

The common errors at each level are useful: "Confusing erosion with deposition" at Expected is the exact error I see when children first encounter these terms. "Not recognising that human actions upstream can cause problems downstream" at Greater Depth identifies the systems thinking that distinguishes secure from deep understanding.

**Three secondary concepts** are included: Latitude, Longitude and the Global Grid (GE-KS2-C001), Climate Zones and Biomes (GE-KS2-C002), and Ordnance Survey Maps and Grid References (GE-KS2-C005). Each has its own differentiation table. This is impressive — in V7, Geography concepts had no differentiation data at all.

The secondary concept selection is sensible. OS maps (C005) supports the practical map skills needed for river study. Latitude and longitude (C001) contextualises where rivers are located globally. Climate zones (C002) connects rainfall patterns to river flow — though this is a secondary rather than direct connection. I would have preferred to see "Settlement and Economic Geography" (GE-KS2-C004) as a secondary concept, since rivers and settlement are intimately linked, but I understand the graph may sequence that differently.

**Rating:** Excellent. The differentiation tables for ALL four concepts are a step change from V7's zero differentiation data. This is the section that justifies the score increase.

### 4. Subject-Specific Content

The "Study scope" section is new and Geography-specific. It includes:

- **Scale:** Regional — correct for a UK rivers study
- **Themes:** River processes, water cycle, erosion and deposition, landscape formation — comprehensive
- **Map types:** River basin map, OS map, cross section, satellite image — exactly the map types I would use
- **Data sources:** Environment Agency, Ordnance Survey, Met Office rainfall data, Google Earth — real, accessible, authoritative sources
- **Fieldwork potential:** "Local river or stream study measuring width, depth, and flow velocity at different points; observing erosion and deposition features; water quality testing" — specific and practical
- **Assessment guidance:** Three assessment questions covering water cycle vocabulary, source-to-mouth changes, and landform formation — directly testable

This section did not exist in V7. It represents the per-subject ontology (GeoStudy) providing Geography-specific metadata that the generic ConceptCluster context could not. This is exactly what I argued for in V7: subject-specific properties on Geography nodes.

The map types list is particularly valuable. "River basin map, OS map, cross section, satellite image" tells me what resources to prepare. It does not provide the actual maps — but naming the types is a meaningful step from V7's complete silence on resources.

The data sources (Environment Agency, Ordnance Survey, Met Office, Google Earth) are all real and accessible. The Met Office rainfall data and Environment Agency flood maps are what I actually use when teaching rivers. The generator knows WHERE the data comes from, even though it does not include the data itself.

The fieldwork potential description is specific enough to act on. "Measuring width, depth, and flow velocity at different points" describes a standard river study fieldwork activity that I could plan from. This is a far cry from V7's generic "fieldwork skills" link.

**Rating:** Strong. The Geography-specific study scope is the biggest structural improvement from V7.

### 5. Thinking Lenses

There is no explicit thinking lens section. In V7, the cluster context provided "Systems and System Models" as the recommended lens with question stems: "What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?" This lens was excellent for the water cycle — I used it directly in my V7 lesson plan.

The enquiry question ("How does water shape the landscape?") partially compensates, but it is not the same as having a named cognitive lens with structured question stems. The Systems lens brought genuine analytical depth to V7 — asking "If precipitation doubled, what would happen to rivers?" pushed children beyond description to prediction and reasoning.

**Rating:** Missing. A regression from V7.

### 6. Session Structure / Vehicle Templates

There is no session structure or lesson breakdown. The planner estimates 8 lessons but does not sequence them. For an 8-lesson rivers unit, I would expect at minimum:

- Lessons 1-2: Water cycle (diagram, processes, connections to observable phenomena)
- Lessons 3-4: River systems (source to mouth, tributaries, drainage basin)
- Lessons 5-6: River landforms (erosion, deposition, meanders, floodplains)
- Lesson 7: Fieldwork (local river study) or Human interaction with rivers
- Lesson 8: Assessment and review

The planner's assessment guidance hints at this structure ("Can pupils explain the water cycle? Can they describe source to mouth? Can they explain landforms?") but does not formalise it.

No VehicleTemplate data appears in this planner. The graph has 24 VehicleTemplate nodes with TEMPLATE_FOR relationships to KeyStage. If a "Thematic Study" template exists for KS2, its pedagogical guidance (enquiry cycle, fieldwork integration, data analysis) should be surfaced here.

**Rating:** Missing. The 8-lesson duration is provided but the content of those 8 lessons is not.

### 7. Cross-Curricular Opportunities

The cross-curricular table lists three links:

1. **Stone Age to Iron Age Britain** — "Historical importance of rivers for settlement, trade, and industry" (Moderate)
2. **States of Matter and the Water Cycle** — "States of matter — evaporation, condensation, precipitation as phase changes" (Strong)
3. **Poetry: Shape Poems and Calligrams** — "River poetry and descriptive writing" (Moderate)

This is a significant improvement over V7, where cross-curricular links for Geography were either absent or broken. The Science-Geography link (states of matter and the water cycle) is the single most important cross-curricular connection for this unit, and it is correctly identified as "Strong." In V7, I specifically flagged this link as missing — "The most obvious cross-curricular link — Y4 Science states of matter and the water cycle — is not captured anywhere." Its presence here means the per-subject ontology's CROSS_CURRICULAR relationships are working.

However, the "Subject" column says "None" for all three entries. The links themselves are correctly described, but the subject field is not populated. "States of Matter and the Water Cycle" should show "Science" in the Subject column. This is the same data quality error Mr. Kowalski flagged.

The History link (Stone Age settlement near rivers) and English link (river poetry) are both valid and commonly used in primary schools. I would also expect a Maths link — data handling (plotting rainfall data, measuring river features) is a natural cross-curricular connection. And a PSHE/Citizenship link around flood risk management and environmental responsibility would strengthen the unit.

**Rating:** Good improvement from V7. The Science-Geography link is present and correct. Subject field bug needs fixing.

### 8. Sequencing

The planner states "Follows: Hot and Cold Places: Seasonal and Daily Weather Patterns." This is a sensible prerequisite — understanding weather and climate patterns before studying the water cycle. There is no "Leads to" entry, so I do not know what unit comes after rivers.

Compared to V7, where the cluster SEQUENCED_AFTER chain provided within-domain progression (CL001 -> CL002 -> CL003), this planner shows between-unit progression (weather -> rivers). This is more useful for medium-term planning — it tells me where this unit sits in the KS2 Geography curriculum.

**Rating:** Adequate. Having the predecessor unit is more useful than V7's cluster chain.

### 9. Pitfalls, Sensitive Content, Success Criteria

The three pitfalls are well-chosen:

1. "Teaching the water cycle as a closed diagram without connecting it to real rivers and rainfall pupils can observe" — this is the most common error in water cycle teaching. The standard poster diagram (arrows going in a circle) gives children a false mental model. Connecting it to rain they can see falling and rivers they can visit is essential.
2. "Presenting rivers as flowing in only one direction without explaining why (gravity and gradient)" — addresses the "rivers flow uphill" misconception directly.
3. "Neglecting human interaction with rivers — flooding, water supply, settlement, and pollution" — pushes the unit beyond physical geography into human geography, which the NC requires.

The **success criteria** section is new and useful:

- Draw and label the water cycle with correct vocabulary
- Describe how a river changes from source to mouth
- Explain at least 2 river landforms (meander, flood plain, oxbow lake)
- Use a river basin map to identify source, mouth, and tributaries

These are clear, assessable statements. I could use them as lesson objectives, write them on the board, or give them to children as a self-assessment checklist. The specificity ("at least 2 river landforms") sets a clear threshold. The inclusion of map skills ("Use a river basin map") reflects the practical nature of Geography.

There is no sensitive content section. Rivers and the water cycle are not typically sensitive topics, though flooding can be distressing for children who have experienced it (Nottingham itself has a significant flood history along the River Trent). A brief note about sensitivity when discussing flood damage and loss would be thoughtful.

**Rating:** Strong. Pitfalls and success criteria are both useful and specific.

### 10. Vocabulary

The word mat lists 13 terms: river, source, mouth, tributary, drainage basin, meander, flood plain, erosion, deposition, water cycle, evaporation, condensation, precipitation. No definitions are provided.

This is a comprehensive list of the key geographical vocabulary for a rivers unit. The terms are correctly prioritised — these are the 13 words that every child should know by the end of the unit. I particularly note the inclusion of "drainage basin," which is often overlooked but is a key concept for understanding river systems as systems.

Missing: **infiltration** (listed in the concept description but not on the word mat), **run-off** (similarly listed in the concept but absent from the mat), **gradient** and **cross-section** (important for understanding why rivers flow and how they change). The concept description includes all of these as key vocabulary, but the word mat does not.

The empty definitions column is the same gap as the English planners. For Geography, definitions need to be both geographically precise and child-accessible. "Meander" cannot be defined as "a bend in a river" — it must specify that it is formed by erosion on the outer bank and deposition on the inner bank. But it also cannot use language above KS2 reading level. This balance is difficult and the graph should provide it.

**Rating:** Good term selection (13 is about right for a KS2 unit) but incomplete compared to the concept description, and empty definitions are a persistent gap.

## What I Could Teach From This Planner (Without External Resources)

1. I could plan an 8-lesson unit with a clear curriculum focus on river systems and the water cycle.
2. I could set differentiated objectives at four levels for all four concepts — this is transformative compared to V7.
3. I could anticipate and address common misconceptions (rivers flowing uphill, water cycle as simple loop, deserts always hot).
4. I could identify the map types and data sources I need to prepare.
5. I could plan fieldwork with a clear focus (measuring width, depth, flow velocity).
6. I could assess against the four success criteria.
7. I could frame the unit with the enquiry question "How does water shape the landscape?"
8. I could plan cross-curricular links with Science (states of matter), History (settlement), and English (river poetry).
9. I could avoid the three pitfalls — particularly teaching the water cycle as a closed diagram.
10. I could sequence this unit after the weather/climate unit.

## What I Would Still Need to Create Myself

1. **Maps.** The planner lists "river basin map, OS map, cross section, satellite image" but provides none. I need to source a River Thames basin map, a local OS map extract (River Trent near our school), cross-section diagrams, and a Google Earth satellite view. This takes 1-2 hours.
2. **Climate and rainfall data.** The data sources (Environment Agency, Met Office) are named but no actual data is provided. I need to find and format monthly rainfall data for the river study.
3. **Vocabulary definitions.** 13 terms need child-friendly definitions and visual support (diagrams of meander formation, cross-section of a floodplain, labelled water cycle diagram).
4. **Lesson-by-lesson breakdown.** The 8-lesson estimate needs to be sequenced: which lessons cover the water cycle, which cover river features, which include fieldwork?
5. **Fieldwork plan.** The fieldwork potential is described but I need a risk assessment, equipment list, data collection sheet, and parent letter.
6. **Thinking lens framing.** The "Systems" lens from V7 was excellent for this unit. I would add it myself.
7. **Photographs.** Biome and river landform photographs for display and discussion. The planner mentions no visual resources.
8. **Assessment rubric.** The success criteria are useful but I need a rubric showing what entry/developing/expected/greater depth responses look like for each criterion. The differentiation tables help here, but they need translating into a marking format.
9. **Location information.** The "Locations" section lists "River Thames" with no description. I need case study material for the Thames and ideally a comparison with a contrasting river (Amazon, Nile, Ganges).
10. **Knowledge organiser.** A single-page summary for children's books and the working wall.

## Comparison to V7

### What has improved:

1. **DifficultyLevel differentiation for ALL four concepts.** In V7, Geography had zero DifficultyLevel data. Now, the primary concept and all three secondary concepts have full entry/developing/expected/greater depth tables with example tasks and common errors. This is the single biggest improvement and directly addresses my V7 complaint.
2. **Geography-specific study scope.** Map types, data sources, fieldwork potential, and assessment guidance are all new. The per-subject ontology (GeoStudy) provides metadata that the generic ConceptCluster could not. This is exactly what I requested in V7.
3. **Enquiry question.** V7 had no enquiry question. Having "How does water shape the landscape?" gives the unit a geographical purpose.
4. **Cross-curricular links present and correct.** The Science-Geography water cycle link that I specifically flagged as missing in V7 is now present. Three links total, all valid.
5. **Success criteria.** Four clear, assessable statements. V7 had no success criteria.
6. **Estimated duration.** 8 lessons. V7 showed "None lessons."
7. **Named data sources.** Environment Agency, Ordnance Survey, Met Office, Google Earth. V7 had no data source references.
8. **Pitfalls.** Three practical, Geography-specific warnings. V7 had none.
9. **Location listed (even if minimal).** River Thames is named. V7 had no place-specific content.

### What has regressed:

1. **No thinking lens.** V7 had "Systems and System Models" with directly usable question stems. This planner has none. The Systems lens was the most valuable pedagogical addition in V7.
2. **No learner profile data.** V7 referenced the pedagogy sequence, scaffolding level, interaction types, and feedback guidance. This planner has none.
3. **No session structure.** V7 had the 5-phase pedagogy sequence adapted to a 60-minute lesson. This planner has 8 lessons with no content.

### What remains the same:

1. **No actual maps, data, or photographs.** Named data sources are an improvement, but the planner still cannot provide the resources themselves.
2. **No vocabulary definitions.**
3. **No fieldwork plan (risk assessment, equipment, data collection sheet).**
4. **Location data is minimal** — "River Thames" with no description, no case study material, no comparison location.

### Net assessment:

This is a substantially better planner than V7's cluster context for Geography. The per-subject ontology (GeoStudy) delivers what the generic ConceptCluster could not: map types, data sources, fieldwork potential, enquiry questions, cross-curricular links, and assessment guidance. The DifficultyLevel differentiation across all four concepts is transformative. The success criteria and pitfalls are new and useful.

The Geography-specific resource gap remains. Maps, data, photographs, and fieldwork plans are still not provided. But the planner now NAMES the resource types and data sources I need, which is a meaningful step from V7's complete silence. The difference is: V7 told me what to teach but gave me no idea how to teach it. V8 tells me what to teach, lists the resources I need, describes the fieldwork I should do, and gives me assessment criteria. I still need to source the resources myself, but I know what to look for.

## Score: 6.5 / 10

**Justification:** Up from 4.0 in V7. The DifficultyLevel differentiation across all concepts (+1.0), Geography-specific study scope (+0.5), enquiry question (+0.25), cross-curricular links (+0.25), success criteria (+0.25), estimated duration (+0.25), and pitfalls (+0.25) represent a 2.5-point improvement before offsets. Loss of thinking lens and learner profile (-0.25). Net improvement: +2.5. The remaining gap to 8-9/10 requires actual map and data resources, vocabulary definitions, lesson-by-lesson sequencing, and fieldwork planning scaffolds — the subject-specific resources that make Geography lessons teachable rather than just plannable.
