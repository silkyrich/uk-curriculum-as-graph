## Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. Header and Metadata

The header gets the basics right -- subject, key stage, year group range (Y3, Y4), estimated duration (5 lessons). The study type "Artist Study" is clear and correctly categorises this as Lowry-focused work.

Two problems stood out immediately. First, the source document is listed as "KS2 English Grammar, Punctuation and Spelling Test Framework 2016." This is obviously wrong -- an Art planner citing an English GPS test framework is a metadata error that would undermine teacher confidence. The correct source should reference the KS2 Art and Design Programme of Study. This looks like a data join bug in the auto-generator, not a content problem, but it needs fixing.

Second, the statutory reference ("about great artists, architects and designers in history") is accurate but vague. For a primary generalist who may not know the Art curriculum well, I would want to see this anchored to the specific programme of study statement so I know exactly what statutory requirement I am meeting.

The "Status: Convention" label is not explained anywhere. I do not know what "Convention" means in this context -- is this a mandatory study? A recommended exemplar? A teacher-editable suggestion? The V8 Geography planner uses "Exemplar," which is clearer.

### 2. Enquiry Questions

There are no enquiry questions in this planner. The Geography planner has "Can we ever be truly prepared for tectonic hazards?" which gives a clear investigative thread. Art benefits enormously from a driving question -- something like "Why did Lowry paint ordinary people and places?" or "How can we use Lowry's techniques to tell stories about where we live?" would give the 5-lesson sequence a purpose beyond "study Lowry and make some art."

For a non-specialist primary teacher, the absence of an enquiry question means there is no narrative to hang the lessons on. I would need to invent one myself.

### 3. Concept Quality and Differentiation

This is the strongest section of the planner. Three concepts are clearly identified with distinct roles: one primary (Art History) and two secondary (Drawing Mastery, Painting Mastery). Each has a differentiation table with Entry/Developing/Expected levels.

The primary concept description (AD-KS2-C005) is detailed and includes teaching guidance that is genuinely useful: "Include both canonical and less well-known examples, and deliberately include non-Western and contemporary practitioners." As a primary generalist, this tells me something I might not have thought of -- that my Lowry study should be contextualised within a broader programme that includes diverse artists, not presented as if Lowry is the only artist worth studying.

The differentiation tables are a real strength. For Drawing Mastery, the progression from "drawing from observation with some attention to proportion" (Entry) to "creating observational drawings that demonstrate control of line, tone, proportion and texture" (Expected) gives me clear assessment criteria. The common errors column is practical -- "starting with small details instead of the overall shape" is exactly what Y3 children do when trying to draw Lowry's industrial buildings.

However, the example tasks are inconsistent across the three concepts. The primary concept (Art History) has full example tasks at each level, but the secondary concepts (Drawing and Painting) only have "What success looks like" and "Common errors" without explicit tasks. This asymmetry means I can assess Art History knowledge but I would need to design my own practical assessment tasks for Drawing and Painting.

The misconceptions on the Art History concept are thoughtful: "Pupils may see art history as a list of names and dates" and "The division between fine art, craft and design can create a false hierarchy." These are genuinely useful for framing how I introduce Lowry.

### 4. Subject-Specific Content

The "Art focus" section is the most practically useful part of the planner. It tells me:

- Artist: L.S. Lowry (1887-1976)
- Art movement: British Realism
- Medium: paint
- Techniques: colour mixing (muted tones), perspective drawing, figure drawing, compositional planning
- Visual elements: colour, space, form, tone
- Cultural context: British

This is a solid foundation. I know the medium, the techniques to teach, and the visual elements to focus on. For a non-specialist, this is a curriculum in miniature -- it tells me what skills to develop through this particular artist.

What is missing is any practical instruction for how to teach these techniques. "Colour mixing (muted tones)" tells me what to teach but not how. What specific colours do I mix to get Lowry's characteristic grey-blues and browns? What is the base palette? Do I start with white and add colour, or start with colour and mute it? A primary generalist who is not confident with paint mixing would be stuck here.

Similarly, "perspective drawing" appears in the techniques list but there is no guidance on how to teach perspective to Y3-Y4 children. Perspective is genuinely difficult at this age -- most Y3 children cannot draw in single-point perspective. The planner should indicate what level of perspective is expected (simple overlapping? Foreground/background size difference? Horizon lines?) and provide a teaching sequence.

### 5. Thinking Lenses

There are no thinking lenses in this planner. My V8 Maths review had "Scale, Proportion and Quantity" with specific question stems and age-banded prompts from the graph. My V7 Maths review had ThinkingLens connections with ranked lenses and rationales.

For Art, a thinking lens like "Perspective and Interpretation" would be natural: "What was the artist trying to communicate? How does context shape what we see?" The graph has 10 thinking lenses and applies them to ConceptClusters -- but this planner draws from the per-subject ontology (ArtTopicSuggestion), and it appears the ThinkingLens integration has not been connected to the ontology layer.

This is a significant gap. The thinking lens is one of the strongest features of the graph data and its absence here is felt.

### 6. Session Structure / Vehicle Templates

There is no session structure, lesson sequence, or vehicle template in this planner. For a 5-lesson study, I would expect at minimum:

- Lesson 1: Introduce Lowry -- who was he, when/where did he work, what did he paint and why?
- Lesson 2: Observational drawing of Lowry's figures -- study his elongated matchstick people
- Lesson 3: Colour mixing workshop -- creating Lowry's muted palette
- Lesson 4: Composition -- planning and sketching an industrial landscape
- Lesson 5: Final piece -- painting an industrial scene in the style of Lowry

The graph has 24 VehicleTemplate nodes with age-banded pedagogical prompts. An Art KS2 vehicle template should exist that provides a generic artist study structure (context lesson, skills lesson, experiment lesson, develop lesson, final piece). If that template were surfaced here, a non-specialist teacher would have a complete lesson sequence.

Without this, the planner gives me content knowledge (what to teach about Lowry) but no pedagogical structure (how to sequence 5 lessons). I would need to create the full lesson-by-lesson plan myself.

### 7. Cross-Curricular Opportunities

Two cross-curricular links are listed: British History Beyond 1066 (Industrial Revolution, social conditions) and UK Regional Study (Northern England, industrial cities). Both are valid and well-chosen -- Lowry is inherently a cross-curricular figure connecting Art with History and Geography.

However, the "Subject" column shows "None" for both links. This appears to be a data quality issue -- the auto-generator should be resolving these to History and Geography respectively. A teacher scanning this table would find "None" confusing.

The strength of the connections is listed as "Moderate" for both. No explanation is given for what "Moderate" means or how it differs from "Strong" or "Weak." Without guidance, this label adds nothing.

Missing cross-curricular links that a primary teacher would find useful:
- English: descriptive writing about industrial scenes, poetry about working life
- PSHE: comparing living and working conditions then and now, social inequality
- Music: industrial sounds, comparing urban and rural soundscapes

### 8. Sequencing

There is no sequencing information in this planner. The Geography planner has "Follows: Haiti 2010 Earthquake" which tells the teacher where this unit sits in a scheme of work. For Art, I would expect sequencing like "Follows: Y3 Autumn -- Drawing skills unit" or "Precedes: Y4 Spring -- Sculpture (Hepworth)." Without this, the planner floats as an isolated study with no connection to the broader Art curriculum.

### 9. Pitfalls, Sensitive Content, Success Criteria

The pitfalls section is excellent and immediately practical:

1. "Pupils draw figures as stick men rather than Lowry's distinctive elongated forms -- study his figures closely first"
2. "Background buildings all the same height -- teach how Lowry varied scale to create depth"
3. "Colour mixing defaults to dark grey -- demonstrate the range of warm and cool greys Lowry used"

These are specific, classroom-tested observations that would genuinely help a non-specialist teacher. Pitfall 3 about colour mixing is exactly the kind of practical guidance that is otherwise absent from the techniques section. I wish the techniques section itself had this level of specificity.

There is no sensitive content section. Lowry's paintings depict industrial poverty, working-class life, and social deprivation. For some children, this may connect to their own family experiences of economic hardship. A brief note -- "Be aware that discussions about poverty and working conditions may be sensitive for some pupils. Frame Lowry's subjects with respect and avoid presenting working-class life as inherently lesser" -- would be appropriate.

There are no success criteria. For 5 lessons, I would expect end-of-unit success criteria: "Pupils can describe Lowry's style and explain its connection to his historical context; Pupils can mix muted tones and use them in a composition; Pupils can create an industrial landscape painting in the style of Lowry showing foreground, middleground and background."

### 10. Vocabulary

The vocabulary word mat lists 8 terms: landscape, perspective, composition, foreground, background, industrial, urban, muted palette. The terms are well chosen and appropriate for Y3-Y4 Art.

The "Meaning" column is empty for every term. This is a critical omission. A vocabulary word mat with no definitions is not a usable teaching resource. The V7/V8 Maths planners I reviewed had full definitions for every term. The auto-generator clearly can populate definitions for Maths concepts but has not done so for Art vocabulary.

For a primary generalist who may not be confident with Art terminology, definitions are essential. "Muted palette" is specialist vocabulary that many Y3 teachers would need defined. Even "composition" has a specific Art meaning (the arrangement of elements within a picture) that differs from its everyday English meaning.

## What I Could Teach From This Planner (Without External Resources)

1. I could introduce Lowry as an artist: his dates, his movement (British Realism), his cultural context, his subjects. The Art History concept description gives me enough content knowledge to deliver a meaningful introduction.

2. I could set up differentiated learning objectives for Art History knowledge using the three-level differentiation table. I know what Entry, Developing, and Expected look like.

3. I could plan colour mixing activities focused on muted tones, using the pitfall about "dark grey" as a teaching point. I would need to experiment with the actual paint colours myself before the lesson.

4. I could address the cross-curricular History link confidently -- connecting Lowry to the Industrial Revolution is natural and the planner gives me enough context to do this meaningfully.

5. I could assess pupils' Art History knowledge using the differentiation descriptors: can they name Lowry and one fact (Entry)? Can they describe his distinctive features and historical period (Developing)? Can they compare him with another artist (Expected)?

## What I Would Still Need to Create Myself

1. **A 5-lesson scheme of work.** The planner has no lesson-by-lesson structure. I would need to design the sequence, timings, and activities for each lesson.

2. **Technique teaching instructions.** How to teach muted colour mixing, how to draw Lowry-style figures, how to teach basic foreground/background composition to Y3. These are the core practical skills of the unit and they are not covered.

3. **Visual resources.** I need high-quality reproductions of Lowry paintings to display and discuss. The planner does not reference any specific works. Which Lowry paintings should I use? "Going to the Match," "Coming from the Mill," "Industrial Landscape"? The selection matters for teaching different techniques.

4. **Vocabulary definitions.** Every definition in the word mat is blank.

5. **Assessment tasks for Drawing and Painting.** The Art History concept has full differentiation with example tasks, but Drawing Mastery and Painting Mastery only have "what success looks like" descriptors. I need practical assessment tasks.

6. **Success criteria for the unit.** What should all, most, and some pupils be able to do/show by the end of 5 lessons?

7. **Sensitive content notes.** Framing poverty and working-class life respectfully.

## Comparison to V7

In V7, I reviewed a Y3 Maths Fractions cluster and scored it 7.5/10. That review had DifficultyLevel data which transformed differentiation and practice questions. In my early V8 review, I scored a Y3 Maths Measurement cluster 8.5/10 because RepresentationStage data added CPA progression.

This Art planner is a fundamentally different proposition. It is not drawing from ConceptClusters with DifficultyLevels, ThinkingLenses, RepresentationStages, PedagogyProfiles, and InteractionTypes. It is drawing from the per-subject ontology (ArtTopicSuggestion nodes), which provides subject-specific metadata (artist, movement, medium, techniques, visual elements) but lacks the pedagogical infrastructure that made the Maths planners so strong.

The per-subject ontology gives me WHAT to teach about Lowry. But it does not give me:
- HOW to structure the lessons (no vehicle template surfaced)
- HOW to differentiate the practical work (DifficultyLevels only exist for Art History, not Drawing/Painting skills)
- HOW to frame the learning (no thinking lens)
- HOW to assess (no success criteria)

The result is a planner that works as a content briefing but not as a teaching plan. A Maths planner from this system would get me 75-80% of the way to a classroom-ready lesson. This Art planner gets me about 40%.

## Score: 5.5 / 10

The concepts and differentiation data are genuine strengths, and the pitfalls section is excellent. But the absence of lesson structure, technique teaching guidance, vocabulary definitions, thinking lenses, and success criteria means this planner cannot stand alone as a teaching document. A primary generalist would need significant additional preparation -- probably 2-3 hours of planning on top of what the planner provides.

Compared to V7 (7.5/10 for Maths), this is a step backwards, but that is not a fair comparison. The Maths graph data is much more mature (DifficultyLevels, CPA stages, ConceptClusters, ThinkingLenses, InteractionTypes). The Art ontology is newer and thinner. The auto-generator is doing what it can with the data available -- the problem is the data, not the generator.

The score would rise to 7/10 with: filled vocabulary definitions, a 5-lesson structure from a vehicle template, thinking lens integration, and success criteria. It would reach 8/10 with technique teaching guidance and specific Lowry painting references.
