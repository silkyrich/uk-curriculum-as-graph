# Lesson Plan: Why did the Romans invade Britain, and did it matter?

**Teacher**: Ms. Farah (Y4 History)
**Cluster**: HI-KS2-D004-CL001 — Analyse causes, consequences and the significance of historical events
**Duration**: 50 minutes
**Vehicle Template**: Source Enquiry + Topic Study (combined)

---

## Learning Objective

Pupils will use historical sources as evidence to explain **multiple causes** for the Roman invasion of Britain and begin to **evaluate** which causes were most significant, developing the disciplinary concepts of **Cause and Consequence** and **Significance**.

This is explicitly a disciplinary history lesson. The substantive content (Roman Britain) is the vehicle; the learning is about how historians use evidence to construct causal explanations and make judgements about significance.

## Success Criteria (from DifficultyLevel tiers)

| Tier | Success Criterion |
|---|---|
| **Entry** | I can identify one reason why the Romans invaded Britain when given options or prompts. |
| **Developing** | I can describe more than one cause for the Roman invasion and at least one consequence. |
| **Expected** | I can explain how multiple causes combined, and I can distinguish between short-term and long-term consequences of the invasion. |
| **Greater Depth** | I can argue which cause was most significant, supporting my argument with evidence from the sources. |

## Key Vocabulary

| Term | Definition (for first use) |
|---|---|
| **cause** | A reason why something happened |
| **consequence** | What happened as a result of an event |
| **significance** | How important something was in history, and why |
| **factor** | One of several reasons that together explain why something happened |
| **evidence** | Information from sources that helps us support a claim |
| **source** | Something that survives from or tells us about the past |
| **reliability** | How far we can trust what a source tells us |

---

## Vehicle Template

I am using a combination of **Source Enquiry** and **Topic Study**.

The Source Enquiry agent prompt states:

> "Use the SOURCE ENQUIRY template: present 2-3 carefully selected historical sources with clear context about when and why each was made. Guide pupils to describe what each source shows, consider who created it and why, and begin to cross-reference sources. Support them in forming an interpretation based on the evidence."

The Topic Study agent prompt states:

> "Use the TOPIC STUDY template: open with an engaging hook that raises a question or challenge. Build context using a timeline or key facts. Introduce 2-3 sources for pupils to analyse, prompting them to consider who made each source and why. Guide pupils toward forming their own interpretation, supported by evidence from the sources."

I am combining these because the lesson opens with a hook and contextual framing (Topic Study) but the core activity is source-based reasoning about causes (Source Enquiry). This is how disciplinary history actually works in practice -- you don't separate "learning about a topic" from "working with sources."

## Subject References Used

### Historical Sources (from HS-KS2-002 — Roman Britain)
- **Vindolanda Tablets** -- personal letters from Roman soldiers stationed on the northern frontier. These are outstanding because they are written by real people and reveal mundane, human details (requests for socks, complaints about beer). They show pupils that historical evidence is not always grand or dramatic.
- **Roman Coins from Britain** -- coins depicting Roman emperors and propaganda messages. These are useful for showing how rulers communicated their power and justify their actions. The imagery on coins was deliberate -- it is an early form of spin.
- **Hadrian's Wall** -- monumental archaeological evidence of Roman presence, military infrastructure, and the boundary of empire. Useful for consequence: what did the Romans build, and what does that tell us about the scale of the invasion's impact?

### Disciplinary Concepts (from HS-KS2-002)
- **Cause and Consequence** -- the analytical framework structuring the whole lesson. Pupils are not just retelling a story; they are categorising and ranking causes.
- **Evidence and Interpretation** -- embedded in the source work. The lesson explicitly asks: who made this source, and why should we trust it?
- **Significance** -- the evaluative endpoint. Causes are ranked by significance, requiring pupils to make and justify judgements.

## Cross-Curricular Link

**Roman Britain** (HistoryStudy) --> **Spelling and Vocabulary: Word Detective** (EnglishUnit) [strong]
Hook: "Latin roots in English vocabulary"

In the lesson, when discussing the Vindolanda Tablets, I will draw attention to Latin-origin words that survive in modern English (e.g., *wall* from *vallum*, *street* from *strata*, *port* from *portus*). This is a natural extension of the source analysis -- looking at what the Romans left behind includes the words we still use. This connects to the Y4 English curriculum on word roots and etymology, and can be picked up in a follow-up English lesson on Latin prefixes and suffixes.

## Lesson Sequence

### Phase 1: Hook and Challenge Problem (8 minutes)

**Productive failure sequence** -- challenge problem first, no instruction.

Display a simplified image of a Roman coin showing Claudius and a triumphal arch with "DE BRITANNIA" inscribed. Ask:

*"This coin was made in Rome in 43 AD. What is Claudius trying to tell people? Why would he want everyone to know about invading Britain?"*

Pupils discuss in pairs for 2 minutes, then share ideas. Do not confirm or deny any answer. Use Socratic questioning from the inference task interaction type:
1. "What do you notice?"
2. "What does that tell you?"
3. "Why do you think that?"

Record pupils' initial ideas on the board. We will return to these.

**Interaction type**: Inference Task -- Socratic Questioning (primary).

### Phase 2: Contextual Knowledge Building (7 minutes)

Brief contextual framing using a timeline:
- 55 BC: Julius Caesar raids Britain but does not stay
- 43 AD: Emperor Claudius sends 40,000 soldiers to invade
- By 80 AD: Romans control most of England and Wales
- 122 AD: Hadrian's Wall built
- 410 AD: Romans leave Britain

Key context: Britain was not empty. Celtic peoples lived here with their own culture, trade, and beliefs. The Romans were an empire that had already conquered much of Europe. Claudius was a new emperor who some people thought was weak -- he needed a military victory.

This is teacher-led exposition, kept short. The purpose is to give enough context for the source analysis to make sense.

### Phase 3: Source Analysis -- What Caused the Invasion? (18 minutes)

Present three source packs. Each pair or group receives all three.

**Source A: The Vindolanda Tablet (adapted excerpt)**
A letter from a Roman officer mentioning Britain's tin and lead mines. Context card: "This was found at Vindolanda, a Roman fort near Hadrian's Wall. It was written on a thin piece of wood."

**Source B: Roman Coin of Claudius**
The coin from the hook, now with more context. "Claudius became emperor in 41 AD. Some senators thought he was a fool. This coin was made after the invasion."

**Source C: A modern historian's statement (adapted)**
"The Romans invaded Britain for several reasons: its valuable metals, its strategic position, and Claudius's need for a military victory to prove himself as emperor." Context card: "Written by a historian in 2019, based on archaeological and written evidence."

**Structured task sequence:**

1. **Describe** (3 mins): For each source, pupils write one sentence about what it shows or tells us. Use text highlight interaction type to identify the key evidence in each source.

2. **Question** (5 mins): For each source, pupils answer: "Who made this, and why? Can we fully trust it?" This targets the Evidence and Interpretation disciplinary concept. Pupils should recognise that the coin is propaganda (Claudius wanted to look strong), the Vindolanda tablet is a private letter (less likely to be biased, but only one person's view), and the modern historian has used many sources but is interpreting them.

3. **Categorise causes** (5 mins): Using a drag-to-categorise activity, pupils sort the causes they have identified into categories:
   - Economic (tin, lead, wool, grain)
   - Political (Claudius needed a victory)
   - Military/strategic (control of the Channel)

4. **Cross-reference** (5 mins): "Do any of the sources agree with each other? Do any of them give us different information?" Pupils annotate their source packs with arrows showing connections.

**Interaction types**: Text Highlight and Select (primary), Drag to Categorise (secondary), Matching Pairs (primary -- matching cause to category).

### Phase 4: Evaluative Discussion -- Which Cause Was Most Significant? (10 minutes)

This is the disciplinary step that separates "listing causes" from "historical reasoning."

Introduce the significance criteria explicitly:
- How many people did this affect?
- Did it change what happened next?
- Would the invasion have happened without this cause?

Pose the enquiry question:

*"Several factors led to the Roman invasion: valuable metals, Claudius needing to prove himself, and Britain's strategic position. Which do you think was the **most important** cause? You must use evidence from the sources to support your argument."*

Pupils write a short paragraph using the sentence frame:

*"I think the most important cause of the Roman invasion was ______ because ______. Source [A/B/C] supports this because ______. However, ______ was also important because ______."*

This targets the Greater Depth tier but is scaffolded so all pupils can access it through the sentence frame. Entry-level pupils may only complete the first sentence. Developing pupils will give two causes. Expected pupils will use the full frame.

**Interaction type**: Text Input -- Short Phrase (primary). Accept key terms and partial explanations per the learner profile. Provide the sentence starter if a pupil stalls.

### Phase 5: Plenary and Reflection (7 minutes)

Return to the initial ideas from Phase 1. Read them back.

*"Look at what you said at the start of the lesson. Has your thinking changed? What do you know now that you did not know then?"*

Select 2-3 pupils to share their "most important cause" argument. After each, ask: "Does anyone disagree? What evidence would you use?"

Close with the key disciplinary point: "Historians rarely agree on one single cause. The skill is being able to **argue your case with evidence** -- just like you did today."

## Differentiation (using DifficultyLevel tiers)

| Tier | Scaffolding | Task Modification |
|---|---|---|
| **Entry** | Source packs pre-highlighted with key information. Cause cards provided to sort rather than identify independently. Sentence frame with first clause completed. | Identify one cause from the sources. |
| **Developing** | Key vocabulary displayed on table. Source question prompts provided ("Who made this? When? Why?"). Full sentence frame available. | Describe two or more causes and one consequence. |
| **Expected** | No additional scaffolding on sources. Full enquiry question. Sentence frame available but not required. | Explain how multiple causes combined. Use evidence from sources. Distinguish short-term/long-term consequences. |
| **Greater Depth** | Extension source provided (a Celtic perspective on the invasion -- modern reconstruction). Prompted to consider counter-arguments. | Evaluate relative importance of causes. Construct a sustained argument with evidence. Consider why different historians might rank the causes differently. |

## Assessment Opportunities

| Point in Lesson | What I Am Assessing | How |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 (Hook) | Prior knowledge of Roman Britain; ability to read visual sources | Observing pair discussion; noting who identifies the coin as propaganda |
| Phase 3, Step 2 | Understanding of source provenance and reliability (Evidence and Interpretation) | Written responses to "Who made this, and why?" |
| Phase 3, Step 3 | Ability to categorise causes (Cause and Consequence -- Developing tier) | Accuracy of drag-to-categorise activity |
| Phase 4 | Evaluative reasoning about significance (Expected/Greater Depth) | Written paragraph -- checking for: multiple causes, evidence citation, use of "because/however" |
| Phase 5 (Plenary) | Metacognitive awareness of own learning; ability to articulate disciplinary process | Quality of verbal reflection on how thinking changed |

**Key assessment focus**: Can pupils move beyond listing causes to **ranking and justifying** them with evidence? This is the disciplinary threshold between Entry/Developing and Expected/Greater Depth.

## Resources Needed

- Printed or digital source packs (A, B, C) with context cards
- Roman coin image (high resolution)
- Cause category cards (for Entry-level drag-to-categorise)
- Sentence frame strips
- Timeline display (55 BC -- 410 AD)
- Key vocabulary display

## Notes

The learner profile specifies a session length of 15-25 minutes for digital interactions. This is a 50-minute lesson with mixed modalities (discussion, source analysis, writing). If delivering digitally, this would need to be split across two sessions, with Phase 1-3 in session one and Phase 4-5 in session two. The 2-10 day spacing interval could be applied between them.

The Thinking Lens section recommended **Cause and Effect** as the primary lens, which aligns perfectly with this lesson's focus. The **Evidence and Argument** lens (secondary recommendation) is embedded in the source analysis phases. The question stems provided ("What caused this to happen? Is there more than one reason?") were directly usable in the lesson structure.
