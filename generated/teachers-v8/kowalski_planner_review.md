## Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. Header and Metadata

The header is clean and well-structured. Subject, Key Stage, Year group (Y3), statutory reference, source document, study type, and status are all present and correct. The statutory reference — "Reading - Comprehension (Y3-4): increasing their familiarity with a wide range of books, including fairy stories, myths and legends" — is accurately pulled from the National Curriculum and gives me the exact curriculum anchor I need.

Two issues. First, the source document says "KS2 English Grammar, Punctuation and Spelling Test Framework 2016" — this is wrong for a reading comprehension unit. That test framework is about SPaG, not reading. The source document should reference the National Curriculum Programmes of Study for English (2014) or the KS2 Reading Test Framework if we are talking assessment. This is a data quality error in the planner generator — it appears to be applying the same source document to all English planners regardless of domain.

Second, there is no estimated duration. How many lessons is this? A myths unit for Y3 would typically be 2-3 weeks (10-15 lessons). The planner gives me no guidance on scope. In V7, the cluster context also showed "None lessons" for estimated teaching time, so this is a persistent gap.

**Rating:** Good metadata structure, but source document error undermines confidence.

### 2. Enquiry Questions

There are no enquiry questions in this planner. For a Y3 English unit on myths, I would expect at least one overarching question such as "Why do cultures create myths?" or "What do myths tell us about the people who created them?" The geography planner (I glanced at Mr. Obi's) has an enquiry question section. English planners should too — in many schools, English units are framed around a key question that drives the reading and writing.

**Rating:** Missing. Not a deal-breaker for English, but it would strengthen the planner.

### 3. Concept Quality and Differentiation

This is the strongest section of the planner and a significant improvement over V7.

The primary concept — "Fairy stories, myths and legends" (EN-Y3-C020) — is well described with clear teaching guidance that distinguishes the three sub-genres (fairy stories, myths, legends) and explains their conventions. The common misconceptions are excellent: "Children often use 'fairy tale', 'myth' and 'legend' interchangeably" is exactly the error I see in Y3 classrooms, and "They may think myths are simply 'untrue stories' rather than narratives that served cultural or explanatory purposes" shows genuine pedagogical understanding.

The differentiation table (entry / developing / expected / greater depth) is the single biggest improvement from V7. In my V7 review, I flagged the complete absence of DifficultyLevel data for English. Now, each level has a clear description, an example task, and common errors. The progression is sensible:

- **Entry:** Listening and identifying basic features — appropriate for lower-attaining Y3 pupils
- **Developing:** Recognising characteristics of distinct forms — the key conceptual jump
- **Expected:** Comparing across cultures and retelling orally — matches the NC statutory requirement
- **Greater depth:** Analysing why stories endure and connecting to modern stories — genuine higher-order thinking

The example tasks are specific enough to be usable. "We've read a Norse myth and a Greek myth. What do they have in common? How are they different?" is a task I could give a Y3 class tomorrow. The common errors at each level are not just vague — "Comparing plot details rather than thematic and structural similarities" tells me exactly what to redirect.

The five secondary concepts are listed but only as one-line summaries. I can see EN-Y3-C044 (planning writing from model texts), EN-Y3-C048 (narrative elements), EN-Y3-C054 (multi-clause sentences), and EN-Y3-C055 (present perfect tense). These are sensible companions to the primary concept — a myths unit naturally involves narrative writing and grammatical structures. However, the secondary concepts do not have their own differentiation tables or teaching guidance within this planner. For a complete unit plan, I would need differentiation data for those too.

**Rating:** Strong. The DifficultyLevel data for the primary concept transforms the planner's usefulness.

### 4. Subject-Specific Content

The "Text type and features" section is genuinely useful. It identifies the text type (Fiction), names the features to teach (supernatural elements, heroic quest structure, moral or origin explanation, archetypal characters), and gives a clear writing outcome: "Retell a myth from a different culture (400-500 words) preserving key features of the genre including supernatural elements, a quest, and a moral."

This is exactly what I need. The word count (400-500) is appropriate for Y3. The features list gives me a success criteria checklist for the writing outcome. The grammar focus (multi-clause sentences with conjunctions, paragraphs, present perfect tense) is correctly identified from the Y3 Appendix 2 — and the present perfect tense is a smart inclusion, because myths often use "The gods have spoken" / "Heroes have always..." constructions.

The suggested texts — *Tales of Ancient Egypt* by Roger Lancelyn Green and *The Orchard Book of Greek Myths* by Geraldine McCaughrean — are real, widely available, and appropriate for Y3. Both are commonly used in primary schools for myths teaching. The brief annotations ("Accessible retellings with strong narrative structure" / "Rich vocabulary with clear storytelling") are helpful but minimal.

What is missing: only two texts are suggested, and both are from classical civilisations (Egyptian and Greek). A unit called "Myths from Around the World" should include myths from diverse cultures — at minimum, one non-European tradition (e.g., West African Anansi stories, Hindu myths, Norse myths, Native American creation stories). The planner's title promises cultural breadth but the suggested texts do not deliver it.

The literary terms (myth, legend, hero, quest, supernatural, moral, archetype) are age-appropriate for Y3, though "archetype" is ambitious — I would introduce it but not expect all pupils to use it independently.

**Rating:** Good. Text type features and writing outcome are strong. Suggested texts are too narrow for the unit's scope.

### 5. Thinking Lenses

There is no explicit thinking lens section in this planner. In V7, the cluster context provided a named thinking lens (Patterns) with question stems and an agent prompt. This planner appears to be generated from the per-subject ontology (EnglishUnit) rather than from ConceptClusters, and the thinking lens data has not carried across.

This is a regression. The Patterns lens worked well for the grammar cluster I reviewed in V7 — the question stems ("What rule connects these examples?") were directly usable. For a myths unit, I would expect a lens like "Perspective and Interpretation" (why do different cultures tell similar stories?) or "Continuity and Change" (how have myths changed over time? what stays the same?). The graph has these lenses — they just are not surfaced in the planner.

**Rating:** Missing. The thinking lens was one of the V7 strengths; its absence here is noticeable.

### 6. Session Structure / Vehicle Templates

There is no session structure, lesson sequence, or vehicle template in this planner. The planner provides a unit overview but not a lesson-by-lesson breakdown. In V7, the learner profile gave me a 5-phase pedagogy sequence (challenge problem, guided exploration, worked example, independent practice, retrieval practice) that I adapted to a 60-minute lesson. Here, there is no equivalent.

For a 2-3 week myths unit, I would expect at least an outline sequence: Week 1 (reading and analysing myths), Week 2 (planning and drafting), Week 3 (editing and publishing). The planner gives me a writing outcome but no pathway to reach it.

I know that VehicleTemplate nodes exist in the graph with age-banded prompts (24 templates, TEMPLATE_FOR KeyStage). None appear in this planner. If a "Genre Study" vehicle template exists, its pedagogical guidance should be included here — it would tell me the typical structure for teaching through a genre study.

**Rating:** Missing. A significant gap for a unit-level planner.

### 7. Cross-Curricular Opportunities

The cross-curricular table lists two links: "Ancient Greek Pottery" (mythological illustration styles) and "Ancient Greece" (myths as windows into beliefs and values). Both are marked as "Strong" strength. These are sensible connections — if the school teaches Ancient Greece in Y3 History, the myths unit naturally aligns.

However, the "Subject" column says "None" for both entries. This is clearly a data quality issue — the links should reference Art and Design (pottery) and History (Ancient Greece). The generator is not populating the subject field from the cross-curricular relationship data.

More importantly, these are the only two connections listed. A myths unit has rich cross-curricular potential: Drama (performing myths, freeze frames, hot-seating characters), Art (mythological illustration, clay work, masks), Geography (locating the cultures that created these myths on a world map), RE/PSHE (discussing moral lessons, different belief systems). Only two connections feels thin for a unit that is inherently cross-curricular.

**Rating:** Partially useful. The connections listed are valid but the subject field is broken and the coverage is narrow.

### 8. Sequencing

The planner states "Leads to: Adventure Narrative: The BFG." This is a sensible progression — from traditional narrative structures (myths) to a modern adventure narrative using similar techniques (quest, hero, supernatural elements). There is no "Follows" entry, so I do not know what unit precedes this one. A complete sequence would show: previous unit -> this unit -> next unit.

**Rating:** Minimal but correct for what is present.

### 9. Pitfalls, Sensitive Content, Success Criteria

The three pitfalls are well-chosen and practical:

1. "All myths treated as interchangeable rather than exploring how cultural context shapes the story" — this is the most common planning error for myths units. Teachers often teach Greek myths exclusively and call it "world myths."
2. "Retelling is flat plot summary without vivid language or dialogue" — addresses the writing quality issue directly.
3. "Supernatural elements treated superficially rather than exploring why myths use them" — pushes towards deeper analysis.

These are not generic warnings — they are specific to this unit and would improve my planning. In V7, there were no pitfalls at all.

There is no sensitive content section, which is a gap. Myths frequently involve violence (slaying monsters, divine punishment), death, and religious/cultural beliefs that may be sensitive for some pupils. A note about handling creation myths in a class with diverse religious backgrounds, or about age-appropriateness of violent imagery in myths, would be valuable.

There are no success criteria in this planner. The writing outcome serves as an implicit success criterion, but I would expect explicit "Pupils can..." statements, as the geography planner provides. This is a significant omission for a unit planner.

**Rating:** Pitfalls are strong. Missing success criteria and sensitive content guidance.

### 10. Vocabulary

The vocabulary word mat lists 8 terms: myth, supernatural, archetype, quest, moral, retell, culture, tradition. These are all appropriate for a Y3 myths unit. The "Meaning" column is empty — definitions are not provided. This is a clear limitation: a word mat without definitions is just a word list. A Y3 pupil (or a parent, or a teaching assistant) needs to know what "archetype" means.

In V7, I praised the graph's vocabulary data as "exceptionally rich" — each concept listed 8-12 key terms. The primary concept's key vocabulary (fairy story, myth, legend, traditional tale, character, hero, villain, moral, magic, convention, retell) is comprehensive. But the word mat section only includes 8 of those 11 terms and provides no definitions for any of them.

The grammar-specific vocabulary (conjunction, clause, paragraph, present perfect tense) from the secondary concepts is not represented in the word mat, even though the grammar focus is listed in the text type section. If this unit teaches multi-clause sentences and present perfect tense, those terms should appear on the vocabulary mat.

**Rating:** Good term selection, but empty definitions are a significant gap.

## What I Could Teach From This Planner (Without External Resources)

1. I could identify the curriculum focus and explain to a colleague or observer exactly which statutory requirements this unit addresses.
2. I could set differentiated objectives using the entry/developing/expected/greater depth table — this is new and genuinely useful.
3. I could plan the writing outcome and share it with pupils: "By the end of this unit, you will retell a myth from a different culture in 400-500 words."
4. I could list the text type features pupils need to include in their writing.
5. I could anticipate the three most common planning pitfalls and avoid them.
6. I could identify the key vocabulary to pre-teach and display.
7. I could order the two suggested texts from the school library.

## What I Would Still Need to Create Myself

1. **A complete unit plan** — lesson-by-lesson breakdown for 10-15 lessons across 2-3 weeks. The planner gives me one page; I need a full teaching sequence.
2. **A wider range of suggested texts** — at minimum 4-5 texts from different cultures (African, Asian, Norse, Indigenous). Two Greek/Egyptian texts do not deliver "myths from around the world."
3. **Model texts and annotated extracts** — example passages showing the text type features, with grammar patterns highlighted. This was the biggest gap in V7 and remains so.
4. **Vocabulary definitions** — the word mat is empty. I need child-friendly definitions for every term.
5. **Lesson-level success criteria** — "I can..." statements for individual lessons, not just the unit writing outcome.
6. **Session structure** — which lessons are reading-focused? Which are writing-focused? When does the grammar teaching happen? The planner does not sequence the learning.
7. **Thinking lens framing** — a cognitive question to drive the unit. "Why do cultures create myths?" or "What patterns do we see across myths from different traditions?"
8. **Assessment criteria** — what does "expected" writing look like for this unit? The differentiation table helps, but I need a rubric for marking the final writing piece.
9. **Grammar in context activities** — how to teach multi-clause sentences and present perfect tense through the myths reading, not as isolated grammar lessons.
10. **Sensitive content guidance** — how to handle religious and cultural elements respectfully.

## Comparison to V7

### What has improved:

1. **DifficultyLevel differentiation** is transformative. In V7, I had no entry/developing/expected/greater depth data for English. Now the primary concept has a full differentiation table with example tasks and common errors. This alone justifies a score increase.
2. **Text type features and writing outcome** are new and specific. V7 had text features on the ContentVehicle but no explicit writing outcome. The 400-500 word retelling with specified genre features is a clear, assessable target.
3. **Suggested texts with annotations** are an improvement over V7's bare text titles.
4. **Pitfalls** are new and genuinely useful. V7 had nothing equivalent.
5. **Grammar focus aligned to Appendix 2** is correctly identified. V7 had grammar focus on the vehicle but it was not mapped to the statutory appendix.

### What has regressed:

1. **No thinking lens.** V7 had "Patterns" with question stems. This planner has nothing.
2. **No session structure.** V7 had the 5-phase pedagogy sequence from the learner profile. This planner has no pedagogical framework.
3. **No learner profile data.** V7 referenced scaffolding levels, hint tiers, and interaction types. This planner references none of these.
4. **Cross-curricular subject field is broken.** V7 had CO_TEACHES relationships with correct subject labels. Here, the subject column says "None."

### What remains the same:

1. **Model texts still absent** — the biggest English-specific gap persists.
2. **Vocabulary definitions still absent** — the word mat is still empty.
3. **No assessment rubric or marking criteria.**
4. **No cross-subject English links** (English-History, English-Science vocabulary).

### Net assessment:

The V8 planner is a different format from V7 — it is a unit planner generated from the per-subject ontology (EnglishUnit) rather than a cluster context dump. This is the right direction. The unit framing (text type, writing outcome, suggested texts, pitfalls) is more useful for planning than a raw cluster with concepts listed. But the planner loses the learner profile, thinking lens, and session structure data that the V7 cluster context provided. The ideal would be to combine both: the unit framing of V8 with the pedagogical infrastructure of V7.

## Score: 7.0 / 10

**Justification:** Up from 6.0 in V7. The DifficultyLevel differentiation table (+0.5), text type features and writing outcome (+0.5), pitfalls (+0.5), and genre metadata (+0.5) represent genuine improvements. Loss of thinking lens, session structure, and learner profile data (-1.0) partially offsets these gains. The core English gap — no model texts, no vocabulary definitions, no lesson-level planning — remains. A 7 means "I can start planning from this" rather than "I can teach from this."
