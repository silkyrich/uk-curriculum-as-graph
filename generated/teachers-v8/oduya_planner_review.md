## Section-by-Section Evaluation

### 1. Header and Metadata

The header correctly identifies Science, KS2, Y5, and marks the study as Mandatory with a 3-lesson estimated duration. The statutory reference is accurate and specific: "Y5 Forces: identify the effects of air resistance, water resistance and friction, that act between moving surfaces." This is directly quotable for planning documentation and tells me exactly which NC statement this enquiry addresses.

**Problems:** The source document field reads "KS2 English Grammar, Punctuation and Spelling Test Framework 2016." This is the same error I see across the planners -- a Science investigation should reference the Science NC programme of study, not an English test framework. It is clearly a data join bug in the generator.

The 3-lesson estimate is reasonable for a focused friction fair test. I would typically allocate 3-4 lessons: one for prediction and planning, one for investigation, one for analysis and conclusion. The estimate aligns with my practice.

### 2. Enquiry Questions

One enquiry question: "How does the surface affect how far a toy car travels?"

This is well-formed for a Y5 fair test. It identifies the independent variable (surface), the dependent variable (distance), and frames the investigation as a question that can be answered through controlled testing. The language is age-appropriate without being condescending.

**What I would change:** I would add a second, broader question to contextualise the investigation: "Why do car tyres have tread, and why do football boots have studs?" This connects the investigation to real-world applications and gives children a reason to care about friction beyond "we are doing an experiment." The planner's pitfalls section hints at this ("Pupils confuse friction with gravity or air resistance") but the enquiry question itself is narrowly practical.

One question for a 3-lesson sequence is thin. In my V7 Separating Mixtures review, the cluster context provided a richer set of conceptual questions that I could adapt. Here, the planner gives me one procedural question and I would need to generate the conceptual framing myself.

### 3. Concept Quality and Differentiation

Two concepts are provided: a primary concept (Contact and Non-Contact Forces, SC-KS2-C025) and a secondary concept (Friction and Movement on Surfaces, SC-KS2-C027).

**Primary concept (Contact and Non-Contact Forces):** The description is comprehensive and the teaching guidance is practical: "Explore contact forces through practical activities", "Create a two-column sorting activity: 'forces that need touching' versus 'forces that act at a distance'", "Use force arrows to represent the direction of forces." These are activities I could use.

The misconceptions section is strong: "Children commonly think a force is needed to keep an object moving, rather than understanding that forces are needed to start, stop or change movement (a precursor to Newton's first law)." This is the classic Y5 misconception and flagging it explicitly helps me plan a diagnostic starter.

The four-tier differentiation table is well-calibrated:
- Entry: "Knowing that pushes and pulls are forces" -- appropriate for children not yet secure at Y5
- Developing: "Distinguishing between contact forces and non-contact forces" -- the core Y5 expectation
- Expected: "Explaining the difference with multiple examples, understanding that forces can be measured" -- includes the quantitative step (Newtons)
- Greater Depth: "Applying understanding where multiple forces act simultaneously, recognising balanced and unbalanced forces" -- the classic "book on a table" question is a genuinely challenging extension

**Secondary concept (Friction and Movement on Surfaces):** Good description that specifically connects to the investigation. The differentiation table is appropriate, though it lacks the "Example task" column that the primary concept has. The Greater Depth descriptor ("Designing friction investigations with controlled variables and applying understanding to explain real-world engineering solutions") is the right level of ambition for high-attaining Y5 pupils.

**Common errors are specific and actionable.** "Thinking smooth surfaces have no friction at all" (Developing) and "Thinking more tread always means more grip" (Greater Depth) are real misconceptions I encounter. The Greater Depth error about water reducing friction ("the tyre loses contact with the road") shows the data author understands the science at a depth beyond the Y5 curriculum.

### 4. Subject-Specific Content

**Variables section:** This is excellent and was my #1 request from V7. The variables are clearly stated:
- Independent: surface type (carpet, wood, sandpaper, tile, fabric)
- Dependent: distance travelled by toy car (cm)
- Controlled: ramp angle, car mass, release point, same car

The specific surface types listed are practical and available in any primary school. The controlled variables list is complete -- ramp angle, car mass, release point, and using the same car. I could hand this list to a child and they could set up the investigation.

**Equipment and safety:** The equipment list is practical and specific: ramp, toy car, metre stick, surface samples (carpet, wood, sandpaper, tile, fabric), masking tape. Masking tape is a nice detail -- it is needed to secure the surface samples flat, which children would not think of independently. This shows practical experience.

Safety notes are appropriate for the hazard level: "Ensure ramp is stable and surfaces are secured flat. Keep floor area clear to prevent tripping." This is a low-risk investigation and the notes reflect that without over-dramatising.

**Expected outcome:** "Rougher surfaces produce more friction, so the car travels a shorter distance. Smooth surfaces produce less friction. Friction is a contact force that opposes motion between surfaces." Clear, correct, at the right level.

**Recording format:** "results table, bar chart, written conclusion" -- appropriate for Y5 and covers the three standard recording types for a fair test.

**Enquiry type:** Correctly identified as a Fair Test with a clear definition. The description ("A controlled investigation where one variable is deliberately changed while all others are kept the same") is accurate and could be used as a class definition.

**Known misconceptions:** Two are listed ("Smooth surfaces have no friction" and "Friction is always unhelpful") but the description fields are empty. The misconception names are there but the explanations are missing. This is the same rendering issue as the vocabulary word mat -- the data structure exists but the content is not populated. The concept-level misconceptions partially compensate, but having named misconceptions with empty descriptions is frustrating.

### 5. Thinking Lenses

No thinking lenses section appears. In V7, the cluster review included "Cause and Effect" as the primary lens with KS2 question stems like "What caused this to happen, and how do we know?" which mapped perfectly to fair test investigations. This was directly usable in my lesson introduction.

The absence is noticeable. For a friction investigation, the Cause and Effect lens would frame the enquiry beautifully: "What causes the car to stop? How do we know it is the surface and not something else?" The enquiry type section partially covers this ground, but without the pedagogical framing that the thinking lens provided.

### 6. Session Structure / Vehicle Templates

No session structure, lesson breakdown, or vehicle template is provided. For a 3-lesson sequence, I would expect at least a minimal outline:
- Lesson 1: Prediction, planning, introduce variables
- Lesson 2: Conduct investigation, record results
- Lesson 3: Analyse data, draw conclusions, connect to real world

The planner gives me all the ingredients (variables, equipment, expected outcome, recording format) but no structure for how to organise them across three lessons. I can construct this myself -- and would in any case -- but a suggested structure would reduce planning time.

In V7, the pedagogy profile gave me a session sequence (challenge problem, guided exploration, worked example, independent practice, retrieval practice) which at least provided a structural skeleton. That is not present here.

### 7. Cross-Curricular Opportunities

Two links are provided:
1. Report Writing: Non-Chronological Reports (English) -- "Writing a scientific conclusion using causal connectives (because, therefore, as a result)" (Moderate)
2. Cam Mechanisms: Moving Toys (DT) -- "Exploring friction in mechanisms and moving parts" (Moderate)

The English link is genuinely useful -- scientific report writing is a staple KS2 cross-curricular connection and naming the specific connectives children should use ("because, therefore, as a result") makes it immediately actionable.

The DT link is valid but would need development. Cam mechanisms do involve friction but the connection is not obvious to children without explicit bridging.

**Problem:** Both entries show "None" in the Subject column, same rendering bug as the History planner.

**Missing link:** There is an obvious Mathematics cross-curricular connection (measuring in cm, calculating averages, drawing bar charts) that is not listed. For Y5, data handling is a natural partner for Science investigations and most Science subject leads would plan this link explicitly.

### 8. Sequencing

No explicit sequencing section (follows/leads-to) is provided. This is a gap. A friction investigation in Y5 should be preceded by gravity and air resistance work (also Y5 Forces) and leads naturally to mechanisms and simple machines. Knowing where this investigation sits in the Forces sequence would help me plan the unit as a whole.

The V7 cluster review provided SEQUENCED_AFTER relationships that made domain-level sequencing clear. This planner drops that information.

### 9. Pitfalls, Sensitive Content, Success Criteria

**Pitfalls** (3 items) are all practical and specific to this investigation:
1. "Inconsistent release of the car on the ramp leads to unreliable data -- model a consistent release technique before starting." This is the #1 source of error in toy car investigations and I always model the release. Good.
2. "Pupils confuse friction with gravity or air resistance -- clarify friction requires contact between two surfaces." Accurate and important.
3. "Pupils may think smooth surfaces have 'no friction' rather than 'less friction'." Reinforces the misconception from the concept section.

All three are actionable. I could share these with a student teacher and they would know what to watch for.

**No sensitive content section.** Appropriate -- friction investigations do not raise sensitivity issues.

**No explicit success criteria section.** The differentiation tables provide a framework for assessment, but there are no "I can..." statements or investigation-specific success criteria (e.g., "I can identify my independent and dependent variables", "I can explain why I kept the ramp angle the same").

### 10. Vocabulary

Seven terms are listed (friction, force, contact force, surface, fair test, variable, conclusion) but all definitions are empty. The same issue as the History planner. The terms are well-chosen for a Y5 friction investigation -- they cover both the science content vocabulary (friction, force, contact force) and the working scientifically vocabulary (fair test, variable, conclusion).

Missing terms that I would add: independent variable, dependent variable, controlled variable, ramp, surface area, Newton (as a unit). Given that the variables section explicitly uses "independent" and "dependent", the vocabulary word mat should include these terms.

## What I Could Teach From This Planner (Without External Resources)

- Set up the investigation: variables clearly defined, equipment listed, surfaces specified
- Explain the science: concept descriptions cover contact vs. non-contact forces and friction specifically
- Differentiate: four-tier tables for both concepts give me assessment descriptors
- Address misconceptions: both concept-level and investigation-specific misconceptions are flagged
- Avoid common practical errors: pitfalls section covers release technique, variable confusion
- Record results: format specified (table, bar chart, conclusion)
- Connect to English: causal connectives for report writing

## What I Would Still Need to Create Myself

- A 3-lesson structure with timings and transitions
- A prediction sheet or planning frame for children to complete before investigating
- A results table template (with columns for surface type, distance attempt 1/2/3, average)
- A bar chart frame or guidance on axis scales
- A conclusion writing frame with sentence starters
- Vocabulary definitions for the word mat
- An extension activity for Greater Depth children (e.g., designing their own friction investigation)
- Links to the broader Y5 Forces unit (gravity, air resistance, mechanisms)
- A diagnostic starter to check prerequisite understanding of pushes and pulls from KS1
- Real-world application examples (tyre tread, ice skating, brakes) for the "friction is useful" discussion
- Misconception descriptions (the named misconceptions have empty explanation fields)

## Comparison to V7

| Aspect | V7 (Cluster Review) | V8 (Planner Review) | Change |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|--------|
| Concept descriptions | Present, useful | Present, equally detailed | Same |
| Differentiation | DifficultyLevel tables available | Four-tier tables present | Major improvement (V7 had DLs for Science) |
| Variables | Not available (had to invent) | Explicit IV/DV/CV with examples | Major improvement |
| Equipment list | Not available | Complete and practical | Major improvement |
| Safety notes | Not available | Present, appropriate | New addition |
| Expected outcome | Not explicit | Clear statement + recording format | New addition |
| Enquiry type | Tagged on content vehicle | Named with definition | Same quality |
| Misconceptions | Strong (concept-level) | Listed but descriptions empty | Partial regression |
| Thinking lenses | Present with KS2 prompts | Missing | Regression |
| Session structure | Pedagogy profile skeleton | Not included | Regression |
| Cross-curricular | Not available | 2 links (subject field empty) | New addition |
| Vocabulary | Terms + definitions from concept | Terms listed, definitions empty | Regression |
| Sequencing | SEQUENCED_AFTER available | Not included | Regression |
| Pitfalls | Not available | 3 practical items | New addition |
| Overall score | 6.0/10 | **7.0/10** | **+1.0** |

The planner format gains substantially in investigation-specific content (variables, equipment, safety, expected outcome) while losing structural and pedagogical elements from the cluster format (thinking lenses, pedagogy profile, sequencing, misconception descriptions). For a practical Science investigation, the trade-off favours the planner format -- the variables and equipment are more immediately useful than thinking lens prompts. But the loss of sequencing and the empty misconception/vocabulary fields prevent a higher score.

## Score: 7.0 / 10
