# Teaching Context (from Graph)


## Domain: GE-KS3-D001 — Locational Knowledge
**Subject:** Geography | **Key Stage:** KS3 | **Age:** 11-14 | **Structure:** knowledge

### Curriculum Context
Locational knowledge at KS3 consolidates and extends the world geography framework established at primary school. Pupils extend their knowledge to include Africa, Russia, Asia (with focus on China and India) and the Middle East - regions that are central to understanding contemporary global issues but often underrepresented in primary curricula. The study of environmental regions within these areas - desert, savannah, polar, rainforest - connects locational knowledge to physical geography and provides the geographical context for understanding human activity. Developing more detailed knowledge of the world's major geographical regions, including their human and physical characteristics, prepares pupils to engage with global issues from a grounded spatial understanding.

### Concepts (1)

#### GE-KS3-C005 — World Regions: Africa, Asia and the Middle East
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

A detailed working knowledge of the world's major geographical regions, with KS3 focus extending to Africa, Russia, Asia (including China and India) and the Middle East. This includes awareness of the environmental regions within these areas (deserts, savannahs, tropical forests, tundra, mountain systems), the major countries and their capitals, the distribution of major cities, and the key physical and human characteristics that give each region its geographical character. At KS3, locational knowledge moves beyond naming towards understanding: why are cities located where they are? How do environmental regions reflect climate and geology? How do physical characteristics shape the human geography of the region?

**Teaching guidance:** Use a physical-political atlas regularly: practise locating countries, capitals, major cities and physical features across Africa, Russia, Asia and the Middle East. Connect locational knowledge to thematic geography: when studying development, connect to specific countries in sub-Saharan Africa; when studying urbanisation, connect to Chinese and Indian megacities; when studying climate change, connect to the Arctic and the Middle East. Build locational knowledge cumulatively — return to maps regularly rather than treating it as a one-off coverage exercise. Use digital mapping tools (Google Earth, GIS) to explore regions at different scales, connecting satellite imagery to conventional cartographic representation.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils frequently have very limited knowledge of African geography beyond a small number of countries, treating Africa as a single undifferentiated region. Regular mapping activities that distinguish African countries, capitals and regions address this at KS3. Pupils may not appreciate the vast internal geographical diversity of regions like Asia or Russia; studying specific contrasting sub-regions within these areas challenges overgeneralisation. Locational knowledge is sometimes treated as rote memorisation rather than as a functional knowledge base that supports geographical analysis; contextualising locations within thematic geography makes locational knowledge purposeful.

**Key vocabulary:** Africa, Asia, Russia, Middle East, region, environmental region, desert, savannah, tundra, tropical, continent, country, capital, megacity, political map, physical map, distribution, characteristics

**GE-KS3-D001-CL001** — Develop detailed locational knowledge of Africa, Asia and the Middle East [CURATED]
Type: practice
Concepts: GE-KS3-C005 (World Regions: Africa, Asia and the Middle East)
Rationale: Single concept domain; extending locational knowledge to Africa, Asia and the Middle East is the KS3 focus — building on KS2 European/Americas knowledge, pupils develop a fluent working knowledge of these major world regions including their physical and political geography.
Inspired by: C3 Framework D2.Geo.2 — using geographic representations to explain relationships between places

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**GE-KS3-D001-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Building fluent locational knowledge of major world regions involves recognising the spatial patterns of political boundaries, physical features and population distribution — not just memorising names but understanding why countries, cities and landscapes are distributed as they are.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Scale, Proportion and Quantity**: How big, how many, or how much — and how does that change how we think about it?
  Why: These are vast and internally diverse regions; developing working knowledge requires pupils to reason across scales — from continental patterns to sub-regional variation — and to hold quantitative proportions (relative sizes, distances, populations) in mind.
  AI instruction: Use the SCALE, PROPORTION AND QUANTITY lens: prompt pupils to compare quantities using ratios and percentages, consider what changes when scale changes, and choose appropriate units of measurement. Useful questions: 'How many times bigger?', 'What fraction of the whole?', 'What changes when we zoom in/out?', 'Which units fit best here?'

### Objectives (1)
- GE-KS3-O001 [statutory]: consolidate and extend their knowledge of the world's countries, using maps of the world to focus on Africa, Russia, Asia and the Middle East, focusing on their environmental regions, including polar and hot deserts, key physical and human characteristics, countries, and major cities

## Domain: GE-KS3-D002 — Place Knowledge
**Subject:** Geography | **Key Stage:** KS3 | **Age:** 11-14 | **Structure:** knowledge

### Curriculum Context
Place knowledge at KS3 is centred on regions that offer contrast and complexity: a region in Africa and a region in Asia. These choices ensure that pupils develop knowledge of parts of the world that are central to global patterns of development, migration, conflict and environmental change, but that are often poorly understood by UK pupils. Understanding regions in depth - their physical geography, their human geography, the interaction between human activity and physical environment, and how these relationships change over time - develops the sophisticated place knowledge that underpins geographical understanding of global issues. The requirement to understand how places change over time prevents static, stereotypical portrayals of places and develops awareness of dynamism and agency.

### Concepts (1)

#### GE-KS3-C006 — Place Depth Study: Africa and Asia
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Depth place study at KS3 requires developing detailed, nuanced understanding of specific regions in Africa and Asia — not merely cataloguing their characteristics, but understanding the dynamic interaction between physical geography, human activity, historical development and current change. Studying a region in Africa and a region in Asia ensures that pupils encounter parts of the world that are central to contemporary global issues (development, urbanisation, climate change, population growth, political conflict, migration) but often poorly understood by UK pupils. The requirement to understand how places change over time prevents static, stereotypical portrayals and develops awareness of agency and dynamism within studied regions.

**Teaching guidance:** Choose specific, real regions rather than dealing with Africa or Asia in generalities: a region of sub-Saharan Africa (e.g. the Sahel, East Africa's Rift Valley, the Niger Delta), a region of south or east Asia (e.g. the Ganges plain, coastal China, the Mekong delta). Develop each region study through multiple lenses: physical geography (what is the landscape, climate, ecology?), human geography (how do people live, work and move?), development (how wealthy and developed is the region? why?), change (how is it changing and why?), connections (how is it connected to the UK and global economy?). Avoid stereotyping by using a range of sources including local voices and contemporary images, not only external accounts. Connect the studied regions to the wider themes studied in KS3 (development, urbanisation, climate change) to build integrated geographical understanding.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may develop a static, stereotypical view of studied regions based on media images (famine, conflict, poverty for Africa; economic dynamism or overcrowding for Asia). Studying change over time and using diverse sources including contemporary, local perspectives challenges these stereotypes. The idea that depth place study is merely factual accumulation misses its primary purpose: developing the analytical skills of geographical description, explanation, comparison and evaluation that transfer across all place contexts. Pupils sometimes equate studying a region with knowing facts about it; developing the ability to ask geographical questions and interpret evidence is more important than knowing any specific set of facts.

**Key vocabulary:** place study, region, Africa, Asia, human geography, physical geography, depth study, interaction, change, development, connection, comparison, local, global, dynamic

### ConceptClusters (1)

**GE-KS3-D002-CL001** — Investigate a region of Africa or Asia through in-depth place study [CURATED]
Type: practice
Concepts: GE-KS3-C006 (Place Depth Study: Africa and Asia)
Rationale: Single concept domain; place depth study at KS3 requires nuanced, multi-layered understanding of a specific African or Asian region — pupils apply all geographical concepts and skills to produce a rounded analysis that goes beyond surface description to explain how physical and human factors interact.
Inspired by: C3 Framework D2.Geo.4 — explaining how cultural and environmental characteristics affect the distribution and movement of people

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**GE-KS3-D002-CL001:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Producing a 'rounded analysis' of how physical and human factors interact in an African or Asian region requires treating the place as a system — climate shapes agriculture, topography affects trade routes, historical context influences political structures — where no single factor can be understood in isolation.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Perspective and Interpretation**: Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?
  Why: In-depth place study requires pupils to move beyond outsider description to engage with how inhabitants and insiders understand their own region, including how Western geographical framings can misrepresent places through stereotyping or selective emphasis.
  AI instruction: Use the PERSPECTIVE AND INTERPRETATION lens: prompt pupils to identify the author's or actor's viewpoint, consider what information or experience shapes that perspective, look for omissions or contradictions, and compare multiple accounts. Useful questions: 'Who wrote/said this, and why?', 'What might they have left out?', 'How would someone else see this differently?', 'What would change your view?'

## Domain: GE-KS3-D003 — Human and Physical Geography
**Subject:** Geography | **Key Stage:** KS3 | **Age:** 11-14 | **Structure:** knowledge

### Curriculum Context
The scope of physical and human geography at KS3 expands dramatically to include the geological and tectonic processes that shape the planet over vast timescales, as well as contemporary processes of climate change, glaciation, hydrology and coastal development. In human geography, pupils engage with the major processes transforming the contemporary world: population growth and urbanisation, the uneven geography of development, and the organisation of global economic activity. The curriculum requires understanding of how humans interact with physical environments - modifying them, depending on them, being threatened by them - connecting physical and human geography in ways that mirror the real complexity of geographical processes. This breadth prepares pupils to engage critically with major global challenges.

### Concepts (4)

#### GE-KS3-C001 — Plate Tectonics and Geological Processes
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Plate tectonics is the scientific theory that the Earth's lithosphere is divided into large plates that move relative to each other over geological timescales, driven by convection currents in the mantle. Where plates meet, the interactions produce earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building and ocean trenches. Understanding geological timescales - the vast spans of time over which these processes operate - requires conceptual adjustment from human time frames to geological ones. At KS3, pupils develop understanding of plate tectonics as the unifying theory of physical geography, explaining the distribution of earthquakes, volcanoes and mountain ranges globally.

**Teaching guidance:** Use animated diagrams to show plate movement and the different types of plate boundary (convergent, divergent, transform). Connect plate tectonics to the distribution of volcanoes and earthquakes on a global map. Study specific case studies at different plate boundaries. Explore geological timescales using analogies that make the depth of time comprehensible. Connect to rocks and the rock cycle: how does plate tectonic activity create igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic rocks? Discuss the evidence for plate tectonics: seafloor spreading, fossil distributions, jigsaw fit of continents.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often think plate movement is fast enough to observe directly. Establishing that continental drift occurs at rates measured in centimetres per year over millions of years develops appropriate scale of time. The mechanism of plate movement (convection currents) is frequently confused with the plates themselves; keeping the two clearly distinct prevents conceptual muddle. The relationship between plate boundaries and the locations of earthquakes and volcanoes needs to be established empirically through map work as well as theoretically.

**Key vocabulary:** plate tectonics, lithosphere, mantle, convection, boundary, convergent, divergent, transform, earthquake, volcano, subduction, mountain, ridge, trench, geological timescale

#### GE-KS3-C002 — Global Development and Inequality
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Development refers to the process of improvement in human wellbeing and living standards, measured by indicators such as GDP, HDI, life expectancy, literacy rates and access to services. The geography of development is highly uneven: some parts of the world have achieved high levels of human development while others remain in conditions of poverty and deprivation. Understanding why development is uneven requires analysis of historical factors (colonialism, trade patterns), geographical factors (resource endowment, climate, landlocked position) and current political and economic factors. At KS3, pupils develop the conceptual frameworks to analyse and evaluate patterns of global development.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce a range of development indicators and discuss their strengths and limitations. Map the global distribution of development and identify patterns. Study specific countries at different levels of development using a range of data sources. Analyse the causes of uneven development using multiple factors. Discuss the debate between different theories of development (modernisation, dependency, bottom-up). Connect to trade, aid, debt and migration as mechanisms through which development is shaped. Evaluate proposed solutions to development challenges critically.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may view development as a simple linear progression from 'undeveloped' to 'developed', missing the complexity and political contestation involved. The assumption that more development is always better can be challenged by discussing environmental costs and alternative conceptions of wellbeing. Using the terminology 'developing' and 'developed' can mislead; discussing alternative framings (Global North/South, high-income/low-income) develops more nuanced vocabulary.

**Key vocabulary:** development, GDP, HDI, literacy, life expectancy, inequality, poverty, wealth, aid, trade, debt, colonialism, dependency, sustainable development, indicator

#### GE-KS3-C003 — Climate Change and Environmental Geography
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns, currently driven primarily by human emissions of greenhouse gases. Understanding climate change requires both physical geography knowledge (the mechanisms of the greenhouse effect, feedback loops, ocean circulation) and human geography knowledge (the economic and social causes of emissions, the uneven distribution of impacts and vulnerabilities, and the politics of international responses). At KS3, pupils develop understanding of climate change as a defining geographical challenge of the contemporary period, combining scientific understanding with social and political analysis.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach the physical mechanism of the enhanced greenhouse effect clearly before moving to its consequences. Distinguish between climate (long-term patterns) and weather (short-term conditions), and between natural climate variability and human-induced change. Map the vulnerability of different places to climate change impacts: sea level rise, drought, extreme weather. Explore the uneven responsibility for and impact of climate change. Discuss different responses: mitigation (reducing emissions), adaptation (adjusting to change) and geo-engineering. Connect to pupils' local environment: how might this area change?

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may confuse the ozone hole with the greenhouse effect; these are distinct phenomena with different causes, mechanisms and solutions. The idea that climate change is natural and has always occurred can be used to dismiss human-induced change; distinguishing natural variability from anthropogenic change is crucial. The concept of feedback loops is counterintuitive for many pupils; concrete examples (melting permafrost releasing methane, reduced ice reflecting less sunlight) make feedbacks tangible.

**Key vocabulary:** climate change, greenhouse effect, greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, global warming, feedback, sea level, extreme weather, mitigation, adaptation, vulnerability, emissions, fossil fuel, renewable energy

#### GE-KS3-C004 — Population, Urbanisation and Migration
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Population geography examines the distribution, density, composition and change of human populations. Urbanisation is the process by which an increasing proportion of a population lives in cities, driven by rural-to-urban migration in search of economic opportunities. Migration is the movement of people between places, driven by push factors (poverty, conflict, climate hazards) and pull factors (economic opportunity, safety, family). At KS3, pupils develop understanding of the major demographic processes reshaping the contemporary world: global population growth, urbanisation, ageing populations in wealthy countries and migration at local, national and global scales.

**Teaching guidance:** Use population pyramids to analyse population structure and predict future trends. Map the global distribution of population and explain the factors that determine population density. Study urbanisation in contrasting global contexts: high-income and low-income countries. Examine specific megacities and their challenges. Analyse migration using push-pull frameworks and case studies. Discuss the causes and consequences of population change for environments, economies and societies. Connect to current news and events involving migration, refugees and demographic change.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may assume that population growth is necessarily problematic. The relationship between population density and resource availability is more complex; discussing both overpopulated and underpopulated regions challenges simple correlations. Migration is often portrayed as a problem rather than as a long-standing human response to opportunity and threat; a balanced examination of causes and consequences develops more nuanced understanding. The demographic transition model is a useful but simplified framework; discussing its limitations develops critical thinking.

**Key vocabulary:** population, density, distribution, urbanisation, migration, push factor, pull factor, refugee, megacity, suburb, demographics, birth rate, death rate, natural increase, ageing population

### ConceptClusters (3)

**GE-KS3-D003-CL001** — Investigate plate tectonics and its role in shaping landscapes and hazards [CURATED]
Type: introduction
Concepts: GE-KS3-C001 (Plate Tectonics and Geological Processes)
Rationale: Plate tectonics (C001) is the gateway physical geography concept at KS3 — it is co-taught with development and population (C002, C004) but forms a distinct physical science cluster. Teaching it first gives pupils the physical framework before they explore human responses to geological hazards.
Inspired by: NGSS ESS2.B — Plate Tectonics and Large-Scale System Interactions

**GE-KS3-D003-CL002** — Analyse global development, inequality, population and urbanisation [CURATED]
Type: practice
Sequenced after: GE-KS3-D003-CL001
Concepts: GE-KS3-C002 (Global Development and Inequality), GE-KS3-C004 (Population, Urbanisation and Migration)
Rationale: Global development/inequality (C002) and population/urbanisation/migration (C004) share co-teach hints with each other and with plate tectonics — they form a coherent human geography cluster examining how economic and demographic forces shape where and how people live, and why inequalities persist.
Inspired by: C3 Framework D2.Geo.7 — explaining how economic decisions affect sustainable development

**GE-KS3-D003-CL003** — Evaluate the causes and consequences of climate change and environmental geography [CURATED]
Type: practice
Sequenced after: GE-KS3-D003-CL002
Concepts: GE-KS3-C003 (Climate Change and Environmental Geography)
Rationale: Climate change and environmental geography (C003) is co-taught with development (C002) but stands as a distinct evaluative cluster — pupils examine the science of climate change, its unequal impacts, and the range of human responses, applying critical geographical thinking about sustainability and justice.
Inspired by: NGSS ESS3.D — Global Climate Change; C3 Framework D2.Geo.9 — evaluate the influence of long- or short-term climate variability

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**GE-KS3-D003-CL001:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Plate tectonics is an Earth system process — the movement of tectonic plates drives volcanic activity, earthquakes, mountain building and ocean formation through interlocking physical mechanisms operating over geological time, requiring pupils to model a large-scale physical system.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Stability and Change**: What keeps this stable, what causes change, and how quickly does change happen?
  Why: The tectonic framework explains both the stability of plate interiors and the instability at plate boundaries where hazards occur; pupils must understand why some regions are geologically stable while others experience frequent catastrophic change.
  AI instruction: Use the STABILITY AND CHANGE lens: prompt pupils to identify what conditions keep a system in balance, what disrupts equilibrium, and how change can be gradual or sudden. Useful questions: 'What keeps this the same?', 'What would tip it into change?', 'Is the change reversible?', 'How fast is this changing, and why?'

**GE-KS3-D003-CL002:**
- **Cause and Effect** (primary): What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: This cluster asks why inequalities persist and why populations urbanise — both require multi-factor causal reasoning about how historical, economic, environmental and political forces combine to produce the development gap and patterns of rural-urban migration.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'
- **Systems and System Models**: What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Development, population growth and urbanisation are interdependent — economic growth drives urbanisation which changes demographic structure which affects development indicators — requiring pupils to map the feedback loops within the human geography system.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'

**GE-KS3-D003-CL003:**
- **Stability and Change** (primary): What keeps this stable, what causes change, and how quickly does change happen?
  Why: Climate change is the paradigm case of human-induced destabilisation of a previously stable Earth system; evaluating its causes, unequal impacts and the adequacy of human responses requires pupils to reason about tipping points, feedback loops and the difference between natural variability and anthropogenic forcing.
  AI instruction: Use the STABILITY AND CHANGE lens: prompt pupils to identify what conditions keep a system in balance, what disrupts equilibrium, and how change can be gradual or sudden. Useful questions: 'What keeps this the same?', 'What would tip it into change?', 'Is the change reversible?', 'How fast is this changing, and why?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: The cluster explicitly requires pupils to examine causes (greenhouse gas emissions) and trace consequences (rising temperatures, extreme weather, sea-level rise, ecosystem disruption) while also evaluating whether human responses are sufficient to break the causal chain.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

## Domain: GE-KS3-D004 — Geographical Skills and Fieldwork
**Subject:** Geography | **Key Stage:** KS3 | **Age:** 11-14 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
Geographical skills at KS3 develop in sophistication and range, incorporating geographical information systems (GIS) alongside more traditional map-based skills. Pupils are expected to use a wider range of data sources and analytical techniques, including statistical data, graphs, diagrams and digital mapping. Fieldwork at KS3 includes experience in contrasting locations - urban and rural, coastal and inland - developing the ability to ask geographical questions, collect and analyse primary data, and draw evidence-based conclusions in real geographical environments. The integration of GIS and digital technologies reflects the transformation of professional geographical practice and equips pupils with contemporary geographical tools.

### Concepts (1)

#### GE-KS3-C007 — Geographical Skills: GIS, Maps and Fieldwork
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Geographical skills at KS3 encompass the technical and methodological competencies that geographers use to collect, represent, analyse and communicate spatial information. These include cartographic skills (reading and interpreting Ordnance Survey maps at various scales, using grid references and contours), use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) as digital tools for visualising and analysing spatial data, and the planning and execution of fieldwork in contrasting locations. KS3 fieldwork extends beyond the local environment into contrasting urban, rural, coastal and inland locations, developing the ability to collect primary data, apply analytical techniques and draw evidence-based geographical conclusions. GIS skills connect traditional cartographic literacy to contemporary digital geographical practice.

**Teaching guidance:** Develop map skills in genuine geographical contexts rather than as isolated exercises: use OS maps when studying the landscapes in their area, use atlases when studying global distributions. GIS teaching is most effective when pupils use it to answer real geographical questions: where should a new supermarket be located? What areas are at risk of flooding? Fieldwork should be planned as a genuine enquiry, not merely as a data-collection exercise: pupils should understand what question they are investigating and why their chosen methods are appropriate. Develop digital map literacy alongside traditional OS skills: Google Earth, Google Maps and open data platforms are the tools pupils will use in adult life.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may treat OS map reading as a purely academic exercise rather than as a practical skill with real applications; connecting map work to fieldwork locations they have visited makes the skill purposeful. GIS is sometimes taught as a technical tool rather than as a geographical thinking tool; framing GIS use around geographical questions (where? why there? what patterns?) maintains the geographical focus. Pupils may think that fieldwork data collection is straightforward; the issues of sampling bias, measurement error and reliability require explicit discussion.

**Key vocabulary:** GIS, Ordnance Survey, grid reference, contour, scale, topographic, thematic map, aerial photograph, satellite image, fieldwork, primary data, secondary data, spatial data, layer, overlay, enquiry

### ConceptClusters (1)

**GE-KS3-D004-CL001** — Use GIS, maps and fieldwork methods to collect and communicate geographical data [CURATED]
Type: practice
Concepts: GE-KS3-C007 (Geographical Skills: GIS, Maps and Fieldwork)
Rationale: Single concept domain; GIS, maps and fieldwork at KS3 represent a significant step up in technical skill — pupils learn to design and conduct fieldwork enquiries, use digital mapping tools, and process and present geographical data using statistical and cartographic techniques.
Inspired by: C3 Framework D2.Geo.1 — constructing maps and other representations to explain geographic patterns

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**GE-KS3-D004-CL001:**
- **Evidence and Argument** (primary): What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Designing a fieldwork enquiry, collecting primary data, and processing and presenting findings to answer a geographical question is a complete evidence-to-argument cycle — pupils must ensure their data collection methods generate reliable evidence and then construct geographical arguments from it.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Statistical and cartographic techniques are used to reveal spatial and temporal patterns in geographical data; the purpose of GIS and fieldwork data processing is precisely to make patterns visible that would otherwise be obscured in raw observations.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

## Domain: HI-KS3-D001 — British History from 1066 to Present
**Subject:** History | **Key Stage:** KS3 | **Age:** 11-14 | **Structure:** knowledge

### Curriculum Context
British history at KS3 begins where the primary curriculum ends, taking pupils from 1066 to the present day through a series of substantial period studies. The structure reflects both chronological breadth (covering nearly a thousand years of British history) and thematic depth (organising content around the development of Church, state, society and economy as interconnected themes that run through all periods). Pupils study the transformation of Britain from a feudal medieval monarchy to a parliamentary democracy with a global empire, and then examine how that empire was built and how it dissolved. Studying the Holocaust is specifically mentioned as part of 'challenges for Britain, Europe and the wider world 1901 to present day', reflecting its status as a mandatory topic in the history curriculum with particular moral and educational significance.

### Concepts (2)

#### HI-KS3-C001 — Power, Monarchy and Democracy
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

The history of political power in Britain is the story of the transformation from absolute monarchy to parliamentary democracy over approximately a thousand years. Key stages include the limitation of royal power by Magna Carta (1215), the development of Parliament, the English Civil War and execution of Charles I, the Glorious Revolution and constitutional monarchy, the gradual extension of the franchise, and the welfare state. Understanding this progression requires analysis of the forces that drove change - economic development, religious conflict, intellectual movements, social pressure - and the contested nature of each advance.

**Teaching guidance:** Build an explicit narrative of the development of British democracy as a thread running through medieval and early modern history. Study key moments of constitutional change in depth: Magna Carta, the Civil War, the Glorious Revolution, the Reform Acts, universal suffrage. Analyse the arguments of those who resisted and those who demanded change. Connect to pupils' understanding of current democratic institutions: Parliament, elections, rights. Compare British constitutional development with developments in other countries.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may see the development of democracy as inevitable or straightforward. The contested, reversible nature of each advance - and the real possibility that different outcomes were possible - develops more sophisticated historical understanding. Pupils may present Magna Carta as establishing democracy; in reality it was a document protecting baronial privilege, and its later association with rights is a product of subsequent reinterpretation. The diversity of attitudes to democracy across different social groups at each stage of change needs explicit attention.

**Key vocabulary:** monarchy, parliament, democracy, constitution, rights, revolution, reform, franchise, suffrage, civil war, constitutional, feudal, Magna Carta, sovereignty, power

#### HI-KS3-C002 — Empire, Colonialism and its Consequences
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

The British Empire was at its height one of the largest empires in history, eventually covering approximately a quarter of the world's land surface. Its creation involved trade, conquest, settlement and the exploitation of colonised peoples and their resources. The transatlantic slave trade was an integral part of the economic system of empire. Decolonisation in the twentieth century dismantled formal imperial structures, but the legacies of empire - in patterns of global inequality, migration, cultural exchange and political boundaries - remain central to understanding the contemporary world. At KS3, pupils develop analytical understanding of empire as a global historical force with enduring consequences.

**Teaching guidance:** Study the British Empire across its full chronology: early trading relationships, plantation colonies, conquest of India, the Victorian empire, decolonisation. Connect to the transatlantic slave trade: its scale, mechanisms, economic importance and human consequences. Explore the experiences of colonised peoples as well as colonisers. Study decolonisation: what drove it? Who resisted? What did newly independent states inherit? Connect imperial history to contemporary issues: migration, diversity, global inequality. Be alert to and challenge triumphalist or apologetic framings that oversimplify complex history.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may have received simplified positive or negative narratives about empire. Developing a more complex, evidence-based understanding that acknowledges both the violence and exploitation of empire and the complex ways in which colonised peoples responded to and shaped imperial history is the educational goal. The slave trade is sometimes treated as separate from empire; integrating it as a foundational element of the economic and social history of empire gives it appropriate centrality.

**Key vocabulary:** empire, colonialism, imperialism, slave trade, plantation, colony, decolonisation, independence, exploitation, resistance, trade, legacy, migration, inequality, heritage

These are curated connections to concepts in other domains. Use the rationale to understand WHY these concepts connect.

- **GE-KS3-C003** (Climate Change and Environmental Geography) ↔ **HI-KS3-C001** (Power, Monarchy and Democracy)
  Domain: GE-KS3-D003 (Human and Physical Geography)
  Reason: shared_context
  Rationale: Adeyemi: Climate change is a political issue requiring democratic action. Historical understanding of how political systems respond to crises informs contemporary climate governance debates.
- **GE-KS3-C002** (Global Development and Inequality) ↔ **HI-KS3-C002** (Empire, Colonialism and its Consequences)
  Domain: GE-KS3-D003 (Human and Physical Geography)
  Reason: shared_context
  Rationale: Adeyemi: 'Empire and Development are the SAME STORY told from different disciplinary perspectives.' Colonial history explains current patterns of global development and inequality; development geography provides the evidence base for enduring consequences of empire.
- **GE-KS3-C004** (Population, Urbanisation and Migration) ↔ **HI-KS3-C002** (Empire, Colonialism and its Consequences)
  Domain: GE-KS3-D003 (Human and Physical Geography)
  Reason: feeds_into
  Rationale: Adeyemi: Historical patterns of migration (slave trade, colonial labour, Windrush, post-colonial migration) explain current population distributions and multicultural communities studied in Geography. Migration is both historical and geographical.

### ConceptClusters (2)

**HI-KS3-D001-CL001** — Analyse the transformation of political power from monarchy to parliamentary democracy [CURATED]
Type: introduction
Concepts: HI-KS3-C001 (Power, Monarchy and Democracy)
Rationale: Power, monarchy and democracy (C001) opens British history at KS3 — pupils trace the long-run story of political change from Norman kingship through Magna Carta, Civil War, and the Reform Acts to modern democracy, examining change and continuity across eight centuries.
Inspired by: C3 Framework D2.His.1 — analysing change and continuity within and across periods of history

**HI-KS3-D001-CL002** — Examine the British Empire, colonialism and its enduring consequences [CURATED]
Type: practice
Sequenced after: HI-KS3-D001-CL001
Concepts: HI-KS3-C002 (Empire, Colonialism and its Consequences)
Rationale: Empire, colonialism and its consequences (C002) is co-taught with power and democracy (C001) — imperial expansion is inseparable from British political history and its legacy shapes modern society. Pupils examine causes, justifications, resistance and long-term consequences including migration, culture and contemporary inequalities.
Inspired by: C3 Framework D2.His.5 — explaining connections among historical individuals, ideas, and events across geographic contexts

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**HI-KS3-D001-CL001:**
- **Continuity and Change Over Time** (primary): What has stayed the same, what has changed, and what drove that change?
  Why: The eight-century arc from Norman kingship to modern democracy is an extended continuity_change analysis — pupils must identify the moments of genuine constitutional rupture (Magna Carta, Civil War, Reform Acts) and distinguish them from periods of apparent stability where underlying power relations were shifting incrementally.
  AI instruction: Use the CONTINUITY AND CHANGE OVER TIME lens: prompt pupils to construct timelines, identify turning points, distinguish what changed from what persisted, and explain what drove change. Useful questions: 'What was the same before and after?', 'What was the turning point?', 'Was this a sudden change or a gradual shift?', 'Who or what drove this change?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Each constitutional turning point (the English Civil War, the Glorious Revolution, the Great Reform Act) requires pupils to explain what caused power to shift, which actors drove change, and what the long-run consequences were for the distribution of political authority.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

**HI-KS3-D001-CL002:**
- **Cause and Effect** (primary): What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Examining the causes of imperial expansion, the mechanisms of colonial control, and the long-term consequences — economic, cultural, demographic, linguistic — for both colonised peoples and Britain itself requires sustained multi-strand causal-chain reasoning that connects past actions to present realities.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'
- **Perspective and Interpretation**: Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?
  Why: Colonial history is inherently a story told from multiple, often incompatible perspectives — colonisers justified empire through civilisational narratives while colonised peoples experienced it as dispossession and violence; pupils must engage with these competing interpretations to understand how the same events have been understood so differently.
  AI instruction: Use the PERSPECTIVE AND INTERPRETATION lens: prompt pupils to identify the author's or actor's viewpoint, consider what information or experience shapes that perspective, look for omissions or contradictions, and compare multiple accounts. Useful questions: 'Who wrote/said this, and why?', 'What might they have left out?', 'How would someone else see this differently?', 'What would change your view?'

## Domain: HI-KS3-D002 — World and Non-European History
**Subject:** History | **Key Stage:** KS3 | **Age:** 11-14 | **Structure:** knowledge

### Curriculum Context
World history at KS3 requires study of at least one significant world society or period that is not defined by its relationship to Britain or Europe: Mughal India, Qing China, Russia under the Tsars, or the United States in the twentieth century are suggested examples. This requirement ensures that pupils develop a genuinely global historical perspective, understanding that significant historical developments have occurred simultaneously across the world, not only in Britain and Europe. Connecting world history to British history - through colonialism, trade, conflict and cultural exchange - develops pupils' understanding of how Britain's history is embedded in a global context rather than separate from it.

### Concepts (1)

#### HI-KS3-C003 — The Holocaust: Understanding Genocide
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

The Holocaust was the systematic, state-sponsored persecution and murder of six million Jews by the Nazi regime and its collaborators between 1933 and 1945. It also included the murder of millions of others: Roma, disabled people, Soviet prisoners of war, political opponents, gay men. Understanding the Holocaust requires knowledge of the specific historical context (Weimar Germany, the rise of Nazism, antisemitism), the mechanisms of persecution (propaganda, legal discrimination, ghettoisation, deportation, mass murder), and the responses of bystanders, collaborators, resisters and rescuers. It also requires engagement with the moral questions the Holocaust raises about human nature, responsibility and the fragility of civilisation.

**Teaching guidance:** Follow guidance from the Holocaust Educational Trust and Yad Vashem on sensitive and effective Holocaust education. Begin with individual testimony to establish the human reality before moving to broader historical context. Study the progression of persecution rather than jumping to the death camps. Examine the roles of different groups: perpetrators, bystanders, collaborators, resisters, rescuers. Discuss the conditions that made the Holocaust possible: the role of ideology, propaganda, dehumanisation, bureaucracy and ordinary people's choices. Avoid comparisons that trivialise the Holocaust. Connect to the concept of genocide and international human rights frameworks that emerged in response.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may think the Holocaust happened quickly and suddenly. Understanding the gradual escalation of persecution from 1933 to 1945 - and that it was not inevitable at any stage - develops more nuanced understanding. Pupils may portray all Germans as knowing perpetrators or all as ignorant victims; the complex spectrum of responses - active support, passive compliance, resistance and rescue - challenges simple categorisation. The Holocaust should be understood in its specific historical context rather than as a timeless example of human evil.

**Key vocabulary:** Holocaust, genocide, antisemitism, Nazi, persecution, deportation, concentration camp, extermination, testimony, survivor, bystander, perpetrator, rescuer, never again, memorial

### ConceptClusters (1)

**HI-KS3-D002-CL001** — Understand the Holocaust: causes, events and moral responsibilities [CURATED]
Type: practice
Concepts: HI-KS3-C003 (The Holocaust: Understanding Genocide)
Rationale: Single concept domain; the Holocaust is the mandatory world history unit at KS3 — pupils examine the systematic persecution and genocide of Jewish people and others, placing it in the context of Nazi ideology and the failure of international response, drawing out lessons about prejudice, complicity and moral responsibility.
Inspired by: C3 Framework D2.His.5 — explaining multiple causes of historical events using sourced evidence

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**HI-KS3-D002-CL001:**
- **Cause and Effect** (primary): What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: The Holocaust requires pupils to trace a causal sequence from the conditions that enabled Nazi ideology to take hold, through the escalating persecution, to systematic genocide — and to evaluate the role of individual choices, institutional failures and international inaction in enabling each step.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'
- **Perspective and Interpretation**: Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?
  Why: Examining moral responsibility requires pupils to engage with the perspectives of perpetrators, bystanders, resisters and victims — not to relativise these positions but to understand how ordinary people came to participate in or acquiesce to atrocity, and what this means for contemporary ethical responsibilities.
  AI instruction: Use the PERSPECTIVE AND INTERPRETATION lens: prompt pupils to identify the author's or actor's viewpoint, consider what information or experience shapes that perspective, look for omissions or contradictions, and compare multiple accounts. Useful questions: 'Who wrote/said this, and why?', 'What might they have left out?', 'How would someone else see this differently?', 'What would change your view?'

### Objectives (1)

## Domain: HI-KS3-D003 — Historical Thinking and Disciplinary Skills
**Subject:** History | **Key Stage:** KS3 | **Age:** 11-14 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
Historical thinking at KS3 is expected to become fully developed across all the second-order concepts (the thinking tools of the discipline) as well as substantive historical knowledge. Pupils are expected to understand historical events and periods with increasing analytical sophistication, moving from description to explanation to evaluation and argument. The construction of sustained historical arguments - selecting, organising and deploying evidence to support a thesis - develops the high-level literacy and analytical capabilities that are central to academic historical study. At KS3, history as a discipline is fully established: pupils understand both the knowledge that history produces and the methods by which it produces it.

### Concepts (1)

#### HI-KS3-C004 — Constructing Historical Arguments **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 4

A historical argument is a structured, evidenced response to a historical question, in which a thesis is developed, supported by selected and evaluated evidence, and qualified where necessary by consideration of counter-evidence or alternative interpretations. Constructing historical arguments requires integrating all the second-order concepts of the discipline: chronological knowledge, causal understanding, appreciation of significance, ability to evaluate evidence and awareness of interpretive diversity. At KS3, pupils are expected to construct extended historical arguments in both oral discussion and extended writing.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach argument construction explicitly as a skill: develop a thesis, select supporting evidence, address counter-evidence, conclude. Use structured debate and discussion activities to develop oral argument skills before extended writing. Teach pupils to signal the structure of their argument through discourse markers (However, Furthermore, Nevertheless). Build essay writing skills progressively: from paragraph structure to full essay. Use mark schemes and exemplars to make clear what a strong historical argument looks like. Provide regular feedback focused on argument quality as well as historical knowledge.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may write descriptive narratives rather than analytical arguments, telling a story rather than answering a question. Making the question central and repeatedly asking 'does this sentence answer the question?' redirects from narrative to argument. Pupils may present evidence without linking it explicitly to their argument; teaching them to explain the significance of each piece of evidence develops more analytical writing. The idea that a good historical argument acknowledges and addresses counter-evidence rather than ignoring it is important to establish.

**Key vocabulary:** argument, thesis, evidence, counter-argument, evaluate, interpret, justify, assert, claim, support, qualify, conclude, sustained, analytical, perspective

  Reason: feeds_into
  Rationale: Okonkwo + Adeyemi: English composition skills (planning, paragraphing, evidence-based argument) feed into History essay writing. KS2 English writing is the foundation for KS3 History extended writing — but History also requires source evaluation which English doesn't teach.

### ConceptClusters (1)

**HI-KS3-D003-CL001** — Construct evidence-based historical arguments using disciplinary concepts [CURATED] [KEYSTONE]
Type: practice
Concepts: HI-KS3-C004 (Constructing Historical Arguments)
Rationale: Single concept domain; constructing historical arguments is the signature KS3 disciplinary skill — pupils develop extended written responses that use second-order concepts (causation, significance, change) to answer historical questions with a structured, evidenced thesis.
Inspired by: C3 Framework D3.His.1 — gather relevant information from multiple sources while taking into account the origin, authority, structure, context, and corroborative value of the sources

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**HI-KS3-D003-CL001:**
- **Evidence and Argument** (primary): What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Constructing extended written responses that use second-order concepts to answer historical questions with a structured, evidenced thesis is the most direct application of evidence_argument reasoning in the curriculum — pupils must move from source handling to analytical claim-making in a sustained piece of writing.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'
- **Perspective and Interpretation**: Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?
  Why: Using second-order concepts like significance and interpretations in an argument requires pupils to acknowledge that historical judgements are contestable — different historians prioritise different evidence and reach different conclusions, and a strong argument must engage with and rebut alternative interpretations.
  AI instruction: Use the PERSPECTIVE AND INTERPRETATION lens: prompt pupils to identify the author's or actor's viewpoint, consider what information or experience shapes that perspective, look for omissions or contradictions, and compare multiple accounts. Useful questions: 'Who wrote/said this, and why?', 'What might they have left out?', 'How would someone else see this differently?', 'What would change your view?'

### Objectives (3)
- HI-KS3-O008 [statutory]: pupils should be taught to understand historical concepts such as continuity and change, cause and consequence, similarity, difference and significance, and use them to make connections, draw contrasts, analyse trends, frame historically-valid questions and create their own structured accounts
- HI-KS3-O009 [statutory]: pupils should be taught to understand the methods of historical enquiry, including how evidence is used rigorously to make historical claims, and discern how and why contrasting arguments and interpretations of the past have been constructed
- HI-KS3-O010 [statutory]: pupils should gain and deploy a historically grounded understanding of abstract terms such as 'empire', 'civilisation', 'parliament' and 'peasantry'

### Pedagogy Techniques (5)

**Generation Effect**
Asking the learner to produce or recall information before it is shown to them. Self-generated items are retained 20-30% better than passively read items. The act of generation — even unsuccessful generation — deepens subsequent encoding when the answer is revealed.
Evidence: Slamecka & Graf 1978, McNamara & Healy 1995. Effect persists even when generation fails (unsuccessful generation followed by feedback shows better retention than study alone).
Implementation: Before showing the worked example or revealing the formula: 'What do you remember about how [X] works? Say or write it before I show you.' Accept partial and incorrect responses — the generation attempt, not the answer, is the mechanism.

**Interleaved Practice**
Mixing different types of problems or concepts within a session rather than blocked practice (all of one type, then all of another). Interleaving requires the learner to identify the problem type before solving — this discrimination step is the source of its effect.
Evidence: Bjork 2011, Rohrer & Taylor 2007, Rohrer et al. 2015. Effect size d=0.42 over blocked practice. Transfer advantage approximately 30-40% on delayed tests.
Implementation: Mix the current concept with 2-3 previously mastered concepts in the retrieval practice phase of a session. Tell the child: 'You are practising different types of problems — that is what makes you better.' Surface features vary; underlying structure is the same.

**Spaced Practice**
Distributing practice over time rather than massing it in a single session. Creates desirable difficulty through time-based forgetting and subsequent retrieval. The gap between practice sessions is the mechanism — not re-studying, but retrieving after a delay.
Evidence: Ebbinghaus 1885, Cepeda et al. 2006 (meta-analysis, n=317 studies). Effect size d=0.46. Optimal spacing interval increases as retention target increases.
Implementation: Return to a previously taught concept after a gap of 1-21 days (gap increases as mastery grows). Do not re-teach — retrieve only. The system selects spacing interval based on days since last correct response.

**Testing Effect (Retrieval-Only Practice)**
Using low-stakes tests as a learning tool, not just assessment. Retrieving information from memory strengthens memory traces more than restudying the material. Once mastery is established, all further exposure should be retrieval-only (no re-teaching).
Evidence: Roediger & Karpicke 2006, Roediger & Butler 2011. Effect size d=0.50-0.80. Effect is largest when retrieval is effortful but successful. Prior retrieval also enhances future learning of related material.
Implementation: After mastery is established (5+ correct, 80%+ success rate, 2+ session dates), switch to retrieval-only practice for that concept — questions only, no re-study, no worked examples. The spacing schedule continues. Do not re-teach unless mastery drops below threshold.

**Varied Practice (Surface Variation)**
Changing the surface features of practice problems (different contexts, numbers, scenarios, word choices) while keeping the underlying structure the same. Forces the learner to identify the deep structure rather than applying a surface-level pattern match.
Evidence: Schmidt & Bjork 1992, Kornell & Bjork 2008. Primary mechanism for transfer to novel problems. Contrast with blocked practice which improves performance during training but not on transfer tests.
Implementation: Use the same underlying concept but with different surface contexts across practice problems within a session (e.g., fractions with pizzas, then with ribbons, then with time). Do not vary the underlying structure — vary what it is about.
