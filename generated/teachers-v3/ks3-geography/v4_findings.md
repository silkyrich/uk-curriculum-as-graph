# KS3 Humanities Evaluation — Geography AND History

**Teacher:** Ms Folake Adeyemi, KS3 Humanities, Manchester
**Subjects:** Geography (4 domains, 6 concepts) + History (3 domains, 4 concepts)
**Date:** February 2026
**Context:** v4 evaluation — this builds on my earlier Geography-only assessment (teaching_log.md). This is the first time I have evaluated History from the graph.

---

## Executive Summary

The graph is significantly stronger for Geography than for History. Geography has improved since my last review (cross-domain CO_TEACHES links, removal of assessment clusters), but still lacks the case study content and concept granularity needed to generate lessons. History is structurally present but functionally empty — 4 concepts for a subject that covers a thousand years of British history, the Holocaust, world civilisations, and the full apparatus of disciplinary historical thinking. The absence of cross-subject connections between Geography and History is the single biggest structural failure for a humanities teacher, because these subjects are taught by the same people, in the same department, to the same pupils, and the content overlaps constantly.

**Overall rating: Geography 6/10, History 3/10, Cross-subject connections 1/10.**

## Part 1: Geography — What Has Changed Since My Last Review

I covered Geography in detail in my teaching log. Here is the summary with updates.

### What works well

1. **Cross-domain CO_TEACHES links (NEW).** The graph now connects GE-KS3-C007 (Geographical Skills) to every content concept in D003, with rationales specific enough to shape lesson planning. "Choropleth maps of HDI, GDP per capita" for development. "Population pyramids, migration flow maps" for population. This is the most useful structural improvement since v3.

2. **Assessment clusters removed (NEW).** The forced per-topic assessment blocks are gone. Assessment decisions are back where they belong — with the teacher and the department. I designed a synoptic assessment last time; this time the graph does not fight me on it.

3. **Cluster sequencing is correct.** Tectonics first (physical framework), then development and population (human geography), then climate change (requires development understanding for justice arguments). This matches every well-designed KS3 geography scheme I have seen.

4. **Misconception notes are genuinely useful.** "Africa as a single undifferentiated region," "ozone hole confused with greenhouse effect," "development as linear progression" — these are the exact misconceptions I encounter in Year 8 and Year 9. They could directly generate diagnostic questions.

5. **Vocabulary lists are well-pitched for KS3.** Technical terms introduced at the right points, with enough disciplinary specificity to support extended writing.

6. **Prerequisite chains from KS2 are clear.** GE-KS2-C001 (latitude/longitude) feeds into C005 (world regions) and C001 (plate tectonics). GE-KS2-C002 (climate zones) feeds into C003 (climate change). These are the right links and they help with transition planning.

### What still does not work

1. **Concept granularity is too coarse.** 6 concepts across 4 domains for a subject that typically has 6-8 distinct units per year. GE-KS3-C001 (Plate Tectonics) subsumes Earth's structure, plate boundaries, hazard distribution, case studies, and hazard management. GE-KS3-C002 (Global Development) covers GDP through to dependency theory. Each concept is a half-term of teaching, not a lesson or even a week. The teaching weights (all 3) are meaningless at this granularity.

2. **No case studies.** This is the most critical gap for Geography. The NC statutory wording is "detailed place-based exemplars at a variety of scales." Geography IS case studies. I need:
   - Plate tectonics: Haiti 2010 vs Japan 2011 (contrasting earthquake impacts), Montserrat 1995-97 (volcanic), Eyjafjallajokull 2010 (European impact)
   - Development: Nigeria (MIC with inequality), Malawi (LIC), UK regional inequality (North-South divide)
   - Population/urbanisation: Lagos (rapid urbanisation in LIC), Mumbai (megacity challenges), Syrian refugees (forced migration), Polish migration to UK (EU economic migration)
   - Climate change: Maldives (sea level rise), Bangladesh (flooding vulnerability), Arctic (feedback loops), Manchester/local area (urban heat island, flooding)

   The graph provides precisely none of these. The Topics layer gives me 6 "open_slot" case study categories but every single one is empty. An AI trying to generate a lesson from the graph would produce abstract geography with no places in it. That is not geography.

3. **Missing statutory content.** O003 requires "rocks, weathering and soils; weather and climate; glaciation, hydrology and coasts." O004 requires "economic activity in the primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary sectors; the use of natural resources including energy production." None of these have concept nodes. Rivers alone is typically a full half-term at KS3. Coasts is another. These are not minor omissions — they represent roughly 40% of a typical KS3 geography curriculum. The graph covers the "big themes" (tectonics, development, population, climate) but misses the bread-and-butter physical geography that pupils actually spend most time on.

4. **Skills domain needs splitting.** GE-KS3-C007 is doing the work of 4 distinct skill families: cartographic skills, GIS/digital mapping, data handling/statistics, and fieldwork methodology. The cross-domain CO_TEACHES links would be far more useful if they connected specific skill sub-types to specific content — "cartographic skills + tectonics" is different from "data handling + development."

5. **Fieldwork is structurally invisible.** The graph says fieldwork is statutory and links it to content. But there is zero representation of what fieldwork looks like: enquiry questions, data collection methods, sampling strategies, location types. A `FieldworkEnquiry` node type with links to content and skills would be ideal.

6. **No locational knowledge content.** D001 (Locational Knowledge) has one concept (C005: World Regions) and D002 (Place Knowledge) has one concept (C006: Place Depth Study). These are both single-concept domains with minimal content. Locational knowledge is the geographical equivalent of times tables — it needs to be built cumulatively, revisited constantly, and assessed regularly. One concept node does not capture this.

---

## Part 2: History — First Evaluation

This is the first time I have evaluated the History content from this graph. I teach History to Year 8 and Year 9. I am not a History specialist — Geography is my specialism — but I am a competent History teacher and I know what is needed.

### Domain HI-KS3-D001: British History from 1066 to Present

**Concepts:** 2 — HI-KS3-C001 (Power, Monarchy and Democracy), HI-KS3-C002 (Empire, Colonialism and its Consequences)

**Honest reaction:** Two concepts for a thousand years of British history. Two. The NC programme of study specifies FOUR chronological periods (1066-1509, 1509-1745, 1745-1901, 1901-present) plus a local history study and a pre-1066 consolidation study. The graph reduces all of this to "power" and "empire." These are important themes, but they are not the curriculum.

**What is missing:**

- **The Medieval period (1066-1509) as a distinct entity.** The Norman Conquest, Magna Carta, the Black Death, the Hundred Years War — these are a full term of teaching. They appear nowhere as concepts.
- **The Reformation and religious change (1509-1745).** Henry VIII, the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the English Civil War, the Glorious Revolution — the relationship between Church and state is one of the three NC threads ("Church, state and society") and has no concept node.
- **The Industrial Revolution.** Britain transformed from an agricultural to an industrial society. This is a mandatory part of the 1745-1901 period and is not represented.
- **The World Wars.** The NC explicitly names "challenges for Britain, Europe and the wider world 1901 to the present day." WWI, WWII, the welfare state, decolonisation, the Cold War, post-war immigration — none have concept nodes.
- **Social history.** The lives of ordinary people — peasants, workers, women, children, immigrants — are central to the NC's "society" thread. The graph has "power" and "empire" but not "society."

**What works (limited):**

- The two concepts that ARE there are well-written. C001 (Power, Monarchy and Democracy) has a genuine narrative arc from feudal monarchy to parliamentary democracy. C002 (Empire, Colonialism and its Consequences) properly centres the slave trade and decolonisation. The misconception notes are useful — "Magna Carta as establishing democracy" is a real Year 8 mistake.
- The CO_TEACHES relationship between C001 and C002 is correct. Empire and political power are inseparable.
- The Topics layer is actually better than Geography — 10 topics covering all the statutory periods, plus non-European society options and the Holocaust. But topics are shells, not content.

**Can I plan a half-term of History from this graph?** I will try.

**Half-term: The British Empire and Slavery (Year 8, Autumn 2)**

The graph gives me HI-KS3-C002 (Empire, Colonialism and its Consequences) and the topic HI-KS3-TOPIC-004 (Britain 1745-1901). Here is what I would plan:

| Week | Lessons | Content |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | L1-L2 | Why did Britain want an empire? Motives for colonisation — trade, raw materials, power, religion |
| 2 | L3-L4 | The triangular trade — how the slave trade worked, who profited, human consequences |
| 3 | L5-L6 | Life on plantations — primary source analysis, testimony, lived experience |
| 4 | L7-L8 | Resistance and abolition — enslaved people's agency, Equiano, Wilberforce, the abolition movement |
| 5 | L9-L10 | Legacies of empire — how empire shaped modern Britain, migration, the Windrush generation |
| 6 | L11-L12 | Assessment — "Was the British Empire a force for good?" Extended argument using evidence |

**What the graph gave me:** The concept description for C002. Vocabulary. Misconception notes. The CO_TEACHES link to C001 (power structures behind empire). The prerequisite from KS2 (HI-KS2-C005, British Historical Periods).

**What the graph did NOT give me, and without which these lessons cannot exist:**

- **Source material.** History teaching is built on primary sources. I need Olaudah Equiano's autobiography. I need plantation inventories. I need abolition pamphlets. I need photographs of the Windrush. The graph has no source material layer and no mechanism for linking historical sources to concepts. Without sources, you cannot teach history — you can only tell stories.
- **Chronological framework.** The graph has no timeline. C002 covers events from the 1500s to the 1960s with no temporal structure. Pupils need to understand when things happened and in what order. A chronological spine — key dates, periods, turning points — is missing.
- **Multiple perspectives.** Good history teaching requires pupils to encounter different viewpoints. What did enslaved Africans think? What did British merchants argue? What did abolitionists claim? What do historians now debate? The graph mentions "interpretive diversity" in C004 (Historical Arguments) but does not connect it to the substantive content.
- **Sub-topic structure.** "Empire" is not a lesson. "The triangular trade" is a lesson. "Life on a plantation" is a lesson. "Abolition" is a lesson. The graph gives me one concept where I need six.

### Domain HI-KS3-D002: World and Non-European History

**Concepts:** 1 — HI-KS3-C003 (The Holocaust: Understanding Genocide)

**Honest reaction:** The Holocaust is correctly identified as mandatory and sensitively described. The teaching guidance references the Holocaust Educational Trust and Yad Vashem, which is exactly right. The emphasis on gradual escalation of persecution and the spectrum of responses (perpetrator, bystander, resistor, rescuer) reflects current best practice in Holocaust education.

**BUT:** The NC requires "at least one study of a significant society or issue in world history." The graph's only world history concept is the Holocaust. Where are the named NC exemplars?

- Mughal India 1526-1857
- China's Qing dynasty 1644-1912
- Russia c.1800-1989
- USA in the 20th Century
- Aztec/Inca empires c.1500

The graph has topics for some of these (HI-KS3-TOPIC-007 through 010) but they are open slots with no content. A school choosing to teach Mughal India would find zero graph support beyond "this is a topic you might teach." The concepts, timeline, key figures, sources, and connections would all need to come from elsewhere.

**Missing:** The NC also requires study of "at least one non-European society" separately from the world history requirement. The graph has topic slots but no concepts. A pupil studying the Aztec Empire would encounter nothing in the graph about it.

### Domain HI-KS3-D003: Historical Thinking and Disciplinary Skills

**Concepts:** 1 — HI-KS3-C004 (Constructing Historical Arguments) [KEYSTONE]

**Honest reaction:** This is both the best-written concept in the History section and a structural problem.

**What works:** The concept description is excellent. It correctly identifies historical argument as integrating all second-order concepts (cause/consequence, significance, evidence, interpretation, change/continuity). The teaching guidance on thesis-evidence-counterevidence structure is what I would tell a trainee teacher. The fan-out of 4 (meaning it feeds into 4 other concepts) confirms it is rightly marked as a keystone.

**What does not work:** This is one concept doing the work of six. The NC specifies:
- Cause and consequence
- Change and continuity
- Significance
- Evidence and interpretation
- Argument construction

These are DISTINCT second-order concepts, each developed over years. A pupil might be strong at identifying cause and consequence but weak at evaluating significance. They need separate concept nodes so that mastery can be tracked independently and diagnostic questions can target specific skills.

The Epistemic Skills layer has `HistoricalThinking` as a skill type at KS2, but there is no equivalent for KS3 in my context. Geography has 6 GeographicalSkill entries for KS3 (GS-KS3-001 through 006). History should have the same — at least 5 disciplinary skills properly threaded through the content. Currently, the graph treats historical thinking as a single monolithic skill. It is not.

**Prerequisites are correct:** C004 requires KS2 C001 (Cause and Consequence), C002 (Significance), and C003 (Historical Evidence). These are the right foundations. But the graph collapses three distinct KS2 prerequisites into a single KS3 concept. That is a regression, not a progression.

## Part 3: Cross-Subject Connections — The Missing Layer

This is where I have the strongest feelings. I teach Geography AND History. My pupils make connections between them constantly, because the subjects are about the same world. The graph does not model a single cross-subject connection.

### Connections that exist in my teaching but NOT in the graph

1. **Empire and Development.** HI-KS3-C002 (Empire, Colonialism and its Consequences) and GE-KS3-C002 (Global Development and Inequality) are the SAME STORY told from different disciplinary perspectives. History asks "what happened and why?" Geography asks "what is the spatial pattern today and why?" Colonialism is the answer to "why is development uneven" — it is right there in the Geography concept description. But there is no CO_TEACHES or ALIGNS_TO link between the two subjects.

2. **Migration — historical and geographical.** The Geography concept C004 covers migration as a contemporary process. The History concept C002 covers migration as a consequence of empire and decolonisation. When I teach the Windrush generation in History, I connect directly to push/pull factors from Geography. When I teach Syrian refugees in Geography, I connect to 20th-century conflict from History. No cross-subject link exists.

3. **Climate and geological change.** Geography C003 (Climate Change) and C001 (Plate Tectonics) have deep historical dimensions — the Little Ice Age, the 1815 eruption of Tambora and the "year without a summer," historical responses to natural disasters. History C001 mentions the Medieval period when the Black Death was exacerbated by climate stress. None of this is modelled.

4. **Power and political geography.** Who draws borders? Why is Africa's political map the way it is? The Berlin Conference of 1884-85 is both a historical event and the explanation for many of Africa's current political geography challenges. History C002 and Geography C002 intersect directly here.

5. **The Holocaust and place.** Where did it happen? Why did geography matter? Ghettos, deportation routes, camp locations, escape routes — these are geographical as well as historical. The graph treats the Holocaust as purely historical with no spatial dimension.

6. **Source skills and geographical skills.** History C004 (Constructing Arguments from Evidence) and Geography C007 (Skills: Maps, GIS, Fieldwork) are both disciplinary methodologies. They share a common foundation: the ability to evaluate evidence critically, use multiple sources, and construct reasoned arguments. There is no cross-subject skills link.

### Why this matters for content generation

An AI generating a Geography lesson on "Global Development and Inequality" without knowing about the History concept on colonialism will produce content that treats development patterns as if they just happened. It will miss the historical causation entirely. Similarly, an AI generating a History lesson on the British Empire without knowing about the Geography concept on development will miss the spatial patterns of imperial exploitation. Both lessons will be weaker than they need to be.

If this platform is generating content for humanities departments — and most secondary schools teach Geography and History through a single department — it needs cross-subject links. Not optional, not "nice to have." Essential.

### Recommendation: Cross-Subject CO_TEACHES

Create bidirectional CO_TEACHES relationships:
- HI-KS3-C002 (Empire) <-> GE-KS3-C002 (Development) — Reason: `shared_context`. Rationale: Colonial history explains current patterns of global development and inequality; development geography provides the evidence base for the enduring consequences of empire.
- HI-KS3-C002 (Empire) <-> GE-KS3-C004 (Population/Migration) — Reason: `feeds_into`. Rationale: Historical patterns of migration (slave trade, colonial labour, Windrush, post-colonial migration) explain current population distributions and multicultural communities studied in Geography.
- GE-KS3-C003 (Climate Change) <-> HI-KS3-C001 (Power/Democracy) — Reason: `shared_context`. Rationale: Climate change is a political issue requiring democratic action; historical understanding of how political systems respond to crises informs contemporary climate governance debates.
- HI-KS3-C004 (Historical Arguments) <-> GE-KS3-C007 (Geographical Skills) — Reason: `shared_context`. Rationale: Both are disciplinary methodologies requiring evidence evaluation, source analysis, and reasoned argument construction. Cross-pollination strengthens both.

## Part 4: Can the Graph Generate Content?

### Geography

**Lesson content (interactive lessons, activities):** Partially. The graph can generate a lesson STRUCTURE — concept sequence, vocabulary, misconception-aware questions. But it cannot generate a geography LESSON because it has no case studies, no maps, no data, no images. A geography lesson about plate tectonics without a case study is like a cooking lesson without ingredients. The structure is there but the substance is not.

**Test content (diagnostic assessment):** Yes, this is the strongest capability. The misconception notes are specific enough to generate good distractors for multiple choice. "The ozone hole causes global warming" is a real misconception that becomes a real distractor. "Africa is a country" is a real misconception that becomes a diagnostic question. I could see the graph generating useful formative assessment from what it currently contains.

**Teaching resources (slides, case study packs):** No. Slides need images, maps, data tables, and case study content. The graph has none of these. A slide deck generated from the graph would be a series of text definitions and vocabulary lists. That is a glossary, not a lesson.

### History

**Lesson content:** No. History lessons require primary sources, timeline context, and multiple perspectives. The graph has none. You cannot teach the English Civil War from a concept description that mentions it as one example among twenty. The granularity is orders of magnitude too coarse.

**Test content:** Partially. The misconception notes (Magna Carta as democracy, empire as simple good/bad) could generate diagnostic questions. But History assessment requires extended writing, source analysis, and evaluation — all of which need actual historical sources the graph does not provide.

**Teaching resources:** No. History resources are source packs, timelines, historical images, structured debate materials. The graph cannot generate any of these.

### Cross-subject content

**Cannot generate at all.** No cross-subject links means the graph cannot support a humanities department's integrated planning. It cannot generate a Year 8 "Empire" topic that draws on both Geography and History simultaneously, which is how many schools actually teach it.

---

## Part 5: What the Graph Does Well (Credit Where Due)

I do not want to be entirely negative. The graph has genuine strengths that other curriculum resources lack:

1. **Prerequisite chains are valuable.** Knowing that KS3 Geography requires KS2 latitude/longitude and climate zones allows genuine transition planning. My Geography department can tell the KS2 feeder schools: "make sure they know grid references and the major climate zones." That is directly useful.

2. **Misconception notes are expert-level.** These are not generic — they are the specific mistakes Year 8 and Year 9 pupils actually make. They could generate excellent diagnostic questions right now, without any other changes to the graph.

3. **The CO_TEACHES web for Geography D003 is genuinely useful for planning.** Seeing that all four content concepts co-teach with each other, and that skills connect to all of them, validates the integrated approach that good geography departments already use and helps less experienced teachers see the connections.

4. **Vocabulary lists are well-pitched.** Disciplinary vocabulary at KS3 level, with enough range to support extended writing. These could be extracted and used as-is for a department vocabulary policy.

5. **The learner profile data is surprisingly useful.** "Academic_peer" tone, "academic_critical" feedback, "no gamification," "engage with argument quality" — these match exactly how I want AI to interact with KS3 pupils in Humanities. It respects the disciplinary register.

6. **Cluster sequencing is sound.** For Geography, the three-cluster sequence (tectonics -> development/population -> climate) is defensible and I would not change it. For History, the two clusters in D001 (power -> empire) are correctly ordered.

---

## Part 6: Priority Recommendations (Ranked)

### Must-fix (without these, the graph cannot generate Geography or History content)

1. **Break concepts into sub-concepts.** Geography needs ~20 concepts, not 6. History needs ~15 concepts, not 4. Each current concept is a multi-week unit, not a teachable chunk. This is the single most important structural change.

2. **Add case study content.** Geography needs at least 2 contrasting case studies per concept, with metadata (country, scale, development level, date, which concepts they serve). History needs period-specific content for each of the 4 chronological periods. Empty topic slots are not enough.

3. **Add cross-subject CO_TEACHES links** between Geography and History. At minimum: Empire <-> Development, Empire <-> Migration, Historical Arguments <-> Geographical Skills. These are not optional for humanities teaching.

4. **Add History epistemic skills.** KS3 History needs at least 5 disciplinary skills (cause/consequence, significance, evidence/interpretation, change/continuity, argument construction) threaded through content, matching the 6 GeographicalSkills already in the Geography layer.

### Should-fix (significantly improves content generation quality)

5. **Add missing statutory Geography content.** Rivers, coasts, glaciation, weather/climate (beyond climate change), economic sectors, energy/resources. These represent ~40% of a typical KS3 geography course.

6. **Split Geography skills concept.** C007 should become 4 skill sub-concepts: cartographic, GIS/digital mapping, data handling, fieldwork. The cross-domain CO_TEACHES links become far more useful when they connect specific skill types to specific content.

7. **Add a source material layer for History.** Link primary sources (documents, images, artefacts) and secondary sources (historians' interpretations) to content concepts. Without sources, AI cannot generate History content. Period.

8. **Add chronological spine for History.** Key dates, periods, and turning points as properties or nodes. History without chronology is not history.

### Nice-to-have (refinements for experienced users)

9. **Add skill_progression property to CO_TEACHES.** Indicate whether skills are being introduced, practised, or extended at each connection point.

10. **Add FieldworkEnquiry node type.** Link enquiry questions, data collection methods, and location types to content and skills.

11. **Add NGSS Earth Sciences alignment.** ESS2.B (Plate Tectonics), ESS3.D (Global Climate Change), ESS3.B (Natural Hazards) all overlap with KS3 Geography. Currently 0 ALIGNS_TO relationships exist. The C3 Framework for Social Studies would be the proper US comparison for both Geography and History but is not in the graph at all.

---

## Part 7: Messages for Colleagues

### To Osei (Science):
The plate tectonics overlap between Geography and Science is significant. I teach GE-KS3-C001 (Plate Tectonics and Geological Processes); you presumably teach the same content in KS3 Earth Science. Are our concepts connected in the graph? Because they are not in my context file. Our departments need to coordinate — I do not want to teach convection currents if you have already covered them in Physics, and you do not want to teach volcanic case studies if I have already done them. Cross-subject links between Science and Geography are as important as the Geography-History links I am requesting. Also: does the Science graph have the NGSS Earth Sciences alignment? ESS2.B (Plate Tectonics) should be connected to my Geography content.

### To Okonkwo (English):
Literacy in Humanities is my biggest non-content concern. History at KS3 requires extended writing — argument essays, source analysis, structured debate. Geography requires structured analytical paragraphs and report writing. The learner profile says "short-form analytical responses (100-200 words)" but KS3 History expects 500-800 word essays by Year 9. Does the English graph model the reading-writing connection in a way that supports cross-curricular writing? Also: History needs comprehension of complex non-fiction texts (primary sources, historical accounts). Does the English graph support non-fiction reading at KS3 level? And can the graph generate a "model text" for a History essay or a Geography report? That would be genuinely useful for my department.

### To Henderson (Maths/Data):
Geography at KS3 is surprisingly data-heavy. Population pyramids, development indicators (GDP, HDI, life expectancy), climate graphs, statistical mapping. The epistemic skill GS-KS3-006 (Analysing and presenting geographical data) specifically requires "graphs, thematic maps, choropleth maps and statistical summaries." Do the Year 2 maths concepts feed forward into the kind of data handling my KS3 geographers need? I am also curious about whether the graph connects maths data handling to geographical/scientific data handling — because a child who can read a bar chart in maths should be able to read a population pyramid in geography, and I want to know if the graph models that transfer.

---

## Conclusion

The graph is a structurally sound curriculum map for Geography, albeit with serious content gaps. For History, it is a skeleton that needs substantial development before it can support teaching, let alone content generation. The absence of cross-subject connections between Geography and History is the most significant blind spot for a humanities department.

If forced to choose one improvement, I would choose **cross-subject CO_TEACHES links**. They are cheap to implement (relationships, not new nodes), they unlock humanities department planning, and they would immediately improve any content generated for either subject. Geography and History are not separate subjects in a child's education — they are different lenses on the same world. The graph needs to model that.
