## 1. Initial Observations on the Graph Data

I last reviewed this graph data when I was planning a Year 8 term and wrote a fairly blunt assessment. I said the concept granularity was too coarse, the assessment clusters were wrongly designed, the skills domain should not be standalone, and the whole thing lacked case studies and fieldwork guidance. I stand by all of that. But the graph has changed since then, and some of those changes respond directly to the concerns I raised. Let me walk through what is different.

**What has changed:**

First, the assessment clusters are gone. Last time I had GE-KS3-D003-CL004, a three-lesson assessment block dedicated solely to climate change. I rejected it outright and replaced it with a synoptic assessment across all four content themes. The graph now has three clusters in D003 (CL001, CL002, CL003) and one in D004 (CL001), all typed as either "introduction" or "practice." No assessment clusters at all. This is a significant improvement. It removes the weakest part of the previous structure and leaves assessment decisions where they belong: with the teacher and the department.

Second, and this is the change I am most interested in, there are now formal cross-domain CO_TEACHES relationships linking GE-KS3-C007 (Geographical Skills: GIS, Maps and Fieldwork) in D004 to every single content concept in D003. The graph now explicitly says that skills and content are connected. Last time I wrote: "Make the Skills domain (D004) a cross-cutting thread, not a standalone domain. The graph should represent skills as embedded in content." The cross-domain CO_TEACHES links are a step in that direction. Each link has a rationale -- and I notice one of them quotes me directly: "Adeyemi: 'Topics are not silos.'" That made me laugh. At least someone is reading the feedback.

Third, the within-domain CO_TEACHES for D003 are now fully enumerated. Every pairing of the four content concepts has bidirectional co-teach links -- all six pairings. This is more explicit than last time and I appreciate seeing the full web. There is also a cross-domain link from C007 to GE-KS3-C006 (Place Depth Study) in D002, which I am not planning this year but which confirms skills feed into place studies.

**What has NOT changed:**

The concept count is still five. The granularity is still too coarse. GE-KS3-C001 (Plate Tectonics and Geological Processes) is still a single node that subsumes plate boundaries, the rock cycle, tectonic hazards, and hazard management. GE-KS3-C002 (Global Development and Inequality) still covers everything from GDP to colonialism to dependency theory. The teaching weights are still all set to 3 across the board. There are still no case study suggestions, no fieldwork activity nodes, no sub-concept breakdowns. These remain the fundamental limitations.

The cluster rationales read like decisions made by someone who understands KS3 geography, not like algorithmic output. The NGSS and C3 Framework inspirations are noted but do not drive the structure in any distracting way.

**Overall first impression:** The graph has improved where I criticised it most (assessment clusters removed, skills linked cross-domain). The harder structural problems (concept granularity, case studies, fieldwork) remain and probably cannot be fixed without a deeper rethink of how geography is modelled.

## 2. Domain-by-Domain Cluster Analysis

### GE-KS3-D003-CL001: Investigate Plate Tectonics and Its Role in Shaping Landscapes and Hazards

**Type:** introduction | **Concepts:** GE-KS3-C001 | **Sequenced:** first in D003

**Will I follow, adapt, or reject this cluster?** Adapt. Same verdict as last time.

The cluster positions plate tectonics as the opening unit. Correct -- you need plate boundary mechanics before you can discuss why earthquakes devastate Haiti differently from Japan, which bridges to development.

The within-domain CO_TEACHES links (C001-C002, C001-C004) are useful here. When I teach hazard distribution in lesson 3, I will overlay a development map. When I discuss why people live near volcanoes, that is population geography. The CO_TEACHES links validate what I do instinctively and give me permission to make those connections explicit rather than incidental.

**Lesson allocation:** I am giving this 6 lessons for Year 9. Last time I said 5 for Year 8, but Year 9 pupils can handle more depth. The rock cycle and geological timescales, which I cut last time, deserve proper treatment at this level.

- Lesson 1: Earth's structure, convection currents, plate movement
- Lesson 2: Types of plate boundary -- convergent, divergent, transform
- Lesson 3: Global distribution of earthquakes and volcanoes (map skills from C007 embedded)
- Lesson 4: Tectonic hazard case study 1 -- LIC context (e.g. Nepal 2015)
- Lesson 5: Tectonic hazard case study 2 -- HIC context (e.g. Japan 2011), comparative analysis
- Lesson 6: Living with hazards -- responses, preparation, why people stay

**On the cross-domain CO_TEACHES (C007 to C001):** The rationale says pupils use "mapping and data analysis to study earthquake distribution patterns." That undersells it. In this unit I will use atlas work, GIS (USGS earthquake data), satellite imagery, and OS map interpretation. The cross-domain link tells me THAT skills connect to tectonics but not WHICH skills or HOW. A sentence-level rationale is not a skill-to-content matrix. Still, having the link at all is better than not having it.

**On removing the assessment cluster:** CL004 is gone, leaving a clean three-cluster sequence with no forced assessment points. Unambiguously better. I will build my own low-stakes knowledge check at the end of this unit rather than a full assessment cluster.

**Gaps:** No case studies suggested. No rock cycle or geological timescale sub-concepts. No mention of weathering, which O003 requires. The concept description mentions "rocks and the rock cycle" in the teaching guidance but C001 does not explicitly include it. I am adding it anyway because the statutory objective demands it.

### GE-KS3-D003-CL002: Analyse Global Development, Inequality, Population and Urbanisation

**Type:** practice | **Concepts:** GE-KS3-C002, GE-KS3-C004 | **Sequenced after:** CL001

**Will I follow, adapt, or reject this cluster?** Follow, with internal splitting.

This is the strongest cluster in the set. You cannot teach the demographic transition model without understanding development levels, and you cannot explain urbanisation in Lagos without Nigeria's development trajectory. The C002-C004 CO_TEACHES pairing is the tightest in D003. But C002-C001 and C004-C001 also pay off: why do LICs suffer more from tectonic disasters? Why do millions live in megacities in seismic zones (Tokyo, Istanbul)? The CO_TEACHES web tells me to keep making these connections, and it is right.

**Lesson allocation:** 8 lessons for Year 9. This is the largest unit because it covers two concepts and I want depth.

- Lesson 7: What is development? Indicators, HDI, GDP, limitations (GIS: choropleth mapping of HDI)
- Lesson 8: Global patterns of development -- why is development uneven?
- Lesson 9: Causes of uneven development -- historical, geographical, political factors
- Lesson 10: Case study -- Nigeria (MIC with internal inequality)
- Lesson 11: Population structure -- pyramids, demographic transition model
- Lesson 12: Urbanisation -- push/pull factors, megacity growth (case study: Lagos or Mumbai)
- Lesson 13: Migration -- types, causes, consequences (case study: Syrian refugees / Mediterranean migration)
- Lesson 14: Connections and assessment -- how development, population and urbanisation interact

**On the cross-domain CO_TEACHES (C007 to C002 and C007 to C004):** The rationales here are the most useful of the four cross-domain links. "Choropleth maps of HDI, GDP per capita" and "population pyramids, migration flow maps, census data analysis" are concrete enough to shape my lesson design for lessons 7 and 11. This is the cluster where the cross-domain links add the most planning value.

**Gaps:** No case study suggestions. I need contrasting country studies for development (Nigeria and Malawi), contrasting city studies for urbanisation (Lagos and London), and a UK regional inequality case study for a Year 9 class in Manchester (North-South divide, deindustrialisation). The graph has no mechanism for any of this.

### GE-KS3-D003-CL003: Evaluate the Causes and Consequences of Climate Change and Environmental Geography

**Type:** practice | **Concepts:** GE-KS3-C003 | **Sequenced after:** CL002

**Will I follow, adapt, or reject this cluster?** Follow, expanded.

Sequencing is correct. Climate justice arguments depend on understanding global inequality, so climate change must follow development. Year 9 pupils can handle the moral complexity of who caused the problem versus who suffers most.

The C003-C002 CO_TEACHES link is the most pedagogically important within-domain connection. Climate vulnerability maps onto development maps almost perfectly. When I teach about the Maldives or Bangladesh, pupils already have the framework to understand WHY these places are vulnerable. The CO_TEACHES web does its best work here.

**Lesson allocation:** 6 lessons for Year 9. This is a topic where Year 9 pupils have strong opinions and personal engagement (climate strikes, Greta Thunberg's generation). I want to channel that energy into rigorous geographical analysis.

- Lesson 15: The enhanced greenhouse effect -- mechanism, evidence, data interpretation
- Lesson 16: Climate change impacts -- sea level rise, extreme weather, ecosystem disruption
- Lesson 17: Climate vulnerability and justice -- who is most affected and why? (Links to C002)
- Lesson 18: Responses -- mitigation, adaptation, international agreements (COP, Paris Agreement)
- Lesson 19: Local connections -- how is Manchester's climate changing? Urban heat island, flooding risk
- Lesson 20: Extended writing assessment -- "To what extent is climate change a development issue?"

**On the cross-domain CO_TEACHES (C007 to C003):** True but generic. If C007 were broken into sub-concepts (C007a: statistical data interpretation, C007b: GIS and digital mapping, etc.), the cross-domain link could specify WHICH skills apply to climate data -- temperature anomaly graphs, ice core interpretation, satellite imagery of ice retreat. Currently it says "analytical skills" and leaves me to fill in the specifics.

**On removing the assessment cluster:** This is where the removal makes the biggest difference. The old CL004 forced a climate-only assessment. Now I can design lesson 20 as an extended writing piece testing the C003-C002 connection ("To what extent is climate change a development issue?"). That is the kind of synoptic assessment geography departments actually write. The graph's restraint here is welcome.

**Gaps:** No case studies (I need Maldives, Bangladesh, Arctic, local Manchester). Feedback loops -- permafrost, albedo, ocean acidification -- are each significant enough at Year 9 to warrant sub-concept treatment but are buried inside C003.

### GE-KS3-D004-CL001: Use GIS, Maps and Fieldwork Methods to Collect and Communicate Geographical Data

**Type:** practice | **Concepts:** GE-KS3-C007 | **Single cluster in D004**

**Will I follow, adapt, or reject this cluster?** Reject as a standalone unit. Distribute across the year.

My position has not changed: geographical skills are not a bolt-on. The D004 objectives all say "routinely," "in the classroom and the field," "to view, analyse and interpret." These describe what happens in every lesson, not a standalone unit.

The graph has improved here -- the cross-domain CO_TEACHES now connect C007 to all four content concepts, which is structurally correct. But the cluster itself is still a single "practice" type containing one concept. It does not differentiate between map skills, GIS, data handling, and fieldwork, nor does it sequence their development. For Year 9, I need:

- **Autumn term:** Atlas and map skills embedded in tectonics (lesson 3), GIS introduction embedded in development (lesson 7), population pyramid construction embedded in population (lesson 11)
- **Spring term:** Fieldwork preparation (dedicated lesson), fieldwork execution (full day out), fieldwork write-up and data presentation (dedicated lesson)
- **Summer term:** Satellite imagery interpretation embedded in climate change (lesson 15), extended data analysis in the assessment piece (lesson 20)

I am allocating 4 dedicated skills lessons (GIS intro in lesson 7, fieldwork prep/execution/write-up in lessons 21-23) plus skills embedded throughout. The fieldwork enquiry: "How does environmental quality change along a transect from Manchester city centre to the suburbs?" -- connecting C004 (urbanisation), C007 (fieldwork), and the GIS skills introduced earlier.

**On the cross-domain links overall:** They help, but they are all tagged "shared_context" and the rationales are generic. I would like the graph to differentiate: C007-to-C001 is primarily map reading; C007-to-C002 is data handling and GIS; C007-to-C003 is climate data and satellite imagery; C007-to-C004 is population data and fieldwork. The rationales hint at this but do not make it explicit.

## 3. Cross-Domain Planning

The new cross-domain CO_TEACHES links are the most significant structural improvement in this iteration of the graph. Let me evaluate them as a planning tool.

**Does making D004 a cross-cutting methodology domain work?** Yes, in principle. Every scheme of work I have seen, written, or reviewed integrates skills into content units. The cross-domain CO_TEACHES links formalise this at the graph level: "When you are working with C001, you should also be thinking about C007." That is the right message.

**What works:** The rationales are specific enough to be useful -- "choropleth maps of HDI, GDP per capita" for C007-C002, "population pyramids, migration flow maps" for C007-C004, "earthquake distribution patterns" for C007-C001. For an ECT in my department, these rationales would help them think about which skills to embed where.

**What is still missing:**

The links are all "shared_context" with a single skill concept (C007) connecting to everything. This is too blunt. In reality, "geographical skills" breaks down into at least four distinct skill families:

1. Cartographic skills (OS maps, grid references, contours, scale)
2. GIS and digital mapping (layering, spatial analysis, web-based tools)
3. Data handling and statistical skills (graphs, population pyramids, choropleth maps, statistical measures)
4. Fieldwork methodology (enquiry design, sampling, primary data collection, evaluation)

Each content concept draws on a different mix of these skill families. Tectonics is heavy on cartographic skills and GIS. Development is heavy on data handling and GIS. Climate change is heavy on data handling and satellite imagery. Population is heavy on data handling and fieldwork. If C007 were broken into C007a-C007d, the cross-domain links would become genuinely precise planning tools rather than general reminders.

**Connections still missing:**

There is no temporal dimension to the cross-domain links. The graph says C007 co-teaches with all four content concepts equally, but in practice skill demand builds: atlas skills at the start, GIS in the middle, fieldwork and complex data analysis later. A `skill_progression` property on the CO_TEACHES relationship -- indicating whether skills are introduced, practised, or extended at each connection -- would be genuinely powerful. There is also no link from skills to the assessment process, where skills and content converge.

## 4. Overall Assessment

**Usefulness rating: 6 out of 10** (up from 4.5 last time)

The graph has improved meaningfully. Removing assessment clusters and adding cross-domain CO_TEACHES links addressed two of my five major criticisms. The remaining three (concept granularity, case studies, fieldwork) are deeper structural issues that would require significant rearchitecting of the geography layer.

**Top 3 remaining gaps:**

1. **Concept granularity.** Each of the four D003 concepts is a multi-week theme, not a teachable unit. GE-KS3-C001 (Plate Tectonics and Geological Processes) subsumes at least five distinct sub-topics: Earth's structure, plate boundary types, global distribution of hazards, tectonic hazard case studies, and hazard responses/management. Until these are broken out, the teaching weights (all 3) are meaningless and the cluster structures cannot accurately represent lesson-level sequencing. The single D004 concept (C007) similarly subsumes four distinct skill families. The graph needs 15-20 concepts across these two domains to be genuinely useful for planning, not 5.

2. **No case studies.** Geography at KS3 is built on "detailed place-based exemplars at a variety of scales" -- that is the statutory wording from the National Curriculum (objectives O003 and O004). The graph provides zero case study suggestions. Every concept needs at least two contrasting case studies (HIC/LIC, local/global, physical/human). A case study layer or property -- with country, scale, themes covered, and recency -- would transform this from a structural skeleton into a planning tool. The fact that I had to supply all my own case studies for Haiti, Japan, Nigeria, Lagos, Bangladesh, and Manchester means the graph is doing perhaps 40% of the planning work and I am doing 60%.

3. **Fieldwork remains invisible.** The graph correctly identifies fieldwork as statutory and now links it cross-domain to content. But there is still no representation of what fieldwork looks like: enquiry questions, data collection methods, location types, equipment, safety considerations. For an experienced teacher this is manageable. For an ECT or a non-specialist covering geography, the graph's silence on fieldwork is a serious gap. A `FieldworkEnquiry` node type linked to content concepts and skill sub-concepts would be ideal.

**Specific recommendations for improvement:**

1. Break GE-KS3-C001 into sub-concepts: `C001a` (Earth's structure and plate movement), `C001b` (Plate boundary types), `C001c` (Distribution of tectonic hazards), `C001d` (Tectonic hazard case studies), `C001e` (Hazard responses and management). Do the same for C002, C003, C004, and C007.

2. Add a `case_studies` property to each content concept -- a list of suggested place-based exemplars with metadata (country, scale, HIC/LIC/MIC, date, which concepts they illustrate). Even three per concept would be transformative.

3. Differentiate the cross-domain CO_TEACHES rationales by skill family. Instead of "geographical skills applied to climate change study," specify: "Data handling: interpreting temperature anomaly graphs and ice core data. GIS: mapping carbon emissions by country. Satellite imagery: interpreting Arctic ice extent change." This level of specificity would make the cross-domain links genuinely actionable.

4. Add a `skill_progression` or `skill_demand` property to the CO_TEACHES relationships between D004 and D003, indicating whether skills are being introduced, practised, or extended at each content connection point.

5. Represent the missing statutory content from O003. "Rocks, weathering and soils," "glaciation, hydrology and coasts," and "weather and climate" beyond climate change are all required by the National Curriculum and have no concept nodes. These are not minor topics -- rivers alone is typically a full half-term at KS3.

**What I will tell my department:**

The graph gives us a defensible sequencing of the four major KS3 themes and confirms the cross-topic connections we already build into our schemes. Vocabulary lists, misconception notes, and KS2 prerequisite chains are directly useful and can be shared with the ECTs. But we still need to supply our own case studies, design our own fieldwork, break concepts into teachable chunks, and fill in the statutory content the graph does not cover (rivers, coasts, glaciation, weather, economic sectors, energy). The graph is a curriculum map, not a scheme of work.

**Final lesson count for Year 9 (30 lessons):**

| Unit | Lessons | Cluster Reference | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| Restless Earth (Tectonics) | 6 | GE-KS3-D003-CL001 (adapted, expanded) | Correct sequence, insufficient lesson count in graph |
| The Development Gap | 4 | GE-KS3-D003-CL002 first half (adapted) | Good concept pairing, split internally |
| People on the Move (Population, Urbanisation, Migration) | 4 | GE-KS3-D003-CL002 second half (adapted) | Good concept pairing, split internally |
| Fieldwork: Urban Manchester | 3 | GE-KS3-D004-CL001 (rejected as standalone, redistributed) | Dedicated fieldwork block within content sequence |
| Our Changing Climate | 6 | GE-KS3-D003-CL003 (adapted, expanded) | Correct sequence, insufficient lesson count in graph |
| Synoptic connections and revision | 2 | No cluster (teacher-designed) | Cross-theme synthesis |
| End-of-year assessment | 2 | No cluster (teacher-designed) | Synoptic assessment, extended writing |
| Skills embedding | Throughout | GE-KS3-D004-CL001 cross-domain links | GIS, maps, data handling woven into every unit |
| Reserve / enrichment | 3 | -- | Flexibility for current events, depth, catch-up |
| **Total** | **30** | | |

The graph gave me 4 clusters suggesting roughly 12-15 lessons of content. I am planning 30 lessons. The gap between graph structure and classroom reality is smaller than last time but still substantial. For geography specifically, the graph needs more granularity, more place-based content, and a fieldwork representation before it can be a primary planning tool rather than a structural starting point.
