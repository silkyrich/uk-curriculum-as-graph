## Unit 1: Restless Earth — Plate Tectonics and Tectonic Hazards

*Cluster reference: GE-KS3-D003-CL001 (followed for sequencing; expanded from 3 to 5 lessons)*
*Enquiry question: Why does the Earth move, and why do some people live in danger zones?*

---

### Lesson 1: What lies beneath? Earth's structure and plate movement

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | GE-KS3-C001 (Plate Tectonics and Geological Processes) |
| **Skills embedded** | GE-KS3-C007 — atlas work, interpreting diagrams (O005) |
| **Type** | New content |
| **Key vocabulary** | crust, mantle, outer core, inner core, lithosphere, convection current, plate, continental drift |

**Teaching approach:** Begin with an egg analogy — Earth has layers like an egg (shell = crust, white = mantle, yolk = core). Use a cross-section diagram to establish the four layers and their properties. Introduce Alfred Wegener and continental drift: show the jigsaw fit of South America and Africa, matching fossils, matching rock types. Then explain the mechanism — convection currents in the mantle driving plate movement. Pupils annotate a diagram showing how convection cells cause plates to move. Quick atlas task: locate the major tectonic plates and label them on a world map outline. This activates the KS2 prerequisite on latitude/longitude (GE-KS2-C001) and establishes the global framework.

---

### Lesson 2: What happens at plate boundaries?

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | GE-KS3-C001 |
| **Skills embedded** | GE-KS3-C007 — diagram interpretation, annotated sketching (O005) |
| **Type** | New content |
| **Key vocabulary** | convergent, divergent, transform, subduction, oceanic plate, continental plate, fold mountains, ocean trench, mid-ocean ridge |

**Teaching approach:** Direct instruction on the three types of plate boundary using animated diagrams (I use the BBC Bitesize and BGS animations). For each boundary type: what happens, what landforms are created, and one real-world example (Himalayas for convergent, Mid-Atlantic Ridge for divergent, San Andreas Fault for transform). Pupils create a summary table with diagrams, descriptions and examples. Address the common misconception that plates move fast — emphasise centimetres per year over millions of years. Homework: label a world map with specific plate boundaries they have studied.

---

### Lesson 3: Where in the world? The distribution of earthquakes and volcanoes

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | GE-KS3-C001 |
| **Skills embedded** | GE-KS3-C007 — map interpretation, pattern identification, atlas work (O005, O006) |
| **Type** | New content / practice |
| **Key vocabulary** | distribution, Ring of Fire, seismic zone, hotspot, pattern, correlation, Pacific Plate |

**Teaching approach:** Give pupils a blank world map and two sets of dot stickers — red for volcanoes, blue for earthquakes. Using an atlas or data table, they plot the locations of 20 major earthquakes and 15 major volcanoes. Then overlay a transparency of tectonic plate boundaries. The pattern is immediately visible: earthquakes and volcanoes cluster along plate boundaries, especially the Pacific Ring of Fire. Class discussion: why is the middle of plates generally quiet? What about hotspot volcanoes (Hawaii) — do they break the pattern? This is a core geographical skill — identifying and explaining spatial patterns from map evidence. Pupils write a paragraph describing and explaining the distribution, using evidence from their map.

---

### Lesson 4: Living on the edge — Earthquake case studies

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | GE-KS3-C001, GE-KS3-C002 (co-teach: tectonics and development link) |
| **Skills embedded** | GE-KS3-C007 — data interpretation, comparison skills (O005, O008) |
| **Type** | Practice / application |
| **Key vocabulary** | magnitude, epicentre, Richter scale, primary effects, secondary effects, response, HIC, LIC, vulnerability, resilience |

**Teaching approach:** Compare two earthquakes of similar magnitude in contrasting development contexts: Haiti 2010 (magnitude 7.0, 230,000+ deaths, LIC) and Japan 2011 (magnitude 9.0, 18,000 deaths, HIC). Pupils work in pairs — one researches Haiti, the other Japan — using structured data sheets with prompts (location, magnitude, deaths, economic damage, response time, building standards). Then they compare. The core geographical question: why did a weaker earthquake in Haiti cause far more deaths than a stronger one in Japan? This directly links C001 (tectonics) to C002 (development) via the CO_TEACHES relationship — the physical hazard is the same, but the human geography (wealth, infrastructure, governance) determines the impact. This is one of the most powerful lessons in KS3 Geography.

---

### Lesson 5: Why do people live near volcanoes?

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | GE-KS3-C001, GE-KS3-C004 (co-teach: tectonics and population link) |
| **Skills embedded** | GE-KS3-C007 — evaluating evidence, constructing geographical arguments (O005) |
| **Type** | Practice / consolidation |
| **Key vocabulary** | volcanic hazard, fertile soil, geothermal energy, tourism, risk perception, eruption prediction, monitoring, evacuation |

**Teaching approach:** Begin with the puzzle: if volcanoes are dangerous, why do 800 million people live within 100km of an active volcano? Use the case study of Mount Nyiragongo (DRC) or Mount Merapi (Indonesia) to explore the factors: fertile volcanic soils for farming, geothermal energy, mineral deposits, tourism, and the fact that eruptions are infrequent so the risk feels distant. Pupils conduct a decision-making exercise: would you live on the slopes of Mount Merapi? They weigh up the costs and benefits, considering the population pressure (C004 link) that means people often have no choice. End with a brief look at volcano monitoring and prediction — what can science do to reduce the risk? This consolidates the tectonics unit while bridging to the human geography that follows.

---

## Unit 2: The Development Gap

*Cluster reference: GE-KS3-D003-CL002 (first half — Development component)*
*Enquiry question: Why are some countries richer than others, and does it have to be this way?*

---

### Lesson 6: How do we measure development?

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | GE-KS3-C002 (Global Development and Inequality) |
| **Skills embedded** | GE-KS3-C007 — data interpretation, evaluating indicators (O005, O007) |
| **Type** | New content |
| **Key vocabulary** | development, GDP, GNI, HDI, life expectancy, literacy rate, indicator, economic, social, composite |

**Teaching approach:** Start with a provocation: show two photographs of children's bedrooms from the "Where Children Sleep" project by James Mollison — one from the UK, one from a low-income country. What can we infer about the lives of these children? This motivates the need for measurement. Introduce GDP, GNI per capita, life expectancy, literacy rate and HDI. For each indicator, discuss what it measures, its strengths and its limitations (GDP ignores inequality within a country; life expectancy says nothing about quality of life; HDI is composite but still a simplification). Pupils rank a set of 8 countries using different indicators and discover that the ranking changes depending on which measure you use. This develops the critical insight that development is contested and multidimensional.

---

### Lesson 7: Mapping the global development gap — GIS lesson

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | GE-KS3-C002, GE-KS3-C007 (GIS introduction) |
| **Skills embedded** | GE-KS3-C007 — GIS skills (O007), thematic mapping |
| **Type** | New content (GIS) / practice (development) |
| **Key vocabulary** | GIS, choropleth map, thematic map, data layer, spatial pattern, Global North, Global South, classification |

**Teaching approach:** This is the dedicated GIS introduction lesson. Pupils use a GIS platform (Gapminder, ArcGIS Online, or Worldmapper depending on school IT) to create a choropleth map of HDI by country. They manipulate the data layers — switching between GDP, life expectancy and HDI — and observe how the patterns change. Key geographical question: what pattern do you notice? Where is the divide? Introduce the terms Global North and Global South as descriptive (not explanatory) categories. Discuss why "developing/developed" is problematic vocabulary (see misconception notes from graph). Pupils take screenshots of their maps and annotate them with observations. This satisfies O007 (use GIS to view, analyse and interpret places and data) in a meaningful geographical context rather than as a technical exercise.

---

### Lesson 8: Why is development uneven? Causes and consequences

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | GE-KS3-C002 |
| **Skills embedded** | GE-KS3-C007 — evaluating multiple sources (O005) |
| **Type** | New content / practice |
| **Key vocabulary** | colonialism, trade, debt, landlocked, resource curse, fair trade, aid, dependency, investment, infrastructure |

**Teaching approach:** Structured enquiry into the causes of uneven development. Use a card sort with 12 factors grouped into categories: historical (colonialism, slave trade), geographical (climate, landlocked, resource endowment), economic (unfair trade rules, debt), and political (corruption, conflict). Pupils rank the factors by importance for a specific country case study — I use Nigeria, which illustrates oil wealth alongside poverty, colonial legacy, internal inequality, and rapid economic growth. Introduce the concepts of aid, trade and debt as mechanisms that can either help or hinder development. Brief evaluation: is aid always helpful? (Link to dependency theory vs modernisation theory at an accessible level.) This builds toward the development-climate link in Unit 4 (CO_TEACHES: C002 and C003).

---

### Lesson 9: Can the gap be closed? Solutions to inequality

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | GE-KS3-C002 |
| **Skills embedded** | GE-KS3-C007 — constructing arguments from evidence (O005) |
| **Type** | Practice / consolidation |
| **Key vocabulary** | fair trade, microfinance, intermediate technology, sustainable development, Sustainable Development Goals, NGO, bilateral aid, bottom-up, top-down |

**Teaching approach:** Evaluate different approaches to closing the development gap. Introduce the UN Sustainable Development Goals as a framework. Compare top-down approaches (large infrastructure projects, government aid programmes) with bottom-up approaches (microfinance, intermediate technology, community projects). Use a specific case study: WaterAid in Malawi (bottom-up, clean water provision) vs a large dam project (top-down, but displaces communities). Pupils write an extended answer: "Which approach is more likely to reduce the development gap? Use evidence from case studies to support your argument." This develops the evaluative skills that O003 and O004 require and links to economic sectors content (primary → secondary → tertiary) embedded within the development discussion.

---

## Unit 3: People on the Move — Population, Urbanisation and Migration

*Cluster reference: GE-KS3-D003-CL002 (second half — Population component) + GE-KS3-D004-CL001 (fieldwork)*
*Enquiry question: Where is everyone going, and what happens when they get there?*

---

### Lesson 10: 8 billion and counting — Global population

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | GE-KS3-C004 (Population, Urbanisation and Migration) |
| **Skills embedded** | GE-KS3-C007 — data interpretation, population pyramids (O005) |
| **Type** | New content |
| **Key vocabulary** | population, birth rate, death rate, natural increase, infant mortality, population pyramid, demographic transition model, dependency ratio, ageing population |

**Teaching approach:** Start with the big number: 8 billion people. Show Hans Rosling's "200 Countries, 200 Years" Gapminder animation to visualise population growth over time. Then move to population structure: give pupils population pyramids for the UK, Nigeria and Japan. In pairs, they describe the shape and infer what it tells them about birth rates, death rates, life expectancy and dependency. Introduce the Demographic Transition Model as a simplified framework — but immediately flag its limitations (see misconception notes: it was based on European experience and does not fit all countries). Connect to the prerequisite from KS2 (GE-KS2-C004, Settlement and Economic Geography) by asking: "What did you learn about where people live and why?" Link to development: why do HICs have ageing populations while LICs have youthful ones?

---

### Lesson 11: Megacities — Urbanisation in Lagos

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | GE-KS3-C004, GE-KS3-C002 (co-teach: population and development) |
| **Skills embedded** | GE-KS3-C007 — satellite image interpretation, OS map comparison (O006, O007) |
| **Type** | New content / practice |
| **Key vocabulary** | urbanisation, rural-to-urban migration, megacity, push factor, pull factor, squatter settlement, informal economy, sanitation, infrastructure |

**Teaching approach:** Focus case study on Lagos, Nigeria — one of the world's fastest-growing cities. Use satellite imagery (Google Earth timelapse) to show Lagos's physical expansion over 30 years. Discuss push factors (rural poverty, lack of services, farming difficulties) and pull factors (jobs, education, healthcare, entertainment). Examine life in Makoko — the "floating slum" — using photographs and video clips. What challenges do residents face? What opportunities does Lagos offer? Why do people keep coming despite the challenges? Compare briefly with urbanisation in London (counter-urbanisation, gentrification, the opposite trend). The CO_TEACHES link between C004 and C002 is central here: urbanisation in LICs is driven by the development gap between rural and urban areas.

---

### Lesson 12: On the move — Migration and refugees

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | GE-KS3-C004 |
| **Skills embedded** | GE-KS3-C007 — interpreting flow maps, evaluating sources (O005) |
| **Type** | New content / practice |
| **Key vocabulary** | migration, immigration, emigration, economic migrant, refugee, asylum seeker, push factor, pull factor, forced migration, voluntary migration |

**Teaching approach:** Distinguish between different types of migration: internal/international, voluntary/forced, economic/political. Use a flow map showing major global migration routes. Case study approach: the Syrian refugee crisis — push factors (civil war, destruction, danger), routes taken, reception in neighbouring countries (Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan) and in Europe. Discuss the human stories as well as the statistics. Second brief case study: Polish migration to the UK post-2004 (economic migration, voluntary, EU free movement). Compare the two: what are the similarities and differences in push/pull factors? Address the misconception that migration is always negative — discuss the benefits (economic contribution, cultural diversity, filling labour shortages) alongside challenges (pressure on services, social tensions). Pupils complete a balanced argument frame.

---

### Lesson 13: Fieldwork preparation — Planning our urban enquiry

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | GE-KS3-C007 (Geographical Skills: GIS, Maps and Fieldwork) |
| **Skills embedded** | O006 (OS map interpretation), O008 (fieldwork planning) |
| **Type** | New content (fieldwork methodology) |
| **Key vocabulary** | hypothesis, transect, systematic sampling, random sampling, primary data, secondary data, risk assessment, environmental quality survey, land use survey |

**Teaching approach:** Introduce the fieldwork enquiry question: "How and why does land use change along a transect from the town centre to the suburbs?" Link explicitly to C004 — this is urbanisation and urban structure investigated through primary data. Use an OS map of the local area to plan the transect route. Discuss data collection methods: land use recording, building height estimation, pedestrian count, environmental quality index. Pupils design their data collection sheets. Discuss sampling: why count pedestrians for 5 minutes at each point rather than just glancing? Why record land use at regular intervals? Address the misconception that data collection is straightforward (see graph guidance) — discuss potential sources of error and how to minimise bias. Complete the risk assessment. This lesson satisfies O006 (OS map interpretation in the field context) and begins O008 (fieldwork planning).

---

### Lesson 14: Fieldwork day

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | GE-KS3-C007, GE-KS3-C004 |
| **Skills embedded** | O006 (OS maps in the field), O008 (fieldwork data collection) |
| **Type** | Practice (practical fieldwork) |
| **Key vocabulary** | transect, land use, environmental quality, pedestrian count, systematic sampling, recording, observation |

**Teaching approach:** Full fieldwork day in the local town/city. Pupils work in groups of 4-5 along a pre-planned transect from the CBD to a residential suburb. At each of 8-10 stopping points they record: dominant land use (retail, office, residential, industrial, open space), building height, pedestrian count (5-minute tally), and an environmental quality score (noise, litter, greenery, building condition). Groups use OS maps to navigate and record grid references for each stopping point. I circulate between groups, checking data quality and asking geographical questions: "Why do you think there are more pedestrians here?" "What does this building tell you about how this area has changed?" Safety is managed through pre-visit, group leaders, mobile phones, and a clear meeting point schedule. Raw data is collected for the next lesson.

---

### Lesson 15: Fieldwork write-up — From data to conclusions

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | GE-KS3-C007, GE-KS3-C004 |
| **Skills embedded** | O007 (GIS for analysis), O008 (analyse and draw conclusions) |
| **Type** | Practice / consolidation |
| **Key vocabulary** | bar chart, line graph, GIS, choropleth, data presentation, analysis, conclusion, evaluation, anomaly, reliability, limitation |

**Teaching approach:** Pupils process their fieldwork data into presentation formats: bar charts for pedestrian counts, annotated maps showing land use zones, and (if ICT access allows) a simple GIS map plotting their data points with colour-coded land use categories. They write a structured report: description of patterns found, explanation linked to geographical theory (Burgess model as a simplified framework — does our town match?), and evaluation of methodology (what went well, what were the limitations, how could we improve the data?). This completes the fieldwork cycle from planning to conclusion and satisfies O008 in full. The evaluation section addresses the C007 misconception about data collection being straightforward.

---

## Unit 4: Our Changing Climate

*Cluster reference: GE-KS3-D003-CL003 (followed for sequencing; expanded from 3 to 4 lessons)*
*Enquiry question: Is climate change the greatest geographical challenge of our time?*

---

### Lesson 16: The science of climate change — The greenhouse effect

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | GE-KS3-C003 (Climate Change and Environmental Geography) |
| **Skills embedded** | GE-KS3-C007 — interpreting climate graphs and data (O005) |
| **Type** | New content |
| **Key vocabulary** | climate, weather, greenhouse effect, greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, methane, atmosphere, radiation, absorption, enhanced greenhouse effect, fossil fuel |

**Teaching approach:** Begin by establishing the crucial distinction between weather and climate — weather is short-term conditions, climate is long-term averages. Then teach the natural greenhouse effect as a positive phenomenon (without it, Earth would be -18C). Use a clear diagram showing solar radiation entering the atmosphere, being absorbed and re-radiated by the Earth's surface, and greenhouse gases trapping some of that re-radiated energy. Then introduce the ENHANCED greenhouse effect — human activities (burning fossil fuels, deforestation, agriculture) increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. Show the Keeling Curve (CO2 measurements from Mauna Loa since 1958) and global temperature graphs. Explicitly address the ozone hole misconception: these are different phenomena with different causes and mechanisms. The KS2 prerequisite on climate zones and biomes (GE-KS2-C002) is activated: pupils already know that different parts of the world have different climates — now they learn that those climates are changing.

---

### Lesson 17: Who is affected? Climate impacts and vulnerability

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | GE-KS3-C003, GE-KS3-C002 (co-teach: climate and development) |
| **Skills embedded** | GE-KS3-C007 — interpreting maps, satellite imagery (O005, O007) |
| **Type** | New content / practice |
| **Key vocabulary** | sea level rise, extreme weather, drought, flooding, ice melt, feedback loop, permafrost, vulnerability, adaptation, small island developing states |

**Teaching approach:** Map the global impacts of climate change: sea level rise affecting low-lying nations (Maldives, Bangladesh, Pacific islands), drought in sub-Saharan Africa, glacier retreat in the Alps and Himalayas, Arctic ice melt, extreme weather events increasing in frequency. Use satellite images to show visible change (Arctic ice extent comparison, glacier retreat photos). Introduce feedback loops with concrete examples: melting permafrost releases methane, which causes more warming; reduced ice cover means less sunlight reflected, which causes more warming. These are counterintuitive for pupils (see misconception notes) so use a simple flow diagram. The critical geographical point: the CO_TEACHES link between C003 and C002 is central. The countries most vulnerable to climate change are often those that have contributed least to causing it and have the least capacity to adapt. This is climate justice — connect directly to the development work from Unit 2.

---

### Lesson 18: What can we do? Responses to climate change

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | GE-KS3-C003 |
| **Skills embedded** | GE-KS3-C007 — evaluating evidence, constructing arguments (O005) |
| **Type** | Practice |
| **Key vocabulary** | mitigation, adaptation, renewable energy, carbon capture, Paris Agreement, COP, carbon footprint, sustainability, geo-engineering, international cooperation |

**Teaching approach:** Introduce the two broad categories of response: mitigation (reducing the causes — cutting emissions, renewable energy, carbon capture) and adaptation (adjusting to the effects — flood defences, drought-resistant crops, managed retreat from coastlines). Give pupils a set of 12 response cards and ask them to classify each as mitigation or adaptation, then rank them by effectiveness and feasibility. Case study: how is the UK responding? (Climate Change Act, net zero target, offshore wind expansion, but also new oil and gas licences). Case study: how is Bangladesh adapting? (Floating schools, cyclone shelters, early warning systems — but limited resources for large-scale adaptation). Brief introduction to international agreements (Paris Agreement, COP process) and why international cooperation is difficult. This builds evaluative geographical thinking.

---

### Lesson 19: Climate change in our backyard — Local connections and synoptic review

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | GE-KS3-C003, GE-KS3-C001, GE-KS3-C002, GE-KS3-C004 |
| **Skills embedded** | GE-KS3-C007 — all skills (O005, O006, O007, O008) |
| **Type** | Consolidation |
| **Key vocabulary** | synoptic, connection, interaction, physical geography, human geography, sustainability, resilience |

**Teaching approach:** Begin with the local scale: how might climate change affect our area? (Flooding risk? Heatwaves? Changes to agriculture? New species arriving?) Use Environment Agency flood maps (GIS — O007) to check local flood risk. Then zoom out to a synoptic review that connects all four units. Give pupils a large sheet of paper and ask them to create a concept map showing the connections between plate tectonics, development, population/urbanisation and climate change. Key connections to draw out: tectonic hazards are worse in LICs (tectonics + development), urbanisation in LICs is driven by development gaps (population + development), climate change disproportionately affects LICs (climate + development), megacities in hazard zones face compound risks (population + tectonics), climate refugees are a new form of migration (climate + population). This synoptic thinking is what distinguishes good KS3 geography from topic-by-topic learning. Pupils revise their concept maps for homework in preparation for the assessment.

## Unit 5: Synoptic Assessment

*Cluster reference: DEVIATION from GE-KS3-D003-CL004 — replaced per-concept climate assessment with synoptic assessment across all domains*

---

### Lesson 20: End-of-unit assessment

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | All: GE-KS3-C001, GE-KS3-C002, GE-KS3-C003, GE-KS3-C004, GE-KS3-C007 |
| **Type** | Assessment |
| **Key vocabulary** | All unit vocabulary |

**Assessment structure (50 min):**

**Section A — Knowledge and understanding (15 marks, 15 min)**
Short-answer questions testing core knowledge from each unit:
1. Name the three types of plate boundary and describe what happens at each. (6 marks)
2. Define GDP and HDI. Give one strength and one limitation of using GDP to measure development. (4 marks)
3. Explain one push factor and one pull factor that cause rural-to-urban migration. (3 marks)
4. What is the enhanced greenhouse effect? (2 marks)

**Section B — Geographical skills (10 marks, 10 min)**
Data interpretation questions:
5. Study the population pyramid for Country X. Describe and suggest reasons for the shape of this pyramid. (4 marks)
6. Study the map showing the distribution of earthquakes. Describe the pattern and explain it using your knowledge of plate tectonics. (4 marks)
7. Study the climate graph. What evidence does it show for climate change? (2 marks)

**Section C — Extended writing (15 marks, 25 min)**
Synoptic question requiring connections between topics:
8. "The effects of natural hazards are determined more by human geography than physical geography." Using case studies you have studied, how far do you agree with this statement? You should consider the role of development, population and responses to hazards in your answer. (15 marks)

This assessment tests all four content concepts and the skills concept in an integrated way. Section C specifically requires pupils to make the CO_TEACHES connections between tectonics, development and population that the graph data highlights. The extended writing question mirrors GCSE-style assessment, preparing pupils for KS4.
