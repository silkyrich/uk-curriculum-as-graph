# CASE Standards Reference (US Curriculum Alignment)

The graph contains US curriculum standards (NGSS for Science, Common Core for Maths) as a comparison data point. The UK and US curricula are broadly similar but structured differently. Use these to identify gaps, alternative framings, or useful pedagogical ideas.
