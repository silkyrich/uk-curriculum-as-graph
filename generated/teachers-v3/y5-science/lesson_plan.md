## Unit A: Light (6 lessons)

### Lesson 1 -- What Do We Need to See?
**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C022 (Light and Vision)
**Type:** Retrieval / new content
**Approach:** Begin with a dark den experience -- pupils enter a blacked-out area and attempt to identify objects. Establish that dark is the absence of light, not a substance. Classify light sources as luminous (produce their own light: sun, torch, candle) versus non-luminous (reflect light: moon, most objects). Address sun safety explicitly (objective O027): never look directly at the sun; discuss UV-blocking sunglasses and eclipse viewers. Correct the misconception that the Moon produces its own light.
**Key vocabulary:** light, dark, light source, luminous, non-luminous, reflect, absence, sun safety, UV

### Lesson 2 -- Shadows and Materials
**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C024 (Shadow Formation)
**Type:** Retrieval / investigation (Working Scientifically: fair testing)
**Approach:** Retrieve Y3 knowledge: shadows form when opaque objects block light. Classify materials as opaque, translucent, or transparent using torches and samples. Conduct a fair test investigation: how does the distance between the light source and the object affect shadow size? Pupils change one variable (distance), measure shadow height, record in a table, and identify the pattern. Discuss shadow shape and why it matches the object (setting up the straight-line model for Lesson 3).
**Key vocabulary:** shadow, opaque, translucent, transparent, light source, block, screen, fair test, variable, measure

### Lesson 3 -- Light Travels in Straight Lines
**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C067 (Light Travels in Straight Lines)
**Type:** New content
**Approach:** The key Y6 concept. Demonstrate using the torch-and-cards experiment: shine a torch through a series of cards with aligned holes -- light only reaches the end if all holes are in a straight line. Misalign one card and the light is blocked. Use a laser pointer (teacher-operated, safely) in a misty room to make the beam visible. Introduce the term "ray" and draw simple ray diagrams showing light travelling from source to object. Address the persistent misconception that light travels from the eye to the object -- use a class discussion to surface and challenge this idea.
**Key vocabulary:** straight line, ray, beam, source, ray diagram, travel, direction, model, align

### Lesson 4 -- Explaining Shadows with Ray Diagrams
**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C067 (Light Travels in Straight Lines), SC-KS2-C024 (Shadow Formation)
**Type:** Application / practice
**Approach:** Revisit the shadow investigation from Lesson 2, now explaining the results using the straight-line model. Pupils draw ray diagrams showing light from a source being blocked by an opaque object, creating a shadow behind it. Explain why the shadow has the same shape as the object -- because light cannot bend around it. Explain why shadows are larger when the object is closer to the light source by drawing diverging rays. Pupils practise drawing and annotating their own ray diagrams. Y6 extension: predict shadow size from a diagram before measuring.
**Key vocabulary:** ray diagram, opaque, shadow, block, straight line, predict, explain, diverge, source, screen

### Lesson 5 -- Reflection and How We See Objects
**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C023 (Reflection of Light), SC-KS2-C067 (Light Travels in Straight Lines)
**Type:** New content / investigation (Working Scientifically: observation and pattern seeking)
**Approach:** Investigate reflection: use mirrors and torches in a darkened room to redirect a beam of light. Challenge pupils to bounce a torch beam around obstacles using mirrors. Discuss that shiny, smooth surfaces reflect light well but ALL objects reflect some light -- that is how we see them. Draw the complete "how we see" model: light from source -> reflects off object -> travels in straight line -> enters eye. Use ray diagrams to show this. Correct the misconception that only mirrors reflect light. Connect to everyday applications: reflective clothing, bicycle reflectors, cat's eyes on roads. Y6 extension: build a simple periscope.
**Key vocabulary:** reflect, reflection, mirror, surface, beam, bounce, eye, image, angle, periscope, ray diagram

### Lesson 6 -- Light Assessment
**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C022, SC-KS2-C023, SC-KS2-C024, SC-KS2-C067
**Type:** Assessment
**Approach:** Short written assessment with three sections: (1) Label a ray diagram showing how we see an object -- light from source, reflection, to eye. (2) Explain why a shadow has the same shape as the object that casts it, using the idea that light travels in straight lines. (3) True or false with corrections -- address common misconceptions (e.g., "We see because light travels from our eyes to objects," "Only shiny things reflect light," "The Moon is a light source"). Peer discussion of answers before teacher collects written work. Identify pupils needing further support before moving on.
**Key vocabulary:** (Consolidation of all Light vocabulary)

## Unit B: Forces and Magnets (5 lessons)

### Lesson 7 -- Contact and Non-Contact Forces
**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C025 (Contact and Non-Contact Forces)
**Type:** Retrieval / new content
**Approach:** Retrieve prior learning: forces are pushes and pulls that can change the speed, direction, or shape of an object. Introduce the organising framework: contact forces (need objects to touch: friction, air resistance, water resistance) versus non-contact forces (act at a distance: gravity, magnetism). Use a two-column sorting activity with everyday examples -- pupils classify scenarios as contact or non-contact. Demonstrate gravity as a non-contact force: drop a ball without touching it. Demonstrate magnetism: attract a paper clip without touching it. Use force arrows on simple diagrams to show direction. Discuss: what force keeps us on the ground?
**Key vocabulary:** force, push, pull, contact, non-contact, gravity, magnetic, friction, air resistance, water resistance, direction, arrow

### Lesson 8 -- Friction Investigation
**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C027 (Friction and Movement on Surfaces)
**Type:** Investigation (Working Scientifically: fair testing -- the core WS lesson of the term)
**Approach:** Set up a full fair test investigation: roll a toy car down a ramp onto different surfaces (carpet, sandpaper, smooth wood, lino, bubble wrap) and measure how far it travels. Pupils identify variables: what are we changing (surface), measuring (distance), and keeping the same (car, ramp angle, release point)? Make predictions before testing. Record results in a table, calculate averages from repeated tests, and draw a bar chart. Conclude: rougher surfaces produce more friction and slow the car down more. Discuss where friction is useful (brakes, shoe grips) and where it is a problem (wear on moving parts). Use force meters to pull objects across different surfaces if time allows.
**Key vocabulary:** friction, surface, rough, smooth, ramp, fair test, variable, measure, distance, force meter, predict, average, bar chart

### Lesson 9 -- Which Materials Are Magnetic?
**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C026 (Magnetic Properties)
**Type:** New content / systematic investigation (Working Scientifically: observation and recording)
**Approach:** Provide a variety of materials (iron nail, copper coin, aluminium foil, steel paper clip, wooden block, plastic ruler, brass key, nickel coin, fabric, glass marble). Pupils predict which will be attracted to a magnet, then test systematically, recording results in a table. Establish the key finding: only iron, nickel, cobalt, and their alloys (steel) are magnetic -- NOT all metals. Address the misconception directly: "Are all metals magnetic? Test a copper coin and an aluminium can." Sort materials into magnetic and non-magnetic. Introduce different types of magnets: bar, horseshoe, ring.
**Key vocabulary:** magnet, magnetic, attract, iron, nickel, cobalt, steel, metal, non-magnetic, bar magnet, horseshoe magnet, predict, test, systematic

### Lesson 10 -- Magnetic Poles and Fields
**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C026 (Magnetic Properties)
**Type:** Investigation / new content (Working Scientifically: pattern seeking)
**Approach:** Investigate magnetic poles: suspend a bar magnet from string -- it settles pointing north-south (compass connection). Bring two magnets together in different orientations: like poles repel, unlike poles attract. Pupils record the pattern. Visualise the magnetic field using iron filings on paper placed over a bar magnet. Investigate whether magnetic force passes through materials: can you move a paper clip through a table, a book, or water using a magnet? Establish that magnets are strongest at the poles, not in the middle. Y6 extension: make a simple compass by magnetising a needle and floating it on water.
**Key vocabulary:** pole, north, south, attract, repel, magnetic field, iron filings, compass, force, distance, through, pattern

### Lesson 11 -- Forces and Magnets Assessment
**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C025, SC-KS2-C026, SC-KS2-C027
**Type:** Assessment / application
**Approach:** Practical stations assessment (20 minutes) plus written task (20 minutes). Station 1: sort force cards into contact and non-contact. Station 2: predict and test whether mystery objects are magnetic. Written task: explain why a car travels further on a smooth surface than a rough surface using the word "friction." Draw force arrows. Explain why a magnet can pick up a paper clip without touching it (non-contact force, magnetic material). Correct a misconception statement: "All metals are attracted to magnets."
**Key vocabulary:** (Consolidation of all Forces vocabulary)

## Unit C: Living Things and Their Habitats (14 lessons)

### Lesson 12 -- Grouping Living Things
**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C029 (Variety of Classification Criteria)
**Type:** Retrieval / new content
**Approach:** Provide sets of organism picture cards (about 20 organisms: mix of mammals, birds, insects, fish, plants, fungi). Challenge groups to sort them into groups -- but give no criteria. Compare the different groupings that emerge: by habitat, by diet, by body covering, by number of legs. Discuss: which grouping is "correct"? Establish that different criteria produce different but equally valid groupings. Use Venn diagrams to show overlapping groups (e.g., "lives in water" and "has legs" -- frog goes in the overlap). Address the misconception that there is only one right way to classify. Introduce the idea that scientists have agreed on a system based on shared characteristics.
**Key vocabulary:** classify, group, criteria, characteristic, similar, different, sort, Venn diagram, organism, feature

### Lesson 13 -- Using Classification Keys
**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C028 (Classification Keys)
**Type:** New content / practice
**Approach:** Introduce branching (dichotomous) keys using a teacher-made example: "Does it have legs? Yes/No" leading to further questions. Model how to follow a key to identify a specimen. Pupils use published keys to identify leaves, minibeasts, or shells collected from the school grounds. Emphasise that good key questions use observable, unambiguous features ("Does it have more than six legs?" not "Is it pretty?"). Progress to a paired activity: use a key to identify 10 unknown organisms from picture cards. Record identifications. Check accuracy against an answer sheet.
**Key vocabulary:** classification key, branching key, dichotomous, identify, characteristic, observable, yes/no, question, specimen, branch

### Lesson 14 -- Making Our Own Classification Keys
**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C028 (Classification Keys), SC-KS2-C029 (Variety of Classification Criteria)
**Type:** Application / fieldwork (Working Scientifically: classification)
**Approach:** Fieldwork lesson (school grounds or local green space). Collect or photograph organisms found in the school habitat. Back in the classroom, pupils work in groups to create their own branching key that could be used to identify the organisms they found. Test each other's keys -- does the key work? Does it lead to the correct organism? Refine questions that are ambiguous. Display completed keys. This is the culminating activity for the classification skills unit: pupils apply both the criteria concept (choosing useful characteristics) and the key concept (structuring yes/no questions logically).
**Key vocabulary:** branching key, criteria, observable, identify, habitat, organism, characteristic, fieldwork, question, accurate

### Lesson 15 -- Carl Linnaeus and the Classification System
**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C058 (Formal Biological Classification)
**Type:** New content
**Approach:** Tell the story of Carl Linnaeus and why scientists needed a universal classification system. Introduce the hierarchy: living things are divided into broad groups -- plants, animals, and micro-organisms. Animals are divided into vertebrates (with backbones: fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals) and invertebrates (without backbones: insects, spiders, worms, snails). Plants are divided into flowering and non-flowering (ferns, mosses, conifers). Create a large wall display showing the classification hierarchy with spaces to add examples over the coming lessons. Discuss: why is a universal system important? (So scientists worldwide can communicate clearly about organisms.)
**Key vocabulary:** classification, Linnaeus, vertebrate, invertebrate, backbone, fish, amphibian, reptile, bird, mammal, flowering plant, non-flowering plant, hierarchy, kingdom

### Lesson 16 -- Classifying Animals: Vertebrates and Invertebrates
**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C058 (Formal Biological Classification)
**Type:** Practice / application (Working Scientifically: classification)
**Approach:** Provide specimen collections or high-quality photographs of diverse animals. Pupils sort them first into vertebrate and invertebrate, then further classify vertebrates into the five groups (fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals) by identifying key characteristics of each group. Discuss difficult cases: is a whale a fish or a mammal? Is a penguin a mammal or a bird? Is a snake an amphibian or a reptile? Use observable characteristics (body covering, breathing, reproduction) to resolve. Address the misconception that habitat determines classification. Emphasise that invertebrates make up 97% of animal species. Add examples to the wall display from Lesson 15.
**Key vocabulary:** vertebrate, invertebrate, fish, amphibian, reptile, bird, mammal, characteristic, classify, backbone, scales, feathers, fur, gills, lungs

### Lesson 17 -- Micro-organisms: Too Small to See
**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C059 (Micro-organisms)
**Type:** New content / practical
**Approach:** Introduce micro-organisms as living things too small to see without a microscope. Three types (at this level): bacteria, viruses, and fungi (including yeasts and moulds). Practical activities: observe bread mould with hand lenses and microscope images; mix yeast with warm water and sugar to observe gas production (bubbles); discuss bacteria in yoghurt-making. Explore helpful micro-organisms (decomposition, digestion, food production) versus harmful ones (food poisoning, illness). Link to hygiene: why do we wash our hands? Connect to the CO_TEACHES link with environmental change (C030): micro-organisms are decomposers that recycle nutrients. Address the misconception that all "germs" are harmful.
**Key vocabulary:** micro-organism, bacteria, virus, fungi, yeast, mould, microscope, decompose, hygiene, helpful, harmful, invisible, living

### Lesson 18 -- Classification Challenge
**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C058 (Formal Biological Classification), SC-KS2-C059 (Micro-organisms)
**Type:** Consolidation / application
**Approach:** Team challenge: each group receives a set of 20 organism cards (including tricky examples: fungi, coral, sea anemone, platypus, whale, bat, penguin). Sort into the correct classification groups: plants (flowering/non-flowering), animals (vertebrates by group / invertebrates), micro-organisms, and fungi. Bonus discussion: why are fungi not plants? (They do not photosynthesise.) Why is coral an animal? (It feeds on other organisms.) Compare group results. Add final examples to the classification wall display. This lesson draws together C058 and C059 and tests whether pupils can apply the Linnaean system independently.
**Key vocabulary:** classify, group, characteristic, fungi, photosynthesise, organism, evidence, justify, hierarchy

### Lesson 19 -- Classification Assessment
**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C028, SC-KS2-C029, SC-KS2-C058, SC-KS2-C059
**Type:** Assessment
**Approach:** Written assessment with three sections: (1) Use a branching key to identify four unknown organisms from descriptions. (2) Given a set of organisms, explain why you would classify a whale as a mammal rather than a fish -- use observable characteristics. (3) Describe two ways micro-organisms can be helpful and two ways they can be harmful. Give one reason why scientists use a classification system. Mark scheme shared with pupils for self-assessment. Identify gaps before moving to life cycles unit.
**Key vocabulary:** (Consolidation of all Classification vocabulary)

### Lesson 20 -- Life Cycles: Mammals and Birds
**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C044 (Comparative Life Cycles)
**Type:** New content
**Approach:** Introduce the concept of a life cycle as a repeating pattern from birth to reproduction. Compare mammal life cycles (e.g., human, dog, elephant): live birth, parental care, growth to maturity, variation in gestation periods. Compare bird life cycles (e.g., robin, chicken, penguin): egg-laying, incubation, hatching, fledgling stage, independence. Draw circular life cycle diagrams for each. Create a comparison table: how are mammal and bird life cycles similar (both involve parental care, growth) and different (live birth vs eggs, internal vs external development)? Discuss: why do mammals and birds both care for their young? (Helpless offspring need protection.)
**Key vocabulary:** life cycle, mammal, bird, live birth, egg, hatch, fledgling, gestation, incubation, parental care, offspring, adult, growth, maturity

### Lesson 21 -- Life Cycles: Metamorphosis in Amphibians and Insects
**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C044 (Comparative Life Cycles)
**Type:** New content / comparison
**Approach:** The dramatic lesson: metamorphosis. Amphibian life cycle (frog): eggs (spawn) -> tadpole (gills, tail, aquatic) -> froglet (legs develop, gills become lungs) -> adult frog. Insect life cycle with complete metamorphosis (butterfly): egg -> caterpillar (larva) -> chrysalis (pupa) -> adult butterfly. Show that the larval stage looks completely different from the adult. Address misconception: a chrysalis is not "resting" -- major body restructuring is happening inside. Compare all four life cycles (mammals, birds, amphibians, insects) on a single comparison chart. If available, observe real frog spawn or caterpillars in the classroom. Y6 extension: incomplete metamorphosis (grasshopper: egg -> nymph -> adult, no pupal stage).
**Key vocabulary:** metamorphosis, amphibian, insect, tadpole, froglet, larva, caterpillar, pupa, chrysalis, spawn, stage, transform, complete, incomplete

### Lesson 22 -- Reproduction in Plants: Sexual and Asexual
**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C045 (Reproduction in Plants and Animals)
**Type:** New content / practical
**Approach:** Distinguish sexual reproduction (two parents, offspring show variation) from asexual reproduction (one parent, offspring genetically identical -- clones). Review sexual reproduction in flowering plants: pollination, fertilisation, seed formation, dispersal (retrieve from earlier KS2 learning of the flowering plant life cycle, C014). Introduce asexual reproduction through practical activities: take cuttings from geraniums or busy lizzies, plant strawberry runners, examine potato tubers sprouting, and garlic bulbs dividing. Discuss why asexual reproduction produces identical offspring while sexual reproduction produces variation. Address misconception: a plant getting bigger is growth, not reproduction.
**Key vocabulary:** reproduction, sexual, asexual, pollination, fertilisation, seed, cutting, runner, tuber, bulb, clone, variation, offspring, parent, identical

### Lesson 23 -- Comparing Reproductive Strategies
**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C045 (Reproduction in Plants and Animals), SC-KS2-C044 (Comparative Life Cycles)
**Type:** Consolidation / application
**Approach:** Drawing together life cycles and reproduction. Create a large comparison matrix: for each organism type (mammal, bird, amphibian, insect, flowering plant), record the life cycle stages, type of reproduction, number of offspring, amount of parental care, and whether offspring look like the adult or undergo metamorphosis. Discuss trade-offs: organisms that produce many offspring (frog: thousands of eggs) usually provide less parental care; organisms that produce few offspring (elephant: one calf) invest heavily in each one. Link to survival: why do different strategies work? Y6 extension: introduce the idea that variation from sexual reproduction is the raw material for natural selection (preview of evolution at KS3).
**Key vocabulary:** reproduction, life cycle, variation, parental care, offspring, survival, strategy, comparison, trade-off, sexual, asexual, metamorphosis

### Lesson 24 -- Environmental Change and Human Impact
**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C030 (Environmental Change and Impact)
**Type:** New content / discussion (Working Scientifically: research using secondary sources)
**Approach:** Explore how environments change: natural changes (seasons, flooding, drought, volcanic eruptions) and human-caused changes (deforestation, pollution, urbanisation, climate change). Case study: hedgerow removal in the UK -- how did removing hedgerows to create larger fields affect bird populations, insects, and small mammals? Trace the effects through a food chain: remove one organism and others are affected. Discuss both positive human impacts (nature reserves, wildlife corridors, reforestation, river clean-ups) and negative ones. Link to the CO_TEACHES connection with micro-organisms (C059): decomposers recycle nutrients, but pollution can kill decomposer communities. Pupils research one environmental issue using books or pre-selected websites and present findings.
**Key vocabulary:** environment, habitat, change, pollution, deforestation, conservation, endangered, extinct, food chain, population, impact, positive, negative, human, natural, adapt

### Lesson 25 -- Living Things Assessment and Consolidation
**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C044, SC-KS2-C045, SC-KS2-C030
**Type:** Assessment / consolidation
**Approach:** Two-part lesson. Part 1 (20 minutes): written assessment covering life cycles (draw and label the life cycle of a frog, explaining what metamorphosis means), reproduction (describe one example of sexual and one of asexual reproduction in plants), and environmental change (explain how removing one organism from a food chain affects others). Part 2 (25 minutes): consolidation carousel -- three tables with different activities. Table 1: match organism cards to their life cycle type. Table 2: "What would happen if..." environmental change scenarios. Table 3: create a poster explaining why variation from sexual reproduction matters for species survival. Pupils rotate through all three. Final plenary: what are the three most important things you have learned about living things this term?
**Key vocabulary:** (Consolidation of all Living Things vocabulary)
