# Teaching Context (from Graph)


## Domain: SC-KS2-D005 — Light
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
The Light domain at KS2 requires pupils to understand light as a physical phenomenon — how it is produced, how it travels and how it interacts with materials. Pupils discover that light travels in straight lines and that we see because light enters the eye, correcting common misconceptions from younger years. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to investigate how shadows are formed and how their size and shape relate to the position of the light source, and to understand reflection as the mechanism by which mirrors and smooth surfaces change the direction of light. Pupils also explore how light is refracted, providing the conceptual foundation for understanding how lenses and optical instruments work.

### Concepts (4)

#### SC-KS2-C022 — Light and Vision
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that light is needed to see — dark is the absence of light. In Year 3, this is the observable phenomenon; in Year 6, it is explained using the model that light travels in straight lines from sources to eyes or via reflection.

**Teaching guidance:** Create a dark den or use a blacked-out area to explore the concept that we need light to see. Demonstrate that in complete darkness we cannot see at all — dark is the absence of light, not a substance. Introduce the idea that we see objects because light from a source reaches our eyes — either directly from a light source (sun, lamp, candle) or after reflecting off objects. Discuss sun safety: never look directly at the sun. Compare objects that produce their own light (luminous — sun, torch, candle) with those that reflect light (non-luminous — moon, most objects).

**Common misconceptions:** The most common misconception is that we can see in complete darkness if we 'wait long enough for our eyes to adjust'. In complete darkness (no light at all), we cannot see anything. Children often believe the Moon produces its own light — it reflects sunlight. Some pupils think darkness is a substance that can be 'pushed away' by light, rather than understanding darkness as the absence of light.

**Key vocabulary:** light, dark, light source, luminous, reflect, shadow, see, eye, torch, candle, sun, absence, visible, darkness, bright, dim

#### SC-KS2-C023 — Reflection of Light
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that light is reflected from surfaces, including mirrors and other reflective materials. In Year 3 this is observed; in Year 6 it is explained using the straight-line travel model.

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate reflection using mirrors, torches and darkened rooms. Show that shiny, smooth surfaces (mirrors, foil, still water) reflect light well, while rough or dark surfaces reflect less light. Use mirrors to redirect a torch beam around obstacles. Introduce the idea that we see most objects because light bounces off them into our eyes — even non-shiny objects reflect some light. Compare reflections in flat mirrors (clear image) with curved mirrors (distorted image). Connect to everyday applications: bicycle reflectors, reflective clothing, cat's eyes on roads.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think that only shiny objects like mirrors reflect light. In fact, all visible objects reflect some light — that is how we see them. Some pupils believe that light only comes from very bright sources and do not recognise that a candle or even a glow-worm is a light source. Children may think reflection only occurs in mirrors, not understanding that water, polished floors and even walls reflect light.

**Key vocabulary:** reflect, reflection, mirror, surface, shiny, smooth, light, bounce, torch, image, beam, direction, reflective, visible, angle

#### SC-KS2-C024 — Shadow Formation
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that shadows are formed when light from a source is blocked by an opaque object. In Year 3, the pattern of shadow size changes is explored. In Year 6, shadow shape is explained using the straight-line travel model.

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate shadows using torches and opaque objects in a darkened area. Explore how shadow size changes with the distance between the light source and the object — closer to the light makes a larger shadow, closer to the screen makes a smaller shadow. Investigate how shadow shape relates to the shape of the object. Classify materials as opaque (blocks all light, creates shadow), translucent (lets some light through, creates faint shadow) or transparent (lets most light through, no shadow). In Year 6, revisit shadows and explain their sharp edges using the model that light travels in straight lines.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think shadows have colour or are reflections of objects rather than areas where light has been blocked. Some pupils believe shadows are always the same size as the object, not understanding how distance from the light source affects shadow size. Children may think transparent objects have no effect on light at all, when in fact they can refract (bend) light passing through them.

**Key vocabulary:** shadow, opaque, translucent, transparent, light source, block, screen, shape, size, dark, bright, edge, outline, torch, distance

#### SC-KS2-C067 — Light Travels in Straight Lines
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

The explanatory model that light travels in straight lines from sources. This model explains why we see objects (light reaches our eyes directly from sources or via reflection), why shadows have the same shape as the object casting them, and how optical instruments work.

**Teaching guidance:** Demonstrate that light travels in straight lines by shining a torch through a series of cards with holes — the light only reaches the end if all holes are aligned. Use laser pointers (teacher-operated, safely) in a dusty or misty room to show the straight beam. Apply the straight-line model to explain how shadows have the same shape as the opaque object — draw ray diagrams showing light blocked by the object. Explain how we see objects: light from a source reflects off an object and travels in a straight line to our eyes. Use ray diagrams to model this process. Revisit shadow formation from Y3 and explain it using this model.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think light travels from the eye to the object (emission theory) rather than from the object to the eye. This misconception has deep historical roots and is very persistent. Some pupils believe light can bend around corners — it cannot without a reflective or refractive surface. Children may think shadows are dark because they contain something (a dark substance) rather than understanding that a shadow is simply an area where light does not reach.

**Key vocabulary:** light, straight line, ray, beam, source, reflect, eye, shadow, opaque, ray diagram, travel, block, illuminate, direction, model, refract

## Domain: SC-KS2-D006 — Forces and Magnets
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Forces and Magnets at KS2 introduces pupils to the concept of force as an interaction between objects, progressing from the intuitive, qualitative understanding of push and pull in KS1 to a more systematic, measurable account. Pupils investigate how objects move on different surfaces, understanding friction as a force that opposes motion, and explore the properties of magnets — attraction, repulsion and the existence of magnetic fields. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to distinguish between contact forces (friction, air resistance, water resistance) and non-contact forces (gravity, magnetic and electrostatic forces), comparing how objects move on different surfaces. This foundational understanding of forces prepares pupils for the more mathematical treatment of Newton's laws at KS3.

### Concepts (3)

#### SC-KS2-C025 — Contact and Non-Contact Forces
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that most forces require direct contact between objects (e.g., pushing, pulling, friction) but some forces, notably magnetic forces and gravity, can act at a distance without direct contact.

**Teaching guidance:** Explore contact forces through practical activities: pushing and pulling objects, observing friction between surfaces, and feeling the resistance of water when moving objects through it. Introduce non-contact forces using magnets (attraction and repulsion without touching) and dropping objects (gravity pulls without touching). Create a two-column sorting activity: 'forces that need touching' versus 'forces that act at a distance'. Use force arrows to represent the direction of forces on simple diagrams. Discuss everyday examples of both types.

**Common misconceptions:** Children commonly think a force is needed to keep an object moving, rather than understanding that forces are needed to start, stop or change movement (a precursor to Newton's first law). Some pupils believe gravity only acts on heavy objects or only works at large distances. Children may think that magnetic force requires contact because they usually see magnets touching metal objects — they need to explore magnetic attraction through materials and at a distance.

**Key vocabulary:** force, push, pull, contact, non-contact, friction, gravity, magnetic, attract, repel, distance, surface, direction, strength, interaction

#### SC-KS2-C026 — Magnetic Properties
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that magnets attract some materials (magnetic materials, principally metals containing iron, nickel or cobalt) and not others. Magnets have two poles (north and south); like poles repel and unlike poles attract. Magnetic force acts at a distance.

**Teaching guidance:** Provide a collection of magnets (bar, horseshoe, ring) and a variety of materials for systematic testing. Challenge pupils to predict and then test which materials are attracted to magnets, recording results in a table. Investigate magnetic poles: demonstrate that like poles repel and unlike poles attract using bar magnets on a smooth surface or suspended from string. Explore the magnetic field using iron filings on paper above a bar magnet. Test whether magnetic force acts through materials (paper, wood, plastic, water) by trying to move a paper clip through a table. Investigate which metals are magnetic — only iron, nickel and cobalt, not all metals.

**Common misconceptions:** The most widespread misconception is that all metals are magnetic. Only iron, nickel, cobalt and their alloys (e.g., steel) are magnetic — copper, aluminium, gold and silver are not. Children often think magnets are strongest in the middle rather than at the poles. Some pupils believe bigger magnets are always stronger than smaller ones, which is not necessarily true as strength depends on the material and magnetisation.

**Key vocabulary:** magnet, magnetic, attract, repel, pole, north, south, iron, nickel, cobalt, force, field, material, metal, non-magnetic, bar magnet, horseshoe magnet

#### SC-KS2-C027 — Friction and Movement on Surfaces
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that the surface of an object affects how it moves — rough surfaces produce more friction and slow objects down more than smooth surfaces. Friction is a contact force.

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate friction by rolling a toy car down a ramp onto different surfaces (carpet, sandpaper, smooth wood, lino) and measuring the distance it travels. Use force meters to pull objects across different surfaces and compare the readings. Discuss why shoes have treads, why tyres have grip patterns, and why ice is slippery. Explore the idea that friction can be both useful (brakes, grip) and a nuisance (wear, heat, slowing down). Connect to the concept that rougher surfaces produce more friction than smoother ones.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think that smooth objects have no friction at all, rather than understanding that all surfaces produce some friction when in contact. Some pupils believe friction only slows things down and do not recognise its essential role in enabling movement — without friction, we could not walk, drive or hold objects. Children may think friction is only related to the roughness of surfaces, not understanding that weight and surface area also play a role.

**Key vocabulary:** friction, surface, rough, smooth, grip, slide, resistance, force, contact, ramp, distance, slow down, speed up, useful, nuisance, force meter

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS2-D006-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Sorting, classifying and identifying similarities directly trains pupils to recognise regularities and use them to predict or generalise.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Evidence and Argument**: What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Drawing conclusions from observations requires constructing a claim supported by specific evidence — not just describing what was seen.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'

**SC-KS2-D006-CL002:**
- **Cause and Effect** (primary): What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Fair testing and investigations are designed to isolate variables and establish causal relationships — the cognitive demand is reasoning from controlled evidence to causal claims.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Data from repeated investigations reveals patterns that allow pupils to generalise their findings beyond the specific test conditions.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

#### SC-KS2-CV001 — Friction Investigation (investigation)
Fair test investigation into how surface type affects friction. Pupils measure distance a toy car travels on different surfaces.
Delivers: SC-KS2-C002, SC-KS2-C003, SC-KS2-C005, SC-KS2-C025, SC-KS2-C027

## Domain: SC-KS2-D007 — Living Things and Their Habitats
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Living Things and Their Habitats at KS2 develops pupils' ecological understanding, moving from the simple identification of living and non-living things at KS1 to an understanding of the relationships between organisms and their environments. Pupils classify living things into broad groups (plants, animals, fungi, micro-organisms) using observable characteristics, and understand how classification systems are constructed and used by scientists. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to explore how habitats provide for the basic needs of different organisms, to construct and interpret food chains, and to understand how changes to an environment can affect the living things that depend on it. Pupils are introduced to the concepts of producer, consumer, predator and prey.

### Concepts (7)

#### SC-KS2-C028 — Classification Keys
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Using and making simple branching keys (dichotomous keys) to identify and classify living things by asking yes/no questions about observable characteristics. An important tool in biological identification.

**Teaching guidance:** Begin with teacher-made branching keys that pupils use to identify specimens (leaves, minibeasts, shells). Progress to pupils creating their own keys by choosing yes/no questions based on observable characteristics. Start with familiar objects (e.g., sorting classroom items) before moving to living organisms. Emphasise that good key questions focus on observable, unambiguous features rather than subjective qualities. Use local habitats for fieldwork — identify organisms found in the school grounds using published keys, then create a key for the organisms found.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often write key questions based on subjective criteria ('Is it pretty?') rather than observable, measurable features ('Does it have more than six legs?'). Some children think a key must lead to only one correct answer at each branch, not understanding that keys are tools for narrowing down possibilities based on available evidence. Children may confuse classification keys with identification guides that use pictures rather than questions.

**Key vocabulary:** classification key, branching key, dichotomous, identify, characteristic, feature, observable, yes/no, question, group, sort, organism, specimen, distinguish

#### SC-KS2-C029 — Variety of Classification Criteria
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding that living things can be grouped in many different ways depending on the characteristics chosen as criteria. No single correct grouping — different criteria produce different and equally valid classifications.

**Teaching guidance:** Provide the same set of organisms (or pictures) and challenge groups to classify them using different criteria: habitat, diet, body covering, number of legs, method of reproduction. Compare the different groupings that result and discuss which are most useful for different purposes. Introduce the idea that scientists choose classification criteria carefully and that the system we use today is based on evolutionary relationships. Use Venn diagrams and Carroll diagrams to explore overlapping and non-overlapping criteria. Discuss why some organisms are difficult to classify.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think there is only one correct way to classify organisms, not recognising that different criteria produce different but equally valid groupings. Some pupils classify animals by where they live rather than by biological features — for example, grouping whales with fish because they live in water. Children may struggle with organisms that do not fit neatly into one group, such as platypuses (mammals that lay eggs).

**Key vocabulary:** classify, group, criteria, characteristic, feature, similar, different, sort, compare, habitat, structure, Venn diagram, Carroll diagram, category, organism

#### SC-KS2-C030 — Environmental Change and Impact
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding that environments change over time (seasonal changes, human impact) and that these changes can sometimes pose dangers to living things. Includes positive and negative human impacts on environments.

**Teaching guidance:** Study a local habitat over time and record seasonal changes in the organisms present. Discuss both positive human impacts (nature reserves, reforestation, wildlife corridors) and negative impacts (pollution, deforestation, littering, urbanisation). Use case studies of environmental change — for example, the effect of hedgerow removal on bird populations, or the impact of river pollution on aquatic invertebrates. Investigate how changes in one part of a food chain affect other organisms. Link to geography work on land use and sustainability.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think environmental change is always negative and caused by humans, not recognising that natural changes (seasons, flooding, volcanic eruptions) also affect habitats. Some pupils believe that if an animal's habitat is destroyed, it can simply move to another habitat without difficulty. Children may not understand that changes to one species in a food chain have knock-on effects for other species in the same ecosystem.

**Key vocabulary:** environment, habitat, change, impact, pollution, deforestation, conservation, endangered, extinct, human, positive, negative, food chain, population, adapt, seasonal

#### SC-KS2-C044 — Comparative Life Cycles
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5 | Fan-out: 2

Describing and comparing the life cycles of four types of animals: mammals (live birth, parental care), amphibians (metamorphosis, aquatic larval stage), insects (complete or incomplete metamorphosis), birds (eggs, hatching, fledging). Understanding variety within the concept of life cycle.

**Teaching guidance:** Compare life cycles of mammals (e.g., human — live birth, extended parental care), amphibians (e.g., frog — eggs → tadpole → froglet → adult frog, metamorphosis), insects (e.g., butterfly — egg → caterpillar → chrysalis → butterfly, complete metamorphosis), and birds (e.g., robin — eggs → chick → fledgling → adult, hatching). Use diagrams to show each life cycle as a circular process. Create comparison tables highlighting similarities and differences. If possible, observe real life cycles — frog spawn developing, caterpillars pupating, chick eggs hatching. Discuss why different animals have evolved such different strategies.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think metamorphosis only applies to butterflies, not recognising it in frogs, beetles, and many other animals. Some pupils believe all animals are born as miniature versions of the adult (like mammals), not understanding that many go through dramatically different larval stages. Children may think a chrysalis is a resting state where nothing happens, rather than understanding that major body restructuring occurs inside.

**Key vocabulary:** life cycle, mammal, amphibian, insect, bird, metamorphosis, larva, pupa, tadpole, chrysalis, caterpillar, egg, hatch, fledgling, adult, offspring, gestation, stage

#### SC-KS2-C045 — Reproduction in Plants and Animals
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding the life process of reproduction. In plants: sexual reproduction (pollination, fertilisation, seed formation) and asexual reproduction (runners, bulbs, cuttings, tubers). In animals: sexual reproduction. Understanding that reproduction maintains species.

**Teaching guidance:** Distinguish between sexual reproduction (two parents, offspring show variation) and asexual reproduction (one parent, offspring genetically identical to parent). For plants: review pollination and seed formation as sexual reproduction, then investigate asexual methods — take cuttings from geraniums, plant strawberry runners, grow new plants from potato tubers and garlic bulbs. For animals: discuss sexual reproduction without detailed mechanism (appropriate to Y5). Compare sexual and asexual reproduction in terms of the variety of offspring produced. Link to evolution — sexual reproduction produces variation, which is the raw material for natural selection.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think all reproduction requires two parents, not understanding that many organisms (plants, some animals) can reproduce asexually. Some pupils confuse growth with reproduction — a plant getting bigger is growth, not reproduction. Children may believe that cuttings from a plant will produce a different variety of plant rather than an identical clone of the parent.

**Key vocabulary:** reproduction, sexual, asexual, offspring, parent, variation, identical, pollination, fertilisation, seed, cutting, runner, tuber, bulb, clone, species, inherit

#### SC-KS2-C058 — Formal Biological Classification
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding the formal biological classification system: broad groups of living things (micro-organisms, plants, animals) can be subdivided. Animals classified as vertebrates (fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals) and invertebrates. Plants classified as flowering and non-flowering. Based on work of Carl Linnaeus.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce Linnaeus and his contribution to biological classification. Use a classification hierarchy diagram showing the broad groups: living things → plants and animals → further subdivisions. For animals, distinguish vertebrates (fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals) from invertebrates (insects, spiders, worms, snails, etc.). For plants, distinguish flowering from non-flowering plants (ferns, mosses, conifers). Introduce micro-organisms as a third major group alongside plants and animals. Use specimen collections or high-quality photographs to practise classification. Create classification posters showing the hierarchy with examples at each level.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think invertebrates are less important or less complex than vertebrates — invertebrates actually make up about 97% of all animal species. Some pupils classify organisms by habitat rather than biological features (putting dolphins with fish because they live in water). Children may not recognise that fungi are a separate group, not plants — fungi do not photosynthesise. Some pupils think classification is about personal preference rather than observable shared characteristics.

**Key vocabulary:** classification, Linnaeus, vertebrate, invertebrate, fish, amphibian, reptile, bird, mammal, insect, flowering plant, non-flowering plant, micro-organism, kingdom, group, characteristic, hierarchy

#### SC-KS2-C059 — Micro-organisms
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Introduction to micro-organisms as a broad group of living things too small to see with the naked eye. Included in the formal classification of living things. Not yet expected to classify into bacteria, fungi, viruses etc. at this stage.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce micro-organisms through practical examples: grow bread mould, observe yeast producing bubbles when mixed with warm water and sugar, discuss bacteria in yoghurt-making. Use microscope images or videos to show the diversity of micro-organisms. Discuss both helpful micro-organisms (yeast for bread, bacteria for decomposition, gut bacteria for digestion) and harmful ones (bacteria causing food poisoning, viruses causing illness). Link to hygiene — handwashing, food safety. Emphasise that micro-organisms are living things that are too small to see without a microscope. At this stage, pupils need not classify them into bacteria, viruses and fungi.

**Common misconceptions:** Children commonly believe that all micro-organisms are harmful 'germs', when many are essential for life — decomposition, digestion, food production. Some pupils think micro-organisms are not really alive because they cannot be seen. Children may confuse bacteria and viruses, thinking they are the same thing and can be treated the same way (antibiotics work against bacteria but not viruses). Some pupils think micro-organisms only exist in 'dirty' places.

**Key vocabulary:** micro-organism, microbe, bacteria, virus, fungi, yeast, mould, microscope, tiny, invisible, decompose, disease, hygiene, helpful, harmful, living

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS2-D007-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Sorting, classifying and identifying similarities directly trains pupils to recognise regularities and use them to predict or generalise.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Evidence and Argument**: What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Drawing conclusions from observations requires constructing a claim supported by specific evidence — not just describing what was seen.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'

**SC-KS2-D007-CL002:**
- **Cause and Effect** (primary): What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Fair testing and investigations are designed to isolate variables and establish causal relationships — the cognitive demand is reasoning from controlled evidence to causal claims.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Data from repeated investigations reveals patterns that allow pupils to generalise their findings beyond the specific test conditions.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**SC-KS2-D007-CL003:**

Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**SC-KS2-D007-CL004:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Food chains, food webs and ecosystems are system models: pupils map components (producers, consumers, decomposers), trace energy flows, and predict what happens when one part changes.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Stability and Change**: What keeps this stable, what causes change, and how quickly does change happen?
  Why: Ecosystems maintain dynamic equilibria that can be disrupted by changes to one component — exploring what keeps the system stable and what destabilises it is an equally powerful framing.
  AI instruction: Use the STABILITY AND CHANGE lens: prompt pupils to identify what conditions keep a system in balance, what disrupts equilibrium, and how change can be gradual or sudden. Useful questions: 'What keeps this the same?', 'What would tip it into change?', 'Is the change reversible?', 'How fast is this changing, and why?'

## Domain: SC-KS2-D011 — Properties and Changes of Materials
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Properties and Changes of Materials at upper KS2 requires pupils to compare and group materials based on physical properties — hardness, solubility, thermal conductivity, response to magnets, transparency — and to investigate mixtures and methods of separating them. Pupils understand that some changes (dissolving, mixing, changes of state) are reversible while others (burning, rusting, reactions involving new substances) are not, and learn to describe the differences using appropriate scientific language. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to investigate whether dissolving, mixing and changes of state produce new materials, providing the foundation for understanding chemical change at KS3.

### Concepts (5)

#### SC-KS2-C047 — Extended Material Properties
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5 | Fan-out: 1

Comparing and grouping materials based on a wider range of properties: hardness, solubility, transparency, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and response to magnets. Builds on KS1 and Y4 materials knowledge with additional property types.

**Teaching guidance:** Set up a systematic investigation of material properties using a range of tests: scratch test for hardness (compare wood, metal, plastic, stone), dissolving test for solubility (test sugar, sand, salt, chalk in water), transparency test (classify as transparent, translucent or opaque), thermal conductivity test (wrap identical cups of hot water in different materials and measure cooling rate), electrical conductivity test (insert into a circuit gap), and magnet test. Record results in a property comparison table. Discuss how property knowledge helps engineers and designers choose the right material for each purpose.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often confuse thermal conductivity with temperature — a metal spoon feels cold not because it is colder than a wooden spoon but because it conducts heat away from your hand faster. Some pupils think that if a material dissolves it has disappeared or been destroyed, rather than understanding it has dispersed into the liquid. Children may believe that hardness and strength are the same thing — glass is hard but brittle, while rubber is soft but strong.

**Key vocabulary:** property, hardness, solubility, transparency, conductivity, thermal, electrical, magnetic, opaque, translucent, transparent, dissolve, soluble, insoluble, compare, group, material, purpose

#### SC-KS2-C048 — Dissolving and Solutions
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding that some materials dissolve in liquid to form a solution — the solute appears to disappear but is not lost. Understanding that a dissolved substance can be recovered by evaporating the solvent. Dissolving is different from melting.

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate dissolving by adding salt, sugar, sand and chalk to water, stirring and observing. Weigh the water before and after dissolving salt to show the mass has increased — the salt is still there even though invisible. Investigate factors that affect dissolving rate: temperature, stirring, grain size. Recover a dissolved substance by evaporating the water — leave a saucer of salt solution on a warm windowsill and observe salt crystals forming. Explicitly distinguish dissolving from melting: dissolving requires a solvent (liquid), melting requires heat. Use the terms solute, solvent and solution consistently.

**Common misconceptions:** The most common misconception is confusing dissolving with melting. Dissolving requires a liquid (solvent); melting requires heat to change a solid to a liquid. Sugar dissolves in water; ice melts in warm air. Children often think that when something dissolves it has gone forever or been destroyed — weighing before and after proves the dissolved substance is still present. Some pupils think stirring makes more solid dissolve rather than simply speeding up the process.

**Key vocabulary:** dissolve, solution, solute, solvent, soluble, insoluble, filter, evaporate, recover, crystal, stir, temperature, rate, mass, disappear, transparent, mixture

#### SC-KS2-C049 — Separating Mixtures
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding that mixtures of solids, liquids and gases can be separated using various techniques: filtering (remove insoluble solids from liquids), sieving (separate solids by particle size), evaporating (recover dissolved solids). Technique chosen depends on properties of components.

**Teaching guidance:** Demonstrate each separation technique practically: use sieving to separate rice from flour; filtering to separate sand from water (using filter paper and funnel); evaporating to recover salt from salt water (using an evaporating dish over a water bath). Discuss which technique is appropriate for which mixture and why — sieving separates by particle size, filtering separates insoluble solids from liquids, evaporation separates dissolved solids from liquids. Challenge pupils with mystery mixtures to separate (e.g., salt, sand and iron filings — use magnet, then dissolve salt in water and filter, then evaporate). Link separation techniques to real-world applications: water purification, mining, recycling.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think that filtering can separate dissolved substances from water — it cannot; only evaporation or distillation works for solutions. Some pupils confuse sieving with filtering, not recognising the difference in particle size involved. Children may believe that once mixed, substances can never be separated, rather than understanding that different properties allow different separation methods.

**Key vocabulary:** separate, mixture, filter, sieve, evaporate, dissolve, insoluble, soluble, technique, method, filter paper, funnel, residue, filtrate, solution, particle, purify

#### SC-KS2-C050 — Reversible Changes
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that some material changes are reversible — the original materials can be recovered. Examples: dissolving, mixing, melting, freezing, evaporation, condensation. The material is changed in form but not in substance.

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate a range of reversible changes: melt chocolate and let it re-solidify; dissolve salt and evaporate to recover it; freeze water and melt the ice. Create a concept map linking all reversible changes, emphasising that the original materials can always be recovered and no new substance is formed. Compare each reversible change with an equivalent irreversible change — melting chocolate (reversible) versus burning toast (irreversible). Use the criterion 'Can we get the original material back?' as the key test. Discuss everyday examples: drying wet clothes (reversible evaporation of water), recycling metals by melting and reshaping.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think that all changes caused by heating are irreversible, not recognising that melting and evaporation are reversible. Some pupils believe dissolving is irreversible because they cannot see the solid, when in fact evaporation will recover it. Children may confuse reversible changes with the idea of 'undoing' something — reversibility means the original materials can be recovered, not that the exact same object is restored.

**Key vocabulary:** reversible, change, recover, original, material, melt, freeze, dissolve, evaporate, condense, mix, separate, substance, form, physical change, state

#### SC-KS2-C051 — Irreversible Changes
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding that some changes result in the formation of new materials and are not easily reversed. Examples: burning, rusting, acid reacting with bicarbonate of soda, cooking. New substances are formed that cannot easily be changed back.

**Teaching guidance:** Demonstrate irreversible changes safely: burn a piece of paper or candle (adult-supervised), mix vinegar with bicarbonate of soda to observe gas production, cook an egg, and observe rusting of iron wool in damp conditions over several days. In each case, discuss what evidence shows a new substance has formed — change in colour, production of gas, change in temperature, production of light or smoke. Contrast with reversible changes done in parallel: melt ice alongside burning a candle. Emphasise that irreversible changes produce new materials with different properties. Introduce the term 'chemical change' informally.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often struggle to distinguish irreversible from reversible changes. A useful test is: 'Has a new substance been formed with different properties?' Cooking an egg is irreversible — you cannot uncook it because the proteins have permanently changed. Some pupils think burning makes things disappear rather than producing new substances (ash, gases, smoke). Children may not recognise rusting as a chemical change because it happens slowly.

**Key vocabulary:** irreversible, chemical change, new substance, burn, rust, react, gas, temperature change, permanent, original, material, evidence, property, formation, combustion

**SC-KS2-D011-CL001:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Material properties link physical structure (molecular arrangement, surface texture) to functional behaviour (waterproofing, strength, flexibility) — the key question is always 'why does this material behave this way?'

Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Properties can be sorted and classified into patterns (metals conduct, insulators don't), allowing pupils to make predictions about unfamiliar materials.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**SC-KS2-D011-CL002:**

## Domain: SC-KS2-D012 — Earth and Space
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Earth and Space at upper KS2 provides pupils with an understanding of the solar system, Earth's movements and the phenomena associated with them — day and night, seasons, phases of the Moon. Pupils learn that the Earth, along with other planets, orbits the Sun, and that the Moon orbits the Earth, using models and research to understand the relative sizes, distances and movements of these bodies. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to explain day and night as the result of Earth rotating on its axis, and to understand how this differs from the annual orbit of the Earth around the Sun. This provides important foundations for astronomical and geographical concepts at KS3 and beyond.

### Concepts (3)

#### SC-KS2-C052 — The Solar System
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that the Sun is a star at the centre of our solar system and that eight planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) orbit it. Heliocentric model replaced earlier geocentric model. History of scientific ideas including Ptolemy, Alhazen, Copernicus.

**Teaching guidance:** Create a scale model of the solar system using appropriately scaled spheres (or fruits) to show relative sizes, and use the school field or corridor to show relative distances (even scaled down, the distances are striking). Teach the order of the eight planets using a mnemonic (e.g., 'My Very Enthusiastic Mother Just Served Us Nachos'). Discuss the heliocentric model and its history — how Copernicus, Galileo and others challenged the geocentric model with evidence from observations. Use videos or planetarium software to visualise planetary orbits. Emphasise that the Sun is a star and that planets orbit it due to gravity.

**Common misconceptions:** Children commonly believe that the Sun orbits the Earth (geocentric model) because that matches everyday observation of the Sun 'moving' across the sky. Pupils often dramatically underestimate the distances between planets and overestimate the relative size of Earth compared to Jupiter or Saturn. Some children think stars and planets are the same thing — stars produce light, planets reflect it. Children may believe Pluto is still classified as a planet.

**Key vocabulary:** solar system, Sun, star, planet, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, orbit, heliocentric, geocentric, satellite, gravity, astronomer, Copernicus

#### SC-KS2-C053 — Earth's Rotation and Day/Night
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding that the Earth rotates on its axis once every 24 hours, causing day and night. The part of Earth facing the Sun experiences day; the opposite side experiences night. The Sun's apparent movement across the sky is explained by Earth's rotation, not the Sun moving.

**Teaching guidance:** Use a globe and a torch in a darkened room to model Earth's rotation and day/night. Mark the pupils' location on the globe and slowly rotate it to show how their location moves from day (facing the torch) to night (facing away). Emphasise that it is Earth rotating, not the Sun moving around Earth. Discuss time zones as evidence of Earth's rotation. Use the model to explain why the Sun appears to move across the sky during the day — we are rotating beneath a stationary Sun. Link to KS1 work on seasonal day length changes. Use slow-motion videos of sunrises and sunsets to reinforce that these are caused by Earth's rotation.

**Common misconceptions:** The most persistent misconception is that day and night are caused by the Sun going around the Earth. Some children think night occurs because the Moon or clouds block the Sun. Pupils may confuse Earth's daily rotation (causing day/night) with its yearly orbit around the Sun (causing seasons). Some children think that different countries have day and night at different times because the Sun travels to different places, rather than because Earth rotates.

**Key vocabulary:** Earth, rotate, rotation, axis, spin, day, night, Sun, globe, orbit, shadow, time zone, sunrise, sunset, 24 hours, apparent movement

#### SC-KS2-C054 — Moon's Orbit
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding that the Moon is a natural satellite that orbits the Earth. The Moon is approximately spherical. Other planets also have moons. The Moon's orbital relationship with Earth distinguishes it from planets.

**Teaching guidance:** Use a model with a torch (Sun), a large ball (Earth) and a small ball (Moon) to demonstrate the Moon orbiting Earth while Earth orbits the Sun. Observe the Moon over a month and record its appearance — noting the phases from new moon through crescent, quarter, gibbous to full moon and back. Discuss why the Moon appears to change shape (different portions illuminated as it orbits). Compare the Moon with planets — the Moon is a natural satellite, not a planet. Research other moons in the solar system (Jupiter's Galilean moons, Saturn's Titan). Emphasise that the Moon is approximately spherical.

**Common misconceptions:** Children commonly believe the Moon produces its own light — it reflects sunlight. Some pupils think the Moon's phases are caused by Earth's shadow falling on the Moon (that is a lunar eclipse, which is rare). Children may believe the Moon is only visible at night, when in fact it is often visible during the day. Some pupils think the Moon does not rotate, but it does — once per orbit, which is why we always see the same face.

**Key vocabulary:** Moon, orbit, satellite, natural satellite, Earth, phase, full moon, new moon, crescent, sphere, spherical, reflect, illuminate, rotate, month, lunar

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS2-D012-CL001:**
- **Cause and Effect** (primary): What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Fair testing and investigations are designed to isolate variables and establish causal relationships — the cognitive demand is reasoning from controlled evidence to causal claims.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Data from repeated investigations reveals patterns that allow pupils to generalise their findings beyond the specific test conditions.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

## Domain: SC-KS2-D014 — Evolution and Inheritance
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Evolution and Inheritance at upper KS2 introduces pupils to Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection as the scientific explanation for the diversity of life on Earth. Pupils learn that living things have changed over millions of years and that fossils provide evidence of organisms that lived long ago, connecting this to the geological evidence studied in the Rocks domain. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to understand that offspring are not identical to their parents (variation), that some variations are advantageous in a particular environment (natural selection), and that this can lead to evolution over many generations. This domain provides the conceptual framework for understanding inheritance, genetics and biodiversity at KS3.

### Concepts (4)

#### SC-KS2-C063 — Fossils as Evidence of Change Over Time
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that fossils (introduced in Y3 as trapped remains in rock) provide evidence that living things have changed over time and that animals and plants that no longer exist once lived on Earth millions of years ago.

**Teaching guidance:** Revisit fossil knowledge from Year 3 and extend it to the concept of change over time. Compare fossils of extinct organisms with their closest living relatives — for example, ammonites with modern nautilus, trilobites with modern woodlice. Use a geological timeline to show when major groups appeared and disappeared. Discuss what fossils tell us: the types of organisms that existed, the environments they lived in, and how life has changed over millions of years. Link to Darwin's use of fossil evidence in developing his theory of evolution. Examine the concept of extinction — why species disappear and what causes it.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think dinosaurs and humans lived at the same time. Dinosaurs became extinct approximately 66 million years ago; modern humans appeared around 300,000 years ago. Some pupils believe that fossils are only of dinosaurs, not recognising the vast range of fossilised organisms (plants, shells, fish, insects). Children may think that if a species goes extinct, it was somehow 'inferior', rather than understanding that extinction results from environmental change exceeding a species' ability to adapt.

**Key vocabulary:** fossil, evidence, extinct, change, time, millions of years, species, organism, geological, ancient, remains, compare, ancestor, descendant, evolution, palaeontology

#### SC-KS2-C064 — Variation in Offspring
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that living things reproduce offspring of the same kind, but that offspring vary and are not identical to their parents or to each other. This natural variation within species is the raw material for natural selection. Genes/chromosomes not required at this stage.

**Teaching guidance:** Explore variation within the class — measure hand span, height, arm length, eye colour, and discuss why no two people are identical (except identical twins, who share DNA). Compare parents and offspring using photographs: children resemble their parents but are not identical to them. Investigate variation in other organisms — leaf size in a species of tree, shell patterns in snails. Distinguish between inherited variation (eye colour, nose shape) and environmental variation (scars, hairstyle, language). At this stage, genes and chromosomes are not required, but the idea that characteristics are passed from parent to offspring through reproduction should be established.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think offspring are exact copies of their parents or an exact 50/50 mix. Offspring inherit a combination of characteristics but the expression is complex and not a simple blend. Some pupils confuse inherited characteristics with learned or environmental characteristics — speaking English is environmental, not inherited. Children may believe that individual organisms can change their characteristics during their lifetime and pass these changes to offspring (Lamarckian inheritance), which is incorrect.

**Key vocabulary:** variation, offspring, parent, inherit, characteristic, feature, similar, different, species, reproduce, identical, unique, trait, generation, diversity

#### SC-KS2-C065 — Adaptation
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that animals and plants have features that help them survive in their particular environment. These adaptations may be structural (camouflage, body shape, insulation) or behavioural. Different environments select for different adaptations.

**Teaching guidance:** Use striking examples of adaptation to engage pupils: polar bear fur (insulation and camouflage), cactus spines (reduced water loss), giraffe neck (reaching high vegetation), woodpecker beak (drilling into wood). Compare organisms from different environments — arctic versus desert, deep sea versus rainforest — and identify how their features help them survive. Challenge pupils to design an imaginary animal adapted to a specific environment, justifying each feature. Investigate examples of camouflage using peppered moth photographs. Distinguish between structural adaptations (physical features) and behavioural adaptations (migration, hibernation, nocturnal activity).

**Common misconceptions:** Children commonly think that individual animals deliberately adapt or choose to develop helpful features in response to their environment (e.g., 'giraffes stretched their necks to reach high leaves'). Adaptation occurs over many generations through natural selection, not within an individual's lifetime. Some pupils think adaptation means animals are perfectly suited to their environment — in reality, organisms are 'good enough' rather than optimal. Children may believe that adaptation is a conscious or intentional process.

**Key vocabulary:** adaptation, adapted, environment, habitat, survive, feature, structural, behavioural, camouflage, predator, prey, competition, advantage, suited, desert, arctic, specialised

#### SC-KS2-C066 — Evolution
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding that adaptation may lead to evolution — that over very long periods of time, variation and natural selection can lead to populations becoming better adapted to their environments and to the development of new species. Work of Darwin and Wallace.

**Teaching guidance:** Build from the concepts of variation, inheritance and adaptation to explain evolution by natural selection: organisms vary; those with advantageous variations are more likely to survive and reproduce; their offspring inherit these variations; over many generations, the population changes. Use the peppered moth example (light moths on soot-covered trees during the Industrial Revolution) as a well-documented case study. Discuss Darwin's and Wallace's contributions and the evidence they gathered. Use simulations (e.g., bird beak tools picking up different 'food' types) to model natural selection. Emphasise the timescale — evolution typically occurs over thousands or millions of years, not within a single lifetime.

**Common misconceptions:** The most common misconception is that individual organisms evolve during their lifetime — evolution occurs across populations over many generations. Children may think evolution has a goal or direction ('aiming' towards a perfect form), when it is an undirected process driven by environmental pressures. Some pupils confuse evolution with metamorphosis (a frog changing from tadpole) or with individual growth. Children may think that evolution means species 'improve' over time, rather than understanding that species become better adapted to their current environment.

**Key vocabulary:** evolution, natural selection, variation, adaptation, inherit, generation, species, survival, reproduce, population, change, Darwin, Wallace, evidence, theory, extinction, ancestor

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS2-D014-CL001:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Food chains, food webs and ecosystems are system models: pupils map components (producers, consumers, decomposers), trace energy flows, and predict what happens when one part changes.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Stability and Change**: What keeps this stable, what causes change, and how quickly does change happen?
  Why: Ecosystems maintain dynamic equilibria that can be disrupted by changes to one component — exploring what keeps the system stable and what destabilises it is an equally powerful framing.
  AI instruction: Use the STABILITY AND CHANGE lens: prompt pupils to identify what conditions keep a system in balance, what disrupts equilibrium, and how change can be gradual or sudden. Useful questions: 'What keeps this the same?', 'What would tip it into change?', 'Is the change reversible?', 'How fast is this changing, and why?'

**SC-KS2-D014-CL002:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Sorting, classifying and identifying similarities directly trains pupils to recognise regularities and use them to predict or generalise.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Evidence and Argument**: What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Drawing conclusions from observations requires constructing a claim supported by specific evidence — not just describing what was seen.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'

**SC-KS2-D014-CL003:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Food chains, food webs and ecosystems are system models: pupils map components (producers, consumers, decomposers), trace energy flows, and predict what happens when one part changes.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Stability and Change**: What keeps this stable, what causes change, and how quickly does change happen?
  Why: Ecosystems maintain dynamic equilibria that can be disrupted by changes to one component — exploring what keeps the system stable and what destabilises it is an equally powerful framing.

### Content Vehicles — Teaching Packs (1)
These are choosable teaching packs that deliver concepts in this domain. Teachers select the pack that fits their class.

#### SC-KS2-CV009 — Evolution and Adaptation (investigation)
Research enquiry exploring how living things have changed over time — fossils as evidence, variation, adaptation, and natural selection (age-appropriate introduction).
Delivers: SC-KS2-C063, SC-KS2-C064, SC-KS2-C065, SC-KS2-C066
Enquiry type: research
Equipment: fossil samples or images, bird beak models (tweezers, pegs, chopsticks), seeds of different sizes, images of adapted organisms
Expected outcome: Fossils show how organisms have changed over time. Offspring vary from parents. Organisms are adapted to their environments. Over time, natural selection means better-adapted organisms survive and reproduce.
Key vocabulary: fossil, evolution, adaptation, variation, natural selection, inherited, species, extinct
Assessment: Can pupils explain how fossils provide evidence for change over time? Can they describe how an organism is adapted to its environment? Can they explain the basic mechanism of natural selection (variation -> selection -> inheritance)?
Success criteria: Explain how fossils provide evidence that living things have changed; Describe how at least 2 organisms are adapted to their environments; Explain that offspring vary and this variation can be inherited; Describe how natural selection leads to evolution over time

**Example feedback (correct):** "You recognised that 1/2 is larger than 2/5, and used the common denominator method correctly. The visualiser confirms it — the bar for 1/2 is noticeably longer."
**Example feedback (incorrect):** "The reasoning does not quite hold: you said both fractions are the same because the numerator in 2/5 is double the numerator in 1/2. But the denominator changed too — the pieces got smaller. Converting to tenths: 1/2 = 5/10 and 2/5 = 4/10. Which is larger now?"
**Avoid phrases:** ["Wrong", "Amazing!", "Brilliant!", "That is so clever", "You are so smart"]

**Agent feedback instructions:** Analytical feedback. Treat the child as a reasoning agent — analyse their reasoning, not just their answer. 'Your answer was [correct/incorrect] because your reasoning was [precise description].' Counter misconceptions analytically with evidence or visual proof. Delight only for insight that is genuinely sophisticated. No external rewards or comparison.

### Interaction Types (16 total, 8 primary)

**Primary (recommended for this year group):**
- **Drag to Categorise** (manipulation, touch_or_mouse): Drag items into labelled category buckets. Used for classification tasks across subjects.
- **Fraction Visualiser (Bar / Pizza / Set Model)** (maths_tool, touch_or_mouse): Interactive visual model for fractions. Switch between bar model, pizza model, and set (counters) model. Child manipulates to explore equivalence and comparison.
- **Inference Task — Socratic Questioning** (higher_order, text_or_voice): Guided Socratic question chain where the AI asks a sequence of progressively more specific questions to scaffold inference from text or data. Used from Y4.
- **Multiple Choice — 4 Options** (selection, tap_or_click): Standard 4-option multiple choice. The default format for Y4 onwards. Distractors should represent genuine misconceptions.
- **Pattern Discovery — I Notice / I Wonder** (higher_order, tap_or_keyboard): Open-ended discovery mode where child clicks 'I notice...' or 'I wonder...' buttons to record observations before instruction. Used to activate prior knowledge in productive failure sequences.
- **Text Highlight and Select** (reading_tool, touch_or_mouse): Highlight a passage in a reading extract to identify evidence, inference clues, or key vocabulary. Used from Y4 for comprehension tasks.
- **Text Input — Short Phrase** (text_input, keyboard): Type 3–10 words. Short-answer format for Y3–Y5 factual and explanatory questions.
- **Text Input — Full Sentence** (text_input, keyboard): Type a complete sentence (10–25 words). Suitable from Y4 for explanation, inference, and analysis tasks.

**Secondary (available but not primary):**
- Bus Stop Division (Short Division Layout) (maths_tool, keyboard): Step-through formal short division algorithm using the bus stop visual layout. Child works digit by digit, guided through each step.
- Compare and Contrast Table (higher_order, keyboard): Structured table for comparing two or more concepts, events, or organisms. Child populates cells. Used from Y5 for analysis tasks.
- Drag to Reorder (manipulation, touch_or_mouse): Drag items in a list to arrange them in correct sequence (events, steps in a process, ascending/descending order).
- Image Annotation — Tap to Label (manipulation, tap_or_click): Tap regions on an image (diagram, map, organism) to label them from a provided list or freetext. Used from Y2 for science diagrams and geography maps.
- Matching Pairs (manipulation, touch_or_mouse): Draw connections between matching items in two columns (term/definition, cause/effect, word/image).
- Multiple Choice — 5 Options (with None/All) (selection, tap_or_click): 5-option multiple choice, can include 'None of the above' or 'All of the above'. Appropriate for Y5+ to increase cognitive demand.
- Text Annotation — Add Comment (reading_tool, keyboard): Add typed or voiced comments to highlighted text passages. Used for literary analysis and close reading from Y5.
- Voice Input (input, voice): Child speaks their answer; transcribed by AI. Essential for pre-readers and emerging readers. Always available as fallback regardless of year group.

### Pedagogy Techniques (4)

**Generation Effect** **[NEW this year]**
Asking the learner to produce or recall information before it is shown to them. Self-generated items are retained 20-30% better than passively read items. The act of generation — even unsuccessful generation — deepens subsequent encoding when the answer is revealed.
Evidence: Slamecka & Graf 1978, McNamara & Healy 1995. Effect persists even when generation fails (unsuccessful generation followed by feedback shows better retention than study alone).
Implementation: Before showing the worked example or revealing the formula: 'What do you remember about how [X] works? Say or write it before I show you.' Accept partial and incorrect responses — the generation attempt, not the answer, is the mechanism.

**Interleaved Practice**
Mixing different types of problems or concepts within a session rather than blocked practice (all of one type, then all of another). Interleaving requires the learner to identify the problem type before solving — this discrimination step is the source of its effect.
Evidence: Bjork 2011, Rohrer & Taylor 2007, Rohrer et al. 2015. Effect size d=0.42 over blocked practice. Transfer advantage approximately 30-40% on delayed tests.
Implementation: Mix the current concept with 2-3 previously mastered concepts in the retrieval practice phase of a session. Tell the child: 'You are practising different types of problems — that is what makes you better.' Surface features vary; underlying structure is the same.

**Spaced Practice**
Distributing practice over time rather than massing it in a single session. Creates desirable difficulty through time-based forgetting and subsequent retrieval. The gap between practice sessions is the mechanism — not re-studying, but retrieving after a delay.
Evidence: Ebbinghaus 1885, Cepeda et al. 2006 (meta-analysis, n=317 studies). Effect size d=0.46. Optimal spacing interval increases as retention target increases.
Implementation: Return to a previously taught concept after a gap of 1-21 days (gap increases as mastery grows). Do not re-teach — retrieve only. The system selects spacing interval based on days since last correct response.

**Varied Practice (Surface Variation)**
Changing the surface features of practice problems (different contexts, numbers, scenarios, word choices) while keeping the underlying structure the same. Forces the learner to identify the deep structure rather than applying a surface-level pattern match.
Evidence: Schmidt & Bjork 1992, Kornell & Bjork 2008. Primary mechanism for transfer to novel problems. Contrast with blocked practice which improves performance during training but not on transfer tests.
Implementation: Use the same underlying concept but with different surface contexts across practice problems within a session (e.g., fractions with pizzas, then with ribbons, then with time). Do not vary the underlying structure — vary what it is about.
