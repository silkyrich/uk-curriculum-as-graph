# Year 4 English Lesson Plan -- Miss Okonkwo
## Covering: Reading Comprehension (EN-Y4-D003), Spelling (EN-Y4-D004), Writing Composition (EN-Y4-D006)

**Total lessons: 38**
**Structure: 6 text-based units + 1 consolidation/assessment unit**
**Note: Spelling has a daily 15-minute discrete session; the spelling focus listed per lesson is the pattern being taught/practised that week, not a full standalone lesson. Grammar (EN-Y4-D005) is not included in the graph data but would be taught alongside composition in practice.**

---

## Unit 1: Myths and Legends (Weeks 1-4)
**Anchor texts:** Greek myths (Marcia Williams or Hugh Lupton retellings), West African Anansi stories, Norse myths
**Reading focus:** Literary knowledge, comprehension strategies introduction
**Writing focus:** Narrative writing -- retelling a myth in own words
**Spelling focus:** Prefixes and suffixes, doubling rules

---

### Lesson 1 -- Building Our Reading Community
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C016 (Wide reading for positive attitudes), EN-Y4-C017 (Reading for different purposes)
**Type:** New content
**Approach:** Book browse session. Children explore a curated selection of myths, legends, fairy stories, poetry collections, non-fiction, and contemporary fiction arranged around the classroom. Children record three books they want to read this term in their reading journal. Discuss: why do people read? Introduce the idea of reading for different purposes (pleasure, information, escape, understanding). Set up daily independent reading time expectations.
**Spelling focus:** Diagnostic assessment -- which Y3/4 statutory words are secure?
**Key vocabulary:** reading for pleasure, genre, purpose, recommend, wide reading, choice

### Lesson 2 -- What Is a Myth?
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C019 (Fairy stories, myths and legends), EN-Y4-C024 (Comprehension monitoring)
**Type:** New content
**Approach:** Shared reading of the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur. Before reading, activate prior knowledge: what do children already know about myths? During reading, model comprehension monitoring -- stopping where meaning breaks down, rereading, asking "does this make sense?" After reading, discuss: what makes this a myth? Begin a working wall chart of myth features (heroes, quests, monsters, gods, moral lessons, origin explanations).
**Spelling focus:** Prefixes in-, il-, im-, ir- (meaning 'not'). Link to myth vocabulary: impossible, incredible, immortal.
**Key vocabulary:** myth, hero, quest, moral, culture, tradition, comprehension, monitor, reread

### Lesson 3 -- Comparing Myths Across Cultures
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C019 (Fairy stories, myths and legends), EN-Y4-C020 (Themes and conventions), EN-Y4-C022 (Effective language)
**Type:** New content
**Approach:** Read an Anansi story from West Africa. Compare with the Theseus myth: What are the shared features? (hero, obstacle, cleverness/bravery, lesson) What is different? (trickster vs warrior, humour vs tragedy, animal vs human). Discuss the theme of each: "What is this story really about?" Teach the difference between topic (what happens) and theme (what the story is about). Annotate a passage together, highlighting effective language choices.
**Spelling focus:** Prefixes continued. Sort words into in-/il-/im-/ir- categories. Articulate the rule.
**Key vocabulary:** theme, compare, trickster, culture, convention, effective, language, annotate, feature, pattern

### Lesson 4 -- Reading Between the Lines
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C026 (Drawing inferences with evidence), EN-Y4-C022 (Effective language)
**Type:** New content
**Approach:** Shared reading of a Norse myth (e.g., Thor's journey to Jotunheim). Teach the inference equation: clues from the text + what we already know = inference. Pause at key moments: "What is Thor feeling here? How do we know?" Children find evidence in the text -- at least two pieces -- to support each inference. Focus on how the author's word choices reveal character feelings and motivations. Modelled annotation of a short passage.
**Spelling focus:** Suffix -ation (explore to exploration, inform to information). Note root word changes.
**Key vocabulary:** infer, evidence, clue, motive, feeling, suggest, deduce, justify, prove

### Lesson 5 -- Planning a Myth Retelling
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C042 (Planning from model texts), EN-Y4-C043 (Generating ideas), EN-Y4-C045 (Paragraphing)
**Type:** New content
**Approach:** Revisit the structure of the myths we have read. Identify the pattern: setting/context, hero introduced, problem/quest, obstacles, climax, resolution/moral. Use this as a planning framework (boxing-up grid). Children choose a myth to retell in their own words (or create an original myth inspired by the patterns). Plan using the grid: 5-6 paragraphs, each with a clear purpose. Teach that each paragraph covers one stage of the story.
**Spelling focus:** Suffix -ous (fame to famous, danger to dangerous). Note the root word changes.
**Key vocabulary:** plan, structure, boxing up, paragraph, retell, model text, sequence, stage

### Lesson 6 -- Oral Rehearsal and Drafting: Opening
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C044 (Oral rehearsal), EN-Y4-C046 (Narrative elements: setting, character, plot), EN-Y4-C045 (Paragraphing)
**Type:** Practice
**Approach:** Focus on the opening paragraph: setting and character introduction. Teach setting description using sensory details -- what can the character see, hear, feel? Model writing an opening paragraph in shared writing, rehearsing each sentence orally before writing. Children rehearse their own opening sentences with a talk partner, then draft their first two paragraphs. Emphasise that planning guides drafting but writing may develop beyond the plan.
**Spelling focus:** Suffix doubling rule (C033). Forgetting, beginning, preferred. Sort: doubles vs doesn't double.
**Key vocabulary:** setting, sensory detail, character, rehearse, draft, compose, atmosphere, describe

### Lesson 7 -- Drafting: Building Tension and Climax
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C046 (Narrative elements), EN-Y4-C044 (Oral rehearsal), EN-Y4-C022 (Effective language)
**Type:** Practice
**Approach:** Analyse how the myth authors built tension: short sentences, powerful verbs, "show don't tell." Shared writing of a climax paragraph, modelling how to use the language techniques we identified in our reading. Children continue drafting their myth retelling, focusing on the obstacle and climax sections. Mini-lesson on using dialogue to reveal character -- rehearse speech orally before writing.
**Spelling focus:** Suffix doubling continued. Referring, occurring, committed vs visiting, gardening, listening.
**Key vocabulary:** tension, climax, dialogue, show don't tell, powerful verb, pace, short sentence, action

### Lesson 8 -- Editing and Proof-reading
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C048 (Evaluating own and others' writing), EN-Y4-C049 (Editing for vocabulary), EN-Y4-C050 (Proof-reading)
**Type:** Practice
**Approach:** Teach the editing process: read aloud to yourself, then to a partner. Use success criteria specific to myth retelling (setting described with sensory detail, character revealed through action/dialogue, tension built at climax, clear resolution). Partners identify one strength and one specific improvement. Children edit using a coloured pen: replace weak verbs, add sensory detail, check paragraph breaks. Then proof-read: check spelling of statutory words, check punctuation at sentence boundaries, check apostrophes.
**Spelling focus:** Apply prefix and suffix rules in proof-reading own myth retelling. Circle any words with in-/il-/im-/ir- or -ation/-ous suffixes.
**Key vocabulary:** evaluate, edit, proof-read, improve, feedback, strength, target, revise, accuracy

### Lesson 9 -- Prediction and Discussion
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C027 (Prediction from stated and implied detail), EN-Y4-C031 (Discussion about books), EN-Y4-C025 (Questions to improve comprehension)
**Type:** New content
**Approach:** Begin reading a longer myth (e.g., the Odyssey in an age-appropriate retelling). Read the first section together. Pause: "What do we predict will happen next? What evidence from the text supports this prediction? What do we know about myths that helps us predict?" Teach that predictions should use both text evidence and genre knowledge. Children generate questions at three levels: literal, inferential, evaluative. Discuss in groups using "Tell Me" framework.
**Spelling focus:** Begin homophones (C034): there/their/they're, its/it's. Memory aids and cloze passages.
**Key vocabulary:** predict, evidence, stated, implied, literal, inferential, evaluative, question, discuss, genre

### Lesson 10 -- Publication and Performance
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C051 (Reading aloud own writing), EN-Y4-C021 (Poetry and play performance), EN-Y4-C065 (Silent reading)
**Type:** Consolidation
**Approach:** Children produce a final copy of their myth retelling (or the strongest section). Practise reading aloud with expression -- model how to vary pace and volume for different parts of the story (slow and quiet for atmosphere, fast and loud for action). Children perform their myth to a partner, then to a small group. Listeners give feedback on performance quality. End with 15 minutes of silent independent reading from the wider myth/legend collection.
**Spelling focus:** Homophones continued: your/you're, whose/who's. Practise in dictation sentences.
**Key vocabulary:** perform, expression, pace, volume, tone, audience, publish, independent reading

---

## Unit 2: Poetry and Performance (Weeks 5-7)
**Anchor texts:** Anthology selection -- narrative poetry (The Highwayman extracts, Jabberwocky), free verse (Michael Rosen, Grace Nichols), limericks, shape poems
**Reading focus:** Poetry forms, effective language, comprehension through performance
**Writing focus:** Writing own poems; evaluating and editing poetry
**Spelling focus:** Homophones, etymological spelling patterns

---

### Lesson 11 -- Exploring Poetic Forms
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C023 (Forms of poetry), EN-Y4-C022 (Effective language), EN-Y4-C024 (Comprehension monitoring)
**Type:** New content
**Approach:** Poetry carousel: children rotate around tables, each with a different form of poetry (narrative poem, limerick, haiku, free verse, ballad, concrete poem). At each table, they read the poem, discuss what they notice about its structure, and record observations. Regroup: build a class chart of poetry forms and their features. Close reading of one narrative poem -- model comprehension monitoring ("This word puzzled me, so I..."). Discuss how form shapes meaning: why does a limerick demand humour? Why does a haiku demand precision?
**Spelling focus:** Etymological patterns (C035): /k/ spelt ch from Greek -- chorus, chemistry, character, scheme.
**Key vocabulary:** form, narrative poem, ballad, limerick, haiku, free verse, concrete poem, stanza, rhythm

### Lesson 12 -- Language for Effect in Poetry
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C022 (Effective language), EN-Y4-C026 (Drawing inferences with evidence), EN-Y4-C018 (Dictionary use)
**Type:** New content
**Approach:** Close reading of a rich poem (e.g., Grace Nichols or Valerie Bloom). Annotate together: highlight figurative language, sound effects (alliteration, onomatopoeia, rhyme), unusual word choices. For unfamiliar words, model dictionary use -- read all definitions, select the one that fits the context, consider the poet's reason for choosing this word. Discuss: what mood does the language create? What inferences can we make about the poet's feelings? Children annotate a second poem independently.
**Spelling focus:** Etymological patterns continued: /sh/ spelt ch from French -- chef, machine, chalet, brochure.
**Key vocabulary:** figurative language, simile, metaphor, alliteration, onomatopoeia, mood, atmosphere, effect, dictionary, definition

### Lesson 13 -- Preparing Poetry Performances
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C021 (Poetry and play performance), EN-Y4-C024 (Comprehension monitoring), EN-Y4-C025 (Questions to improve comprehension)
**Type:** Practice
**Approach:** Children work in groups to prepare a performance of an assigned poem. Before performing, they must understand the poem deeply: What is it about? What is the mood? What are the difficult words? (Use dictionaries.) How should it be read aloud? Groups annotate their poem with performance directions: where to pause, where to emphasise, where to change volume or pace. Rehearse with attention to expression, not just accuracy. Teacher circulates, prompting: "Why did you choose to read that line quietly?"
**Spelling focus:** -gue/-que endings (league, antique, unique, tongue). French origin words.
**Key vocabulary:** perform, rehearse, expression, emphasis, pause, tone, annotate, direction, ensemble

### Lesson 14 -- Writing Our Own Poems
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C042 (Planning from model texts), EN-Y4-C043 (Generating ideas), EN-Y4-C044 (Oral rehearsal)
**Type:** Practice
**Approach:** Use the poems studied as models. Children choose a form to write in (free verse encouraged for focus on language rather than form constraints). Brainstorm ideas through sensory exploration: What can you see/hear/smell/feel/taste? Shared writing of a poem together, modelling how to choose words for effect, rehearse each line aloud, and revise. Children draft their own poem. Emphasise oral rehearsal: "Read your line aloud. Does it sound right? Does it create the mood you want?"
**Spelling focus:** ei/eigh/ey for /ay/ (vein, eight, obey, neighbour, weigh). sc for /s/ (science, scene, scissors).
**Key vocabulary:** draft, compose, sensory, word choice, revise, model, free verse, line, image, voice

### Lesson 15 -- Poetry Performance Festival
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C021 (Poetry and play performance), EN-Y4-C051 (Reading aloud own writing), EN-Y4-C048 (Evaluating own and others' writing)
**Type:** Consolidation / Assessment
**Approach:** Two-part lesson. First half: groups perform their rehearsed poems from Lesson 13 to the class. Audience gives specific feedback using a framework: "I noticed you... and it made me feel/think..." Second half: children perform their own poems written in Lesson 14. Self-evaluate: "What worked well in my poem? What would I change?" Peer feedback on both performance and writing quality. This lesson assesses C021, C022, C023, C044, C048, and C051 simultaneously.
**Spelling focus:** Dictation using etymological pattern words from the past two weeks.
**Key vocabulary:** perform, feedback, evaluate, self-assess, effective, audience, respond, celebrate

---

## Unit 3: Non-fiction -- Information Texts (Weeks 8-11)
**Anchor texts:** Non-fiction books on a cross-curricular topic (e.g., Ancient Egypt, Rainforests, Volcanoes), reference texts, websites
**Reading focus:** Retrieval, summarising, text structure, dictionary use
**Writing focus:** Non-fiction report writing with organisational devices
**Spelling focus:** Statutory word list, dictionary use for spelling

---

### Lesson 16 -- Reading for Information
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C017 (Reading for different purposes), EN-Y4-C030 (Retrieving and recording from non-fiction), EN-Y4-C018 (Dictionary use)
**Type:** New content
**Approach:** Introduce the non-fiction topic. Provide a range of information texts on the subject. Teach three reading strategies for non-fiction: skimming (get the gist), scanning (find specific information), close reading (understand in depth). Model using contents pages and indexes to locate information. Practise retrieving specific facts and recording them as notes -- not copying. Teach dictionary use for subject-specific vocabulary encountered during reading. Children research a specific question, recording notes in a grid.
**Spelling focus:** Dictionary use for spelling (C038). Teach the "best guess then verify" strategy. Practise with topic vocabulary.
**Key vocabulary:** retrieve, record, skim, scan, close reading, contents, index, note-taking, paraphrase, source

### Lesson 17 -- Summarising Across Paragraphs
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C028 (Summarising main ideas), EN-Y4-C024 (Comprehension monitoring), EN-Y4-C031 (Discussion about books)
**Type:** New content
**Approach:** Read a multi-paragraph non-fiction text together. Teach summarising strategy: write one sentence per paragraph capturing the main idea, then combine into an overall summary. Model distinguishing essential information from supporting detail. Children practise with a second text: summarise each paragraph in one sentence, then write a 3-sentence summary of the whole text. Discuss: "Did you include the main ideas? Did you leave out important details? Is your summary concise?" Set a word limit to force conciseness.
**Spelling focus:** Statutory word list (C036) -- words linked to the topic. E.g., for Ancient Egypt: ancient, century, certain, different, knowledge, material, natural, particular.
**Key vocabulary:** summarise, main idea, paragraph, essential, detail, concise, gist, synthesise, key events

### Lesson 18 -- How Structure and Presentation Help the Reader
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C029 (Language, structure and presentation contributing to meaning), EN-Y4-C030 (Retrieving from non-fiction)
**Type:** New content
**Approach:** Examine two non-fiction texts on the same topic but with different structures and presentational features. Compare: How do headings, subheadings, diagrams, captions, text boxes, bullet points, and tables help the reader? Which text is easier to navigate? Why? Children annotate one text, labelling every structural and presentational feature and explaining its purpose. Key teaching point: these features are functional, not decorative -- they help the reader find and understand information.
**Spelling focus:** Statutory word list continued -- focus on words children are misspelling in their writing this week.
**Key vocabulary:** structure, presentation, heading, subheading, diagram, caption, text box, bullet point, layout, navigate, purpose

### Lesson 19 -- Planning a Non-fiction Report
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C042 (Planning from model texts), EN-Y4-C043 (Generating ideas), EN-Y4-C047 (Organisational devices)
**Type:** Practice
**Approach:** Analyse the structure of a model non-fiction report: introduction, subheaded sections, conclusion. Create a planning grid: What subheadings will we use? What key information goes under each? What diagrams or illustrations would help? What organisational devices will we include? Children plan their own non-fiction report on an aspect of the topic, using research notes from Lessons 16-17. Teach that organisational devices should be planned, not added afterwards.
**Spelling focus:** Statutory word list in dictation (C039). Dictate 2-3 sentences including topic-specific statutory words.
**Key vocabulary:** heading, subheading, organise, section, report, introduction, conclusion, diagram, caption, layout

### Lesson 20 -- Drafting a Non-fiction Report
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C045 (Paragraphing), EN-Y4-C047 (Organisational devices), EN-Y4-C044 (Oral rehearsal)
**Type:** Practice
**Approach:** Shared writing of the first section of a non-fiction report, modelling: topic sentence for each paragraph, supporting details, technical vocabulary, formal tone. Rehearse each sentence orally before writing. Children draft their reports following their plans. Mini-lesson on linking paragraphs: "In addition to this...", "Another important feature is...", "However, unlike..." Circulate to support paragraphing: "Is this still about the same main idea, or do you need a new paragraph?"
**Spelling focus:** Possessive apostrophe with plural nouns (C037). Link to writing: "the pharaohs' tombs," "the workers' tools," "the children's toys."
**Key vocabulary:** paragraph, topic sentence, formal tone, technical vocabulary, link, cohesion, draft, section

### Lesson 21 -- Evaluating and Editing Non-fiction Writing
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C048 (Evaluating writing), EN-Y4-C049 (Editing for vocabulary), EN-Y4-C050 (Proof-reading), EN-Y4-C030 (Retrieving from non-fiction)
**Type:** Practice
**Approach:** Paired evaluation using success criteria: Does the report have a clear introduction? Are subheadings used effectively? Is information accurate and well-organised? Is vocabulary precise and formal? Partners identify one strength and one specific improvement. Children edit with a coloured pen: strengthen vocabulary, improve paragraph links, add missing organisational devices. Then proof-read: check spelling of statutory words and topic vocabulary using dictionaries, check punctuation, check possessive apostrophes.
**Spelling focus:** Proof-reading focus. Children specifically check for correct homophones and statutory word spellings.
**Key vocabulary:** evaluate, edit, proof-read, success criteria, formal, precise, accurate, improve, revise

### Lesson 22 -- Cross-referencing and Critical Reading
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C030 (Retrieving from non-fiction), EN-Y4-C025 (Questions to improve comprehension), EN-Y4-C064 (Justifying views)
**Type:** Practice
**Approach:** Provide two sources that present slightly different information about the same aspect of the topic. Children compare: Where do the sources agree? Where do they differ? Which is more reliable? Why? Teach that not all written information is equally trustworthy. Children generate evaluative questions: "Why might this author have included this detail but not that one?" Justify their views about which source they find more useful, with specific evidence. Connect to their own report writing: "Where did you get your information? How do you know it's reliable?"
**Spelling focus:** Statutory word list -- personal spelling logs. Children identify their own tricky words.
**Key vocabulary:** cross-reference, compare, source, reliable, evidence, justify, critical, bias, accurate, trustworthy

---

## Unit 4: Contemporary Fiction (Weeks 12-16)
**Anchor text:** A whole-class novel (e.g., The Iron Man by Ted Hughes, Varjak Paw by SF Said, or The Boy at the Back of the Class by Onjali Rauf)
**Reading focus:** Inference, prediction, themes, justifying interpretations
**Writing focus:** Narrative writing -- character, setting, plot development
**Spelling focus:** Homophones, possessive apostrophe

---

### Lesson 23 -- First Impressions and Predictions
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C027 (Prediction), EN-Y4-C020 (Themes and conventions), EN-Y4-C065 (Silent reading)
**Type:** New content
**Approach:** Introduce the class novel. Examine the cover, blurb, and first page. Make initial predictions: "What genre is this? What conventions do we expect? What might happen?" Read the first chapter aloud. Children make three predictions based on details stated and implied. Record predictions in reading journals with supporting evidence. Discuss as a class: which predictions are most likely and why? End with 15 minutes of silent reading of own choice books.
**Spelling focus:** Homophones in context (C034): accept/except, affect/effect, weather/whether. Cloze activity.
**Key vocabulary:** predict, implied, stated, evidence, genre, convention, blurb, first impression, journal

### Lesson 24 -- Inference: Understanding Characters
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C026 (Drawing inferences with evidence), EN-Y4-C022 (Effective language), EN-Y4-C024 (Comprehension monitoring)
**Type:** Practice
**Approach:** Read the next section of the class novel. Focus on the main character. Teach: "The author doesn't tell us everything directly. We must infer from what characters say, do, and how others react to them." Children complete an inference grid: what the character says, what the character does, what others say about them, what we infer from this evidence. Close reading of a key passage: annotate language choices that reveal character. Monitor comprehension throughout: "What confused you? What fix-up strategy did you use?"
**Spelling focus:** Possessive apostrophe with plural nouns (C037). "The teachers' staffroom," "the children's playground." Practice sorting singular vs plural possessive.
**Key vocabulary:** infer, evidence, character, reveal, action, dialogue, reaction, motive, annotate, comprehension

### Lesson 25 -- Planning a Narrative: Character and Setting
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C042 (Planning from model texts), EN-Y4-C046 (Narrative elements), EN-Y4-C043 (Generating ideas)
**Type:** Practice
**Approach:** Analyse how the novel's author introduces character and setting. What techniques do they use? (Action, dialogue, sensory description, reactions of others.) Children plan their own narrative inspired by but not copying the class novel -- perhaps a parallel story, a prequel, or a story using similar themes in a different setting. Focus planning on character development: create a character profile using the same techniques the author uses. Plan the setting using sensory details.
**Spelling focus:** Possessive apostrophe continued. Irregular plurals: children's, women's, men's, people's.
**Key vocabulary:** character profile, setting, sensory detail, technique, model, plan, narrative, inspire, develop

### Lesson 26 -- Predicting and Revising Predictions
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C027 (Prediction), EN-Y4-C026 (Inference), EN-Y4-C025 (Questions to improve comprehension)
**Type:** Practice
**Approach:** Read the next section of the class novel. Return to earlier predictions: Which were confirmed? Which were wrong? What textual signals were helpful or misleading? Teach: good readers constantly revise predictions as new evidence emerges. Generate new predictions and new questions. Distinguish between questions the text answers, questions requiring inference, and questions deliberately left unanswered. Partner discussion using reciprocal reading roles: predictor, questioner, clarifier, summariser.
**Spelling focus:** Homophones: brake/break, grate/great, peace/piece. Memory aids created by children.
**Key vocabulary:** predict, revise, confirm, evidence, signal, question, literal, inferential, unanswered, reciprocal

### Lesson 27 -- Drafting Narrative: Building Plot and Tension
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C046 (Narrative elements), EN-Y4-C044 (Oral rehearsal), EN-Y4-C045 (Paragraphing)
**Type:** Practice
**Approach:** Drawing on the class novel as a model, focus on plot development: problem, complication, climax, resolution. Shared writing of a tense scene, modelling oral rehearsal of each sentence. Teach paragraphing in narrative: new paragraph for change of time, place, topic, or speaker. Children draft their stories, focusing on building tension through short sentences, powerful verbs, and well-placed dialogue. Circulate to support pacing: "Are you rushing the exciting part? Slow down -- make the reader wait."
**Spelling focus:** Statutory word list in writing context. Children check for Y3/4 words in their drafts.
**Key vocabulary:** plot, tension, complication, climax, resolution, paragraph, pace, rehearse, dialogue, draft

### Lesson 28 -- Themes and the Whole Text
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C020 (Themes and conventions), EN-Y4-C064 (Justifying views), EN-Y4-C031 (Discussion about books)
**Type:** Practice
**Approach:** We are now well into the class novel. Discuss: "What is this book really about? Not just the plot -- the deeper themes." Use a theme-tracking grid: children identify evidence for the main theme from different parts of the book. Class discussion: Do we all agree on the main theme? Can a book have more than one theme? How does this book's themes compare to themes in our myths and legends? Children write a reading response: "I think the main theme of this book is... because..." with at least three pieces of textual evidence.
**Spelling focus:** Dictation (C039): 3 sentences including statutory words and possessive apostrophes.
**Key vocabulary:** theme, evidence, track, compare, justify, opinion, interpret, perspective, text, deeper meaning

### Lesson 29 -- Evaluating and Editing Narrative Writing
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C048 (Evaluating writing), EN-Y4-C049 (Editing for vocabulary), EN-Y4-C050 (Proof-reading), EN-Y4-C051 (Reading aloud own writing)
**Type:** Practice / Assessment
**Approach:** Children evaluate their narrative against success criteria: character developed through action and dialogue, setting described with sensory detail, tension built at climax, clear paragraphing, varied sentence structures. Read aloud to a partner -- does it sound right? Does the partner want to keep listening? Edit: replace weak vocabulary, improve dialogue, tighten pacing. Proof-read for spelling, punctuation (especially speech marks), and grammar. This lesson serves as a mid-year assessment of composition skills.
**Spelling focus:** Proof-reading. Check all homophones and possessive apostrophes in own narrative writing.
**Key vocabulary:** evaluate, edit, proof-read, success criteria, revise, strengthen, pace, voice, publish

---

## Unit 5: Non-fiction -- Persuasion and Discussion (Weeks 17-20)
**Anchor texts:** Persuasive texts, letters, adverts, balanced argument texts (cross-curricular link to topic work)
**Reading focus:** Summarising, structure and presentation, justifying views, discussion
**Writing focus:** Persuasive letter and balanced discussion text
**Spelling focus:** Statutory word list, dictation

---

### Lesson 30 -- Reading Persuasive Texts
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C017 (Reading for different purposes), EN-Y4-C029 (Language, structure and presentation), EN-Y4-C022 (Effective language)
**Type:** New content
**Approach:** Examine several persuasive texts: a charity appeal letter, an advert, a campaign leaflet. How is persuasive writing different from information writing? Analyse language features: emotive language, rhetorical questions, direct address ("you"), rule of three, expert opinions. Analyse structural features: bold headings, images with captions, call to action. Children annotate a persuasive text, identifying how language and structure work together to persuade. Discuss: "Is this text trying to inform you or persuade you? How can you tell?"
**Spelling focus:** Statutory word list (C036) -- persuasion vocabulary: believe, consider, continue, important, particular, possible, purpose, suppose.
**Key vocabulary:** persuade, emotive, rhetorical question, direct address, audience, purpose, structure, presentation, technique

### Lesson 31 -- Summarising Arguments and Identifying Bias
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C028 (Summarising main ideas), EN-Y4-C025 (Questions to improve comprehension), EN-Y4-C064 (Justifying views)
**Type:** Practice
**Approach:** Read a balanced discussion text on a topic children have opinions about (e.g., "Should children have homework?"). Summarise the arguments on each side. Teach: in a balanced text, the writer presents both sides before reaching a conclusion. But is the writer truly balanced? Generate evaluative questions: "Has the writer given equal weight to both sides? What evidence have they used? Have they left out any important arguments?" Children justify their own view on the topic with evidence, distinguishing between personal opinion and evidenced argument.
**Spelling focus:** Statutory word list in extended writing. Personal spelling logs updated.
**Key vocabulary:** summarise, argument, balanced, bias, evidence, opinion, evaluate, justify, perspective, conclusion

### Lesson 32 -- Planning and Drafting a Persuasive Letter
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C042 (Planning from model texts), EN-Y4-C043 (Generating ideas), EN-Y4-C045 (Paragraphing), EN-Y4-C047 (Organisational devices)
**Type:** Practice
**Approach:** Analyse a model persuasive letter: greeting, opening statement of position, paragraphs with arguments and evidence, concluding call to action, sign-off. Children plan a persuasive letter on a topic of their choice (e.g., writing to the head teacher about a school issue). Plan using the model structure: introduction (state your position), three argument paragraphs (reason + evidence), conclusion (what you want to happen). Teach formal letter layout. Begin drafting.
**Spelling focus:** Dictation (C039): 3 sentences from a persuasive context including statutory words and homophones.
**Key vocabulary:** persuasive letter, formal, argument, evidence, position, paragraph, greeting, conclusion, call to action

### Lesson 33 -- Drafting and Editing a Balanced Discussion
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C045 (Paragraphing), EN-Y4-C047 (Organisational devices), EN-Y4-C044 (Oral rehearsal), EN-Y4-C049 (Editing for vocabulary)
**Type:** Practice
**Approach:** Shared writing of a balanced discussion text introduction. Model: state the question, explain why it matters, preview both sides. Children draft their own balanced discussion on a different topic. Teach linking language for balanced writing: "On the one hand... On the other hand...", "Some people argue that... However, others believe...", "While it is true that... it is also important to consider..." Oral rehearsal of linking sentences. Edit for formal vocabulary: replace informal words with formal alternatives.
**Spelling focus:** Etymological patterns (C035): -tion/-sion/-ssion/-cian endings. Connect to formal vocabulary: discussion, persuasion, possession, politician.
**Key vocabulary:** balanced discussion, introduction, argument, counter-argument, linking language, formal, however, furthermore

### Lesson 34 -- Retrieval Research Project
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C030 (Retrieving and recording from non-fiction), EN-Y4-C018 (Dictionary use), EN-Y4-C031 (Discussion about books)
**Type:** Practice
**Approach:** Cross-curricular research task. Children retrieve information from multiple sources to support their persuasive or discussion writing. Teach cross-referencing: Do your sources agree? Model note-taking with source attribution. Use dictionaries for unfamiliar technical vocabulary. Children discuss their findings in groups: "What did you find? Where did you find it? Do your sources agree?" This lesson integrates reading retrieval skills with writing composition needs. Update or improve writing based on new information found.
**Spelling focus:** Dictionary use for spelling (C038). Children verify spellings of technical vocabulary in dictionaries.
**Key vocabulary:** retrieve, research, source, cross-reference, note-taking, paraphrase, dictionary, verify, attribute

### Lesson 35 -- Publishing and Presenting Non-fiction Writing
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C051 (Reading aloud own writing), EN-Y4-C050 (Proof-reading), EN-Y4-C048 (Evaluating writing)
**Type:** Consolidation / Assessment
**Approach:** Final proof-read of persuasive letter or balanced discussion. Check: formal tone maintained, arguments logical, evidence included, paragraphing clear, organisational devices used, spelling and punctuation accurate. Produce a final version. Read aloud to the class with appropriate formal tone. Peer evaluation: "Was the argument convincing? What was the strongest point? What would make it even more persuasive?" This lesson assesses composition across the non-fiction writing process.
**Spelling focus:** Full spelling check of final pieces. Apply all strategies: statutory words, homophones, etymological patterns, possessive apostrophes.
**Key vocabulary:** publish, present, formal tone, convince, proof-read, final draft, feedback, evaluate, audience

## Unit 6: Traditional Stories and Poetry Revisited (Weeks 21-23)
**Anchor texts:** Traditional stories from new cultures (e.g., Indian folktales, Caribbean stories, Japanese legends), plus poetry anthology revisited
**Reading focus:** Inference, prediction, poetry revisited, silent reading stamina
**Writing focus:** Narrative writing with dialogue; own poetry
**Spelling focus:** Etymological patterns, dictation

---

### Lesson 36 -- Legends: Fact, Fiction and Cultural Significance
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C019 (Fairy stories, myths and legends), EN-Y4-C026 (Drawing inferences with evidence), EN-Y4-C020 (Themes and conventions)
**Type:** Practice
**Approach:** Read a legend (blending historical fact with fictional elaboration -- e.g., Robin Hood, King Arthur, or a legend from another culture). How is a legend different from a myth? (Legends have some historical basis; myths explain the world through supernatural stories.) Infer: What does this legend tell us about the values of the culture that created it? Find evidence in the text. Compare themes with myths studied in Unit 1. Children are now expected to identify themes independently and support their analysis with textual evidence.
**Spelling focus:** Etymological patterns (C035): -sure/-ture endings (measure, treasure, adventure, creature, furniture).
**Key vocabulary:** legend, historical, cultural significance, infer, evidence, theme, compare, values, tradition, analyse

### Lesson 37 -- Poetry for Two Voices
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C021 (Poetry and play performance), EN-Y4-C023 (Forms of poetry), EN-Y4-C044 (Oral rehearsal)
**Type:** Practice
**Approach:** Introduce poems for two voices (e.g., Joyful Noise by Paul Fleischman or similar). Pairs rehearse and perform a poem, making deliberate performance choices about which lines are read together, which separately, and how to use pause and emphasis. Then children write their own poem for two voices on a topic linked to a legend or traditional story studied. Oral rehearsal is essential: "Read it aloud with your partner. Does it work? Where do you need to adjust?" Focus on how the two-voice form creates dialogue, contrast, or echo.
**Spelling focus:** Dictation (C039): sentences from traditional stories including all Y3/4 spelling patterns.
**Key vocabulary:** poem for two voices, contrast, echo, rehearse, perform, form, dialogue, deliberate choice, pace

### Lesson 38 -- Year-End Reading and Writing Celebration
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C065 (Silent reading), EN-Y4-C016 (Wide reading), EN-Y4-C051 (Reading aloud own writing), EN-Y4-C064 (Justifying views), EN-Y4-C031 (Discussion about books)
**Type:** Consolidation / Assessment
**Approach:** A celebration of reading and writing across the year. Children present their best piece of writing from any unit, reading it aloud to the class. Book recommendations: each child recommends a book they read this year, justifying their choice with specific reasons and evidence from the text. Discuss: "How has your reading changed this year? What have you enjoyed? What challenged you? What do you want to read next?" Final reading journal entry reflecting on the year. Silent reading of free-choice books.
**Spelling focus:** Personal spelling log review. Children identify patterns in their own errors across the year.
**Key vocabulary:** celebrate, recommend, justify, reflect, progress, achievement, independent, reader, writer, journey
