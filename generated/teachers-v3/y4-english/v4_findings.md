# V4 Findings: Y4 English Evaluation
## Ms Chioma Okonkwo — Year 4 Class Teacher, English Lead & Reading Coordinator

### Summary Verdict

The graph gives me an excellent **curriculum skeleton** — I can see every statutory objective, every concept, and how they connect. The concept-level detail (teaching guidance, misconceptions, vocabulary) is genuinely strong. But English is not a subject you can teach from a skeleton alone. The graph knows *what* to teach. It does not know *how English actually works in a classroom* — which is through texts.

---

## What the Graph Does Well

### 1. Curriculum coverage is complete and accurate
All 7 domains are present and correctly structured:
- Spoken Language (12 concepts)
- Reading — Word Reading (3 concepts)
- Reading — Comprehension (18 concepts)
- Writing — Spelling (8 concepts)
- Writing — Handwriting (2 concepts)
- Writing — Composition (10 concepts)
- Writing — Vocabulary, Grammar & Punctuation (12 concepts)

Total: 65 concepts across 7 domains. Every statutory objective from the 2014 National Curriculum is accounted for. I checked. This is solid.

### 2. The teaching guidance is genuinely useful
Each concept has teaching guidance, common misconceptions, and key vocabulary. This is not generic — it reads like it was written by someone who has taught primary English. Examples:
- The guidance for EN-Y4-C026 (Drawing inferences with evidence) correctly identifies the "inference equation" and the common confusion between inference and retrieval
- The misconceptions for EN-Y4-C057 (Direct speech punctuation) accurately capture the comma-before-closing-speech-mark error and the interrupted speech pattern difficulty
- The vocabulary lists are age-appropriate and curriculum-aligned

### 3. The reading-writing connections are explicitly modelled
The cross-domain CO_TEACHES relationships between Reading Comprehension (D003) and Writing Composition (D006) are excellent. There are 7 curated cross-domain links, and they capture exactly the connections I teach:
- Fairy stories/myths (reading) feeds into narrative elements (writing)
- Language/structure analysis (reading) feeds into paragraphing and organisational devices (writing)
- Justifying views about reading parallels evaluating own writing
- Effective language in texts feeds into editing for grammar and vocabulary

These are labelled with my name ("Okonkwo") — clearly curated by someone who understands the reading-writing connection. This is the single strongest feature of the graph for English.

### 4. The concept clustering makes pedagogical sense
The clusters follow a sensible teaching sequence within each domain. For example, in Composition:
1. Plan, generate ideas, rehearse orally (introduction)
2. Structure using paragraphs and conventions (practice)
3. Evaluate, edit and present (practice)

This mirrors how I actually teach writing units. The sequencing is defensible.

### 5. The assessment mapping is useful
The Grammar/Punctuation domain (D007) has 11 Content Domain Codes mapped from KS2 test frameworks. This is practically useful — I can see exactly which concepts are formally assessed and how. For example:
- G5.7 (direct speech punctuation) maps to EN-Y4-C057
- G3.2 (expanded noun phrases) maps to EN-Y4-C058
- G7.1 (Standard English verb forms) maps to EN-Y4-C060

Only grammar/punctuation has these codes, though — reading comprehension content domains are missing (see gaps below).

### 6. Learner profile data is detailed and appropriate
The KS2 learner profile gives me:
- Content guidelines: Lexile 150-350, max 14-word sentences, FK grade max 2
- Pedagogy: 12-20 min sessions, challenge-first with productive failure, interleaving
- Feedback: warm competence-focused, specific skill naming, normalise struggle
- Interaction types: 15 available, 6 primary

The agent instructions are well-written and would genuinely help an AI present content appropriately for 8-9 year olds.

## What Is Missing — And Why It Matters

### CRITICAL GAP 1: No texts, no text recommendations, no reading spine

This is the single biggest problem for English. **You cannot teach English without texts.**

The graph knows I need to teach "drawing inferences with evidence" (EN-Y4-C026) and "fairy stories, myths and legends" (EN-Y4-C019). But it cannot tell me:
- Which texts to use
- What a good model text for Year 4 narrative writing looks like
- Which poems to perform for EN-Y4-C021
- Which non-fiction texts to use for retrieval practice (EN-Y4-C030)
- What a Year 4-appropriate reading comprehension passage looks like

In English, **the text IS the lesson**. A reading comprehension lesson is not "teach inference" — it's "read Chapter 3 of The Iron Man and explore why the Iron Man returns to the cliff." The graph gives me the skill but not the vehicle.

**Impact on content generation:** An AI cannot generate a reading comprehension lesson without knowing which text the child is reading. It cannot generate a writing task without providing or referencing a model text. It cannot assess reading without a passage.

**What's needed:** A text/resource layer — even at the level of genre/text-type recommendations per cluster. E.g., "EN-Y4-D003-CL002 (literary themes and forms) — suitable texts: myths from diverse traditions, classic fiction with clear themes, narrative poetry." Oak National Academy integration would partially solve this.

### CRITICAL GAP 2: No reading comprehension content domain codes

The grammar/punctuation domain has KS2 test framework codes, but the reading comprehension domain does NOT. The KS2 Reading SAT uses content domains:
- 2a: Give/explain the meaning of words in context
- 2b: Retrieve and record information
- 2c: Summarise main ideas
- 2d: Make inferences from the text
- 2e: Predict what might happen
- 2f: Identify how information contributes to meaning
- 2g: Identify how language contributes to meaning
- 2h: Make comparisons within the text

These map directly to concepts in D003 (Reading Comprehension), but the mapping is not in the graph. The epistemic skills (RS-KS2-2a through 2h) partially cover this, but they're not linked to specific content domain codes in the assessment layer. This means the graph can't generate targeted reading test practice.

**What's needed:** Map the KS2 Reading content domains to the comprehension concepts, the same way grammar content domains are mapped.

### CRITICAL GAP 3: No genre/text-type taxonomy

The composition domain (D006) asks children to write narratives AND non-fiction. But the graph has no explicit genre taxonomy. Year 4 children write:
- Narrative (adventure, mystery, myth retelling, historical fiction)
- Recount (diary, newspaper report, biography)
- Information report
- Explanation text
- Persuasion (letter, speech, advertisement)
- Discussion text
- Poetry (various forms)
- Play scripts

These genres drive half-termly planning. A writing unit is typically: immersion in a genre through reading model texts → analysis of genre features → planning → drafting → revising → publishing. The graph knows about paragraphing, narrative elements, and organisational devices — but doesn't know that these are applied differently in a newspaper report versus an adventure story.

**Impact on content generation:** Without genre knowledge, the AI can generate generic "write a paragraph" tasks but cannot generate "write a newspaper report about the eruption of Vesuvius" with the correct structural features, vocabulary, and audience awareness.

### SIGNIFICANT GAP 4: No cross-curricular content links

English is the most cross-curricular subject. Reading comprehension texts come from:
- **Science**: Non-fiction texts about habitats, materials, electricity
- **History**: Recounts, biographies, diary entries from historical periods
- **Geography**: Information texts about rivers, volcanoes, settlements
- **RE**: Myths and legends from world religions

Writing tasks are contextualised through other subjects:
- Write a diary entry as a Roman soldier (History)
- Write an explanation text about the water cycle (Geography/Science)
- Write a persuasive letter about deforestation (Geography)

The graph has NO cross-subject links for English. There are cross-domain links within English (reading ↔ writing), but nothing connecting English to History, Science, or Geography concepts. This is a fundamental gap for primary English teaching, where topic work drives much of the reading and writing curriculum.

**What's needed:** Cross-subject CO_TEACHES or CONTEXTUALISES relationships. E.g., History topic "Roman Britain" CONTEXTUALISES EN-Y4-C046 (narrative elements) and EN-Y4-C030 (retrieving information from non-fiction).

### SIGNIFICANT GAP 5: No vocabulary progression or word lists

The graph mentions "key vocabulary" per concept (grammatical/pedagogical terms), but there's no:
- Year 4 high-frequency word list (beyond the statutory spelling list)
- Tier 2 academic vocabulary progression
- Subject-specific vocabulary banks for cross-curricular writing
- Vocabulary grouped by topic or text type

Vocabulary is the single strongest predictor of reading comprehension. The graph has EN-Y4-C003 (Vocabulary building strategies) and EN-Y4-C063 (Figurative language and academic vocabulary), but no actual vocabulary content to build strategies around.

### SIGNIFICANT GAP 6: No phonics/fluency assessment data for word reading

The word reading domain (D002) has only 3 concepts (roots, prefixes/suffixes, exception words) and no assessment codes. For Year 4, this is a problem because:
- Some children are still working below age-related expectations in decoding
- The Year 4 Multiplication Tables Check gets attention, but reading fluency is equally critical
- There's no fluency benchmark (words-per-minute target, accuracy threshold)
- The graph can't identify which children still need phonics intervention vs. those ready for pure comprehension focus

### MODERATE GAP 7: Spoken language is disconnected

Spoken Language (D001) has 12 concepts and 3 clusters, but:
- No CO_TEACHES links to other English domains (reading, writing)
- No explicit connection between spoken language and reading comprehension (discussion, book talk)
- No link between oral rehearsal (in D006) and the spoken language skills that underpin it

In practice, spoken language is the foundation of everything in English. Discussion improves comprehension. Oral rehearsal improves writing. Drama improves inference. These connections should be explicit.

### MODERATE GAP 8: Handwriting is in the graph but probably shouldn't be in the AI

The handwriting domain (D005) has 2 concepts about joining strokes and fluency. This is a physical motor skill that an AI platform cannot teach or assess. It's curriculum-accurate but useless for content generation. Consider flagging handwriting concepts as `ai_non_deliverable` or similar.

## Can the Graph Generate Specific Content Types?

### Reading Comprehension Lesson
**Can it?** Partially. It knows the skills (inference, prediction, retrieval, summarising) and can sequence them. It knows the learner profile (sentence length, vocabulary level, feedback style). But it CANNOT provide or recommend a text to read, which is the entire point of a reading lesson.

**Verdict:** The graph provides the **skill framework** but not the **content vehicle**. An AI would need to either: (a) access a text library and match texts to concepts, or (b) generate age-appropriate passages — but the graph gives no genre, topic, or complexity guidance for passage selection/generation.

### Writing Task / Model Text
**Can it?** Weakly. It knows the composition process (plan → draft → revise → edit → publish) and the structural requirements (paragraphs, narrative elements, organisational devices). The cross-domain links to reading are genuinely helpful. But without genre taxonomy, text-type features, or model texts, it can only generate generic writing scaffolds, not specific tasks.

**Verdict:** Could generate a generic "write a narrative with setting, character and plot" task. Cannot generate "write a myth retelling using the hero's journey structure, modelled on Theseus and the Minotaur."

### Spelling Test
**Can it?** Yes — this is the strongest area. The statutory word list is referenced (EN-Y4-C036), spelling patterns are detailed (etymology, homophones, prefixes/suffixes), and the misconceptions are specific. An AI could generate spelling tests using the statutory word list, test homophones in sentence context, and create dictation exercises.

**Verdict:** Graph is sufficient for spelling assessment generation. The concepts, word lists, and misconception data are all present.

### Grammar Quiz
**Can it?** Yes, and well. The grammar/punctuation domain (D007) has 12 detailed concepts, 11 assessment content domain codes, and rich misconception data. An AI could generate grammar questions targeting specific content domains (fronted adverbials, direct speech punctuation, expanded noun phrases) with distractors based on documented misconceptions.

**Verdict:** Graph is sufficient for grammar assessment generation. This is where the assessment layer really shines.

### Teaching Resources (Lesson Slides, Frameworks)
**Can it?** Partially. The cluster sequencing provides a lesson sequence. The teaching guidance provides pedagogical direction. The learner profile provides presentation constraints. But slides need visual content, model texts, example sentences, and worked examples — none of which are in the graph.

**Verdict:** Could generate lesson structure and scaffolds. Cannot generate complete teaching resources without supplementary content.

## Comparison with US Standards (CASE Reference)

The CASE standards reference is disappointingly thin for English. It contains NGSS (science) and Common Core Math, but NO Common Core ELA standards. The CC ELA standards are referenced in cluster rationales ("Inspired by: CC ELA RL.4.1") but the actual standards are not in the graph. This means:
- No UK-US alignment analysis is possible for English
- The "Inspired by" references in clusters are useful but one-directional
- The 0 alignment relationships noted in the reference confirms this gap

This is a missed opportunity. Common Core ELA has useful structural differences from the UK curriculum (particularly in informational text standards and writing standards) that would enrich the graph.

---

## Recommendations (Priority Order)

1. **Add a text/resource layer** — Even minimal: genre recommendations per cluster, suggested text types, example text characteristics. This is non-negotiable for English content generation.

2. **Map KS2 Reading content domain codes** to D003 comprehension concepts — Same pattern as the grammar codes already mapped to D007.

3. **Add genre/text-type taxonomy** — Narrative sub-genres, non-fiction text types, poetry forms. Link to composition clusters and reading clusters.

4. **Add cross-subject contextualisation links** — English reading and writing are always contextualised through other subjects. Even high-level links (EN-Y4-D003 uses texts about [History topic]) would help.

5. **Add Common Core ELA to CASE layer** — The graph references CC ELA standards but doesn't contain them. This limits cross-system analysis.

6. **Add spoken language cross-domain links** — Connect D001 concepts to the reading and writing concepts they directly support.

7. **Flag handwriting as AI-non-deliverable** — Save processing and avoid generating meaningless handwriting content.

8. **Add Tier 2 vocabulary banks** — Per half-term or per topic, aligned to cross-curricular themes.

## Half-Term Planning Exercise

**Task:** Plan a half-term (6 weeks) of English using only graph data.

**What I can plan:**
- Week-by-week concept coverage using cluster sequencing
- Grammar focus for each week (from D007 clusters)
- Spelling patterns to teach and test (from D004 clusters)
- Reading skills to develop (from D003 clusters)
- Composition process stages (from D006 clusters)
- Session structure and interaction types (from learner profile)

**What I cannot plan:**
- Which class novel to read
- Which model texts to use for each writing genre
- Which non-fiction texts to use for comprehension
- Which poems to study and perform
- Cross-curricular topic links (what is the half-term topic?)
- Specific vocabulary to pre-teach for each text
- Reading assessment passages

**Verdict:** I can plan the **skills curriculum** but not the **content curriculum**. In English, these are inseparable. A half-term plan that says "Week 3: Teach inference (EN-Y4-C026)" without specifying "using Chapter 5 of The Firework-Maker's Daughter" is a framework, not a plan.

## Final Assessment

The graph is an **excellent curriculum reference tool** for Year 4 English. The concept detail, misconception data, prerequisite chains, and cross-domain reading-writing links are genuinely impressive — better than most published schemes of work I've seen.

But for **content generation** — which is the stated goal — it's missing the most fundamental thing: texts. English is a text-driven subject. Every lesson begins with a text (read, heard, or written). The graph models the skills beautifully but has no concept of the texts that deliver those skills.

**Analogy:** The graph is like having a brilliant lesson plan template with every learning objective specified, every misconception anticipated, every assessment criterion defined — but with a blank space where it says "Text: ___________". That blank space is where 80% of the teaching happens.

The spelling and grammar domains are closest to being content-generation-ready, because those domains are more rule-based and less text-dependent. Reading and writing composition are the furthest from ready.

**Score: 7/10 for curriculum accuracy. 4/10 for content generation readiness in English specifically.**

The path to 8/10 for content generation: add texts, genres, and cross-curricular links.
