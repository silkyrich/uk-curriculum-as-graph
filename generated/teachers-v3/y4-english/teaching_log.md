# Teaching Log -- Miss Okonkwo, Year 4 English (v3)
## Planning across: Reading Comprehension (EN-Y4-D003), Spelling (EN-Y4-D004), Writing Composition (EN-Y4-D006)

**Date:** February 2026
**Context:** This is my second pass through the graph data. The first time, I fed back two main criticisms: the assessment clusters were bloated and impractical, and the three English domains were treated as isolated silos with no cross-domain connections. I have been told both issues have been addressed. Let me see.

---

## 1. Initial Observations on the Graph Data

### 1.1 What has changed

The difference is immediately visible. I now have 10 clusters across 3 domains, down from 17 last time. The breakdown:

- **Reading Comprehension (EN-Y4-D003):** 4 clusters (was 8 including assessment and consolidation)
- **Spelling (EN-Y4-D004):** 3 clusters (was 4)
- **Writing Composition (EN-Y4-D006):** 3 clusters (was 5)

Every assessment cluster has been removed. Every consolidation cluster has been removed. What remains is introduction and practice types only. This is a significant structural improvement. Last time, the assessment clusters alone accounted for roughly half the total suggested lesson time -- 77 out of 170 cluster-lessons were assessment or consolidation. That was the single biggest problem with the v2 data.

On the cross-domain front, there are now 7 curated CO_TEACHES connections linking Reading Comprehension to Writing Composition. Each has a reason type (feeds_into, shared_context, or parallel_concept) and a rationale written in my voice. More on those in section 3.

The concept count is unchanged: 18 in Reading, 8 in Spelling, 10 in Composition, 36 total. The within-domain CO_TEACHES relationships appear unchanged too. The prerequisite chains from Year 3 are intact. So the foundation data is the same -- it is the clustering and cross-domain layer that has been reworked.

### 1.2 First impressions

Good. The data now looks like something I could plan from, rather than something I have to plan around. Last time I spent most of my analysis rejecting clusters and explaining why standalone assessment blocks do not work in English. This time I can focus on whether the remaining clusters actually help me organise my teaching.

The concept descriptions, teaching guidance, misconceptions, and vocabulary are as strong as before. These remain the most useful part of the graph for a classroom teacher. If I were a newly qualified teacher planning Year 4 English for the first time, this context file would be genuinely valuable.

### 1.3 What is still missing

Before diving into the clusters, the same structural gaps persist:

- **Grammar domain (EN-Y4-D005) is absent.** Fronted adverbials, expanded noun phrases, speech punctuation, direct/indirect speech, possessive pronouns, determiners -- all of these are taught through composition. You cannot fully plan writing without grammar. This remains the biggest gap.
- **Handwriting domain is absent.** Year 4 children are expected to use a consistent, joined handwriting style. It is part of transcription and affects the pace of writing lessons.
- **No text suggestions.** The clusters describe what to teach but not what to teach it through. Text choice is arguably the most important planning decision an English teacher makes.
- **No cross-curricular links.** Non-fiction retrieval (C030) and organisational devices (C047) cry out for links to History, Geography, or Science, where children actually practise these skills in context.

I note, though, that the cross-domain CO_TEACHES rationales reference specific text types (fairy stories as models for narrative writing, non-fiction organisational features). That is a step in the right direction, even if it falls short of recommending actual titles.

## 2. Domain-by-Domain Cluster Analysis

### 2.1 Reading Comprehension (EN-Y4-D003) -- 4 clusters, 18 concepts

**EN-Y4-D003-CL001 -- Read widely to develop positive attitudes and reading stamina**
- Type: introduction
- Concepts: C016 (Wide reading for positive attitudes), C017 (Reading for different purposes and structures), C065 (Silent reading with understanding)
- Verdict: **FOLLOW with reduced lesson count.**

This is unchanged from v2 and my assessment is the same. These three concepts form the "engagement and independence" strand. They are the right concepts to introduce first. My issue is that they are dispositions and habits, not discrete teachable skills. I will allocate 2 lessons to launch them explicitly (book browse session, reading journal setup, discussion of reading purposes, silent reading expectations) and then sustain them daily throughout the year. The removal of any corresponding assessment cluster is welcome -- you do not assess "positive attitudes to reading" in a standalone block; you observe them over time.

One note: C065 (Silent reading with understanding) at complexity 3 and teaching weight 3 still feels high. Reading stamina is built through daily 15-20 minute sustained silent reading sessions, not through direct instruction. I would score this as weight 1 for explicit teaching and weight 3 for sustained practice time. The graph does not distinguish between these two modes of "teaching," which is a limitation for English planning specifically.

**EN-Y4-D003-CL002 -- Recognise literary themes, forms and effective language in texts**
- Type: practice
- Concepts: C018 (Dictionary use), C019 (Fairy stories/myths/legends), C020 (Themes and conventions), C021 (Poetry/play performance), C022 (Effective language), C023 (Forms of poetry)
- Sequenced after: CL001
- Verdict: **ADAPT -- I will split this into two teaching units.**

This remains the cluster I have the most tension with. Six concepts spanning dictionary use to poetry performance is simply too broad. The rationale says "C021 co_teach_hints list all others," and the within-domain CO_TEACHES data confirms that C021 connects to nearly everything in this cluster. But the fact that poetry performance is a vehicle for teaching many other skills is an argument for poetry being a separate unit, not for lumping everything together.

In practice, I will split this:

- **Myths and legends sub-unit** (C019 Fairy stories/myths/legends, C020 Themes and conventions, C022 Effective language, plus C018 Dictionary use introduced here). This is a narrative reading focus: we read Greek myths, West African Anansi stories, Norse legends, and analyse their themes, conventions, and language.
- **Poetry sub-unit** (C021 Poetry/play performance, C023 Forms of poetry, C022 Effective language revisited). This is a performance and form focus: we read, perform, and write poetry, exploring how form shapes meaning.

The CO_TEACHES data supports this split. C023 co-teaches with C018, C019, C020, C021, C024, C026, C027 -- but C023 and C021 form an especially tight pair (poetry forms and poetry performance are inseparable). Meanwhile C019 and C020 form their own natural pair (myths illustrate themes and conventions).

C018 (Dictionary use for reading comprehension) still sits oddly here. It is a tool skill. I will introduce it in the myths unit (where children encounter unfamiliar vocabulary from different cultures) and reinforce it throughout the year. It does not need cluster membership to be taught well.

**Improvement over v2:** The removal of the assessment cluster (old CL003) that used to follow this cluster is a clear improvement. Last time I had 15 lessons of practice followed by 15 lessons of assessment for the same 6 concepts -- 30 lessons for one cluster group. Now I have the practice cluster alone, which I can split and distribute as I see fit.

**EN-Y4-D003-CL003 -- Infer, predict and justify interpretations with textual evidence**
- Type: practice
- Concepts: C024 (Comprehension monitoring), C025 (Questions), C026 (Drawing inferences with evidence), C027 (Prediction from stated/implied detail), C064 (Justifying views independently)
- Sequenced after: CL002
- Verdict: **FOLLOW -- this is the strongest cluster in the set.**

My view is unchanged from v2. These five concepts are the interpretive skills that form the heart of Year 4 reading and the backbone of the KS2 assessment frameworks. They are correctly grouped. C025 (Questions) and C024 (Comprehension monitoring) pair as reciprocal reading strategies. C026 (Inference) and C027 (Prediction) pair as evidence-based skills. C064 (Justifying views) is the capstone that draws on all four. Teaching weights of 3 across the board are right -- these deserve sustained, explicit instruction.

In practice, I will introduce these skills explicitly in Unit 1 (myths provide rich inference opportunities -- why did Theseus volunteer? What does the Minotaur represent?) and then develop them across every subsequent unit with increasing independence. The sequencing after CL002 makes sense: children need the literary knowledge base (themes, conventions, language appreciation) before they can make sophisticated inferences about how those features work.

The removal of the old assessment cluster (CL005) and consolidation cluster (CL008) is especially welcome here. Last time, the graph suggested 14 lessons of practice, then 14 lessons of assessment, then 11 lessons of consolidation for these same 5 concepts -- 39 lessons total for one group of reading skills. That was nearly half a year. Now I have the practice cluster alone, and I can teach these skills through every text unit across the year, which is how it actually works.

**EN-Y4-D003-CL004 -- Summarise main ideas and analyse how language and structure contribute to meaning**
- Type: practice
- Concepts: C028 (Identifying and summarising main ideas), C029 (Language/structure/presentation contributing to meaning), C030 (Retrieving and recording from non-fiction), C031 (Discussion about books)
- Sequenced after: CL003
- Verdict: **FOLLOW.**

Strong cluster. These are correctly identified as higher-order synthesis skills that build on the interpretive skills in CL003. The sequencing makes pedagogical sense: children learn to infer, predict, and justify (CL003), then they learn to synthesise across paragraphs and analyse how authors achieve their effects (CL004).

I will teach this cluster primarily through non-fiction units, where summarising, retrieving, and analysing presentational features come together naturally. But C029 (Language, structure and presentation) has a fiction application too -- analysing how a novelist structures chapters or uses short sentences for tension. I will teach C029 in both fiction and non-fiction contexts.

C031 (Discussion about books) is an interesting inclusion. It underpins everything in the cluster -- you cannot teach summarising or analysis without discussion. But it is also a year-long habit, not a concept confined to one cluster. I would flag this as an "embedded" concept, like C016 (wide reading) in CL001.

### 2.2 Spelling (EN-Y4-D004) -- 3 clusters, 8 concepts

**EN-Y4-D004-CL001 -- Apply prefix and suffix spelling rules to derived words**
- Type: introduction
- Concepts: C032 (Prefixes and suffixes spelling rules), C033 (Suffix doubling rules for polysyllabic words)
- Verdict: **FOLLOW.**

Tight, correct grouping. Morphological spelling rules pair naturally. The within-domain CO_TEACHES between C033 and C037 (possessive apostrophe) via the doubling-rule connection is a nice detail that the rationale acknowledges. I will teach this in the first half-term alongside Unit 1 (myths), linking prefix vocabulary to myth content: impossible, immortal, incredible, inhuman. Three to four focused spelling sessions plus daily practice.

**EN-Y4-D004-CL002 -- Spell homophones and words from etymology-based and statutory lists**
- Type: practice
- Concepts: C034 (Homophones), C035 (Spelling patterns from various etymologies), C036 (Years 3-4 statutory word list)
- Sequenced after: CL001
- Verdict: **FOLLOW the grouping, DISTRIBUTE across the year.**

These three are all "learn and remember" spelling strands. Grouping them acknowledges their shared character: pattern recognition and memorisation. However, in practice, homophones and the statutory word list are taught in short daily/weekly sessions throughout the year, not in a single practice block. I will teach C035 (etymological patterns) more intensively as an investigation unit -- children love discovering that "chef" is French and "chorus" is Greek -- and distribute C034 and C036 across all units.

The removal of the old assessment cluster (CL003) is a clean improvement. Spelling assessment happens through weekly dictation and monitoring of independent writing. It does not need its own multi-lesson block.

**EN-Y4-D004-CL003 -- Use apostrophes, dictionaries and dictation to check and apply spelling**
- Type: practice
- Concepts: C037 (Possessive apostrophe with plural nouns), C038 (Dictionary use for spelling), C039 (Writing from dictation)
- Sequenced after: CL002
- Verdict: **FOLLOW the grouping, ADAPT the teaching.**

These are application skills -- tools for checking and demonstrating spelling competence. The grouping makes conceptual sense. In practice, I will teach possessive apostrophe (C037) in the context of writing, not as an isolated spelling lesson, because it is fundamentally a grammar-spelling crossover. Dictionary use for spelling (C038) pairs with C018 (dictionary use for reading), and I will teach them together. Dictation (C039) is my weekly assessment vehicle, used throughout the year.

No cross-domain CO_TEACHES links exist for the spelling domain. This is an area where a connection between C037 (possessive apostrophe) and the grammar domain would be valuable -- but since the grammar domain is not in the graph, there is nothing to connect to. If grammar were added, I would expect links between C037 and whatever covers apostrophe use in grammar, and between C039 (dictation) and the composition domain's C050 (proof-reading), since both involve checking accuracy in written sentences.

### 2.3 Writing Composition (EN-Y4-D006) -- 3 clusters, 10 concepts

**EN-Y4-D006-CL001 -- Plan, generate ideas and rehearse sentences orally before drafting**
- Type: introduction
- Concepts: C042 (Planning from model texts), C043 (Generating and recording ideas), C044 (Oral rehearsal of sentences including dialogue)
- Verdict: **FOLLOW the grouping, DISTRIBUTE across all units.**

These are the pre-writing skills. Every writing unit begins here: analyse a model text, generate ideas, rehearse sentences orally. The cluster correctly identifies them as the launch phase. But they are not taught in a single introductory block at the start of the year. I will model them explicitly in Unit 1 and then require them in every subsequent unit, with increasing independence. Two to three explicit lessons in Unit 1, then embedded.

The cross-domain CO_TEACHES linking C044 (Oral rehearsal) to C021 (Poetry and play performance) with reason "shared_context" is a good connection. More on this in section 3.

**EN-Y4-D006-CL002 -- Structure writing using paragraphs and narrative or non-fiction conventions**
- Type: practice
- Concepts: C045 (Paragraphing in composition), C046 (Narrative elements: setting, character and plot), C047 (Organisational devices in non-narrative writing)
- Sequenced after: CL001
- Verdict: **FOLLOW the grouping, SPLIT in practice.**

The cluster is conceptually sound: these are the three structural composition skills. But C046 (narrative elements) and C047 (non-fiction organisational devices) are taught in different text-type units. I teach narrative writing through fiction (myths, contemporary novels) and non-fiction writing through information and persuasion texts. Paragraphing (C045) spans both. So in practice, this cluster splits naturally across the year:

- Narrative units: C045 + C046
- Non-fiction units: C045 + C047

The removal of the old assessment cluster (CL003) is welcome. Writing is assessed through the pieces children produce, not through separate assessment lessons.

The cross-domain CO_TEACHES connections to this cluster are where the real value lies. C046 connects to C019 (Fairy stories/myths/legends) and C029 (Language/structure/presentation). C047 connects to C029. C045 connects to C029. These are the "reading feeds into writing" links I asked for last time. Section 3 will evaluate them properly.

**EN-Y4-D006-CL003 -- Evaluate, edit and present own writing effectively**
- Type: practice
- Concepts: C048 (Evaluating own and others' writing), C049 (Editing for grammar, vocabulary and consistency), C050 (Proof-reading), C051 (Reading aloud own writing)
- Sequenced after: CL002
- Verdict: **FOLLOW the grouping, DISTRIBUTE across all units.**

These are the revision and publication skills. Like the pre-writing cluster (CL001), every writing unit ends here: evaluate, edit, proof-read, publish/read aloud. The cluster is correct and complete. The within-domain CO_TEACHES relationships are rich: C050 (Proof-reading) links as "inverse_operations" to C042 (Planning), C047 (Organisational devices), and C048 (Evaluating). This framing -- proof-reading as the mirror of planning -- is useful for teaching children that these are not separate activities but two ends of the same process.

The cross-domain links here are strong too: C048 (Evaluating writing) connects to C064 (Justifying views about reading) as a "parallel_concept," and C049 (Editing) connects to C022 (Effective language in texts) as "feeds_into." Both feel right. More in section 3.

## 3. Cross-Domain Planning: Evaluating the New CO_TEACHES Links

This is the section that matters most. Last time, the absence of cross-domain connections was my single biggest criticism. I wrote: "The most important connections in English teaching are between reading and writing. Reading C022 (Effective language) should co-teach with Composition C049 (Editing for vocabulary). Reading C029 (Language/structure/presentation) should co-teach with Composition C045/C046/C047." I also asked for links between C021 and C044, C019 and C046, C064 and C048, and C031 and C048.

Let me evaluate each of the 7 cross-domain connections now provided.

### 3.1 The seven connections

**1. C019 (Fairy stories/myths/legends) to C046 (Narrative elements: setting, character, plot)**
Reason: feeds_into. Rationale: "Traditional story structures -- hero journey, resolution -- are the model for narrative composition."
**Assessment: Excellent.** This is exactly how I plan my myths unit. Children read myths, analyse the story structure (hero, quest, obstacle, resolution), and then use that structure as a template for their own narrative writing. The "feeds_into" label is correct -- reading is the input, writing is the output.

**2. C021 (Poetry/play performance) to C044 (Oral rehearsal of sentences including dialogue)**
Reason: shared_context. Rationale: "Performing poetry and plays directly connects to rehearsing sentences orally before writing."
**Assessment: Good, but slightly reductive.** The connection is real: both involve speaking text aloud with expression. But performing a published poem and rehearsing your own sentences before writing are different cognitive activities. The first is interpretive (understanding someone else's meaning), the second is compositional (shaping your own meaning). "Shared_context" is the right label -- they share the performative skill -- but I would add that C021 also feeds_into C051 (Reading aloud own writing), which is the performance of self-authored text. That connection is missing.

**3. C022 (Effective language in texts) to C049 (Editing for grammar, vocabulary and consistency)**
Reason: feeds_into. Rationale: "Analysing effective language in texts (reading) directly feeds into vocabulary choices when editing own writing."
**Assessment: Excellent.** This was at the top of my wish list. When children notice how an author uses a precise verb or an unexpected simile, they start looking for opportunities to do the same in their own editing. The "feeds_into" direction is correct. This connection is the engine of the reading-writing loop in English teaching.

**4. C029 (Language/structure/presentation) to C045 (Paragraphing in composition)**
Reason: feeds_into. Rationale: "Understanding how authors structure texts for meaning directly applies to composing structured paragraphs."
**Assessment: Good.** Correct connection, correct direction. When children analyse how a non-fiction author uses subheadings to organise information, they learn to paragraph their own non-fiction writing. When they see how a novelist uses a new paragraph to signal a shift in time or perspective, they apply that in narrative writing.

**5. C029 (Language/structure/presentation) to C046 (Narrative elements: setting, character, plot)**
Reason: feeds_into. Rationale: "Analysing narrative structure -- plots, settings, character arcs -- informs creating effective narratives."
**Assessment: Good.** This overlaps with connection 1 (C019 to C046) but from a different angle. C019 gives children the story templates (hero journey, quest, transformation). C029 gives them the analytical tools to understand how those templates work (why does the author withhold information? How does the flashback create suspense?). Both feed into C046. Having both connections is correct, not redundant.

**6. C029 (Language/structure/presentation) to C047 (Organisational devices in non-narrative writing)**
Reason: feeds_into. Rationale: "Non-fiction organisational features (headings, subheadings, bullet points) are learned through reading and applied in writing."
**Assessment: Excellent.** This is the non-fiction version of the reading-writing loop. Children encounter headings, subheadings, diagrams, bullet points, and captions in the non-fiction they read, and they apply these devices in the non-fiction they write. One of the most practical cross-domain connections for unit planning.

**7. C064 (Justifying views about reading) to C048 (Evaluating own and others' writing)**
Reason: parallel_concept. Rationale: "Children who can discuss books critically can evaluate writing critically."
**Assessment: Excellent.** The "parallel_concept" label is exactly right. These are the same critical thinking skill pointed in two directions: at published texts (C064) and at children's own writing (C048). In my classroom, children who can explain why an author's word choice is effective (reading) are the same children who can suggest specific vocabulary improvements in a peer's draft (writing). Teaching them together reinforces both.

### 3.2 Connections still missing

The 7 connections cover the major reading-to-writing links. But there are gaps:

1. **C021 (Poetry/play performance) to C051 (Reading aloud own writing).** Both involve performing text with expression. The shared performative skill is the same one acknowledged in connection 2, but C051 applies it to self-authored text. This is a natural "shared_context" link.

2. **C030 (Retrieving from non-fiction) to C047 (Organisational devices in non-narrative writing).** Children who can use contents pages, indexes, and headings to locate information (reading) understand why those features matter when they create their own non-fiction (writing). This is a "feeds_into" connection I use constantly.

3. **C031 (Discussion about books) to C048 (Evaluating own and others' writing).** I flagged this last time. The oral skills developed in book discussions (articulating opinions, supporting with evidence, considering alternatives) are the foundation for written evaluation of self and peer writing. "Feeds_into" or "shared_context."

4. **Spelling to Composition links are entirely absent.** C037 (Possessive apostrophe) relates to grammar in composition. C034 (Homophones) connects to C050 (Proof-reading) -- spotting homophone errors is a core proof-reading task. C039 (Dictation) connects to C050 as well -- both involve checking accuracy in written sentences. I understand these cross spelling-composition boundaries, but if we are connecting reading to writing, spelling to writing is just as important.

### 3.3 Do the rationales help?

Yes. The rationales are written in a voice attributed to me ("Okonkwo: '...'"), which is a slightly unusual framing -- I did not write them, the graph curators did. But the content is accurate and practical. Each rationale explains the pedagogical logic of the connection, not just the surface similarity. For example, the C022-to-C049 rationale does not just say "both involve vocabulary"; it says "Children who notice powerful word choices in reading apply them in revision." That is a teaching insight, not just a label.

The reason types (feeds_into, shared_context, parallel_concept) are a useful taxonomy. "Feeds_into" means reading skill X develops writing skill Y. "Shared_context" means skills X and Y are practised in the same activity. "Parallel_concept" means skills X and Y are the same cognitive operation applied to different objects. All three are distinct and pedagogically meaningful.

### 3.4 Does the graph now reflect integrated English teaching?

Better than before. Significantly better. The 7 cross-domain connections capture the most important reading-to-writing links and make the graph feel less like three isolated domains bolted together. A teacher using this data would see, for the first time, that teaching C029 (analysing language and structure) is not just a reading activity -- it feeds directly into C045 (paragraphing), C046 (narrative writing), and C047 (non-fiction writing).

But "better" is not "there." English is the most integrated subject in the primary curriculum. In my classroom, there is no moment when I am teaching "just reading" or "just writing." Every lesson involves reading, writing, speaking, listening, and often spelling and grammar, woven together through a shared text. The graph still presents domains as the primary organising structure, with cross-domain links as secondary annotations. In reality, the text-based unit is the primary organising structure, and domains are analytical categories applied retrospectively.

The ideal graph model for English would organise by teaching unit (text type or genre), with concepts from all domains clustered within each unit. The current model organises by domain, with cross-domain links added afterwards. It works, but it requires the teacher to do the integration work. The cross-domain CO_TEACHES connections make that integration work easier, which is a genuine improvement.

## 4. Overall Assessment

### 4.1 Rating: 7/10

Up from 5/10 last time. The two structural changes -- removing assessment clusters and adding cross-domain CO_TEACHES links -- address the two biggest problems I identified. The concept descriptions, teaching guidance, misconceptions, and vocabulary remain excellent (that was always an 8 or 9 out of 10 on its own). The cluster groupings are mostly sound, with CL002 (Reading) still too large and needing a split. The cross-domain connections capture the most important reading-writing links, though gaps remain. The spelling domain remains somewhat isolated.

### 4.2 Top 3 remaining gaps

1. **Grammar domain (EN-Y4-D005) is still absent.** This is the single most impactful addition possible. Composition cannot be fully planned without the grammar objectives that are taught through it. Fronted adverbials, expanded noun phrases, speech punctuation, direct/indirect speech, possessive pronouns, determiners, conjunctions -- all Year 4 grammar taught through writing. Until grammar is in the graph, composition planning is incomplete.

2. **Spelling-to-Composition cross-domain links are missing.** The graph now connects Reading to Composition, which is the most important link. But Spelling to Composition matters too. C037 (possessive apostrophe) is a grammar-spelling crossover taught through writing. C034 (homophones) and C050 (proof-reading) are deeply connected. C039 (dictation) practises both spelling and punctuation in sentence context. These links would complete the three-way integration.

3. **No "embedded vs. explicitly taught" distinction.** Concepts like C016 (wide reading for positive attitudes), C065 (silent reading), C031 (discussion about books), and C039 (dictation) are habits and routines sustained daily throughout the year. They need 1-2 introductory lessons but are then embedded in classroom culture. Other concepts like C026 (drawing inferences), C045 (paragraphing), and C032 (prefix/suffix rules) require sustained explicit instruction across multiple units. The graph treats all concepts the same way. A flag distinguishing "embedded" from "explicitly taught" concepts would help teachers allocate time more realistically.

### 4.3 Specific recommendations

1. **Split EN-Y4-D003-CL002.** Six concepts spanning dictionary use to poetry performance is too broad. Create two clusters: one for narrative literary knowledge (C019, C020, C022) and one for poetry and performance (C021, C023). Move C018 (dictionary use) to CL001 or flag it as a cross-cutting tool skill.

2. **Add 3-4 more cross-domain CO_TEACHES links.** Specifically: C021 to C051 (performance skills), C030 to C047 (non-fiction reading to writing), C031 to C048 (discussion to evaluation), and at least one Spelling-to-Composition link such as C034 to C050 (homophones to proof-reading).

3. **Add text-type or genre tags to clusters.** Tag CL002 (Reading) as "narrative: myths/legends + poetry." Tag CL004 (Reading) as "applicable across all text types." Tag D006-CL002 as "narrative (C046) and non-fiction (C047)." This would help teachers see which clusters from different domains can be taught together in a single unit.

4. **Add the Grammar domain.** Even a skeleton version with the 8-10 key Year 4 grammar concepts and CO_TEACHES links to Composition would make this data substantially more useful for planning.

5. **Add a "teaching mode" property to concepts.** Values: "explicit" (requires sustained direct instruction), "embedded" (introduced then sustained through daily practice), "tool" (taught once and applied across contexts). This would give teachers better time-allocation guidance than teaching weight alone.

### 4.4 Final reflection

The graph data has moved from "interesting but impractical" to "useful with adaptation." The concept-level content was always strong. The cluster-level organisation is now much closer to how English is actually taught. The cross-domain connections -- the 7 curated CO_TEACHES links -- are the single biggest improvement. They transform the data from three parallel domain sequences into something that begins to resemble integrated English planning.

I am still doing significant adaptation work: splitting CL002, distributing pre-writing and revision clusters across all units, adding my own text choices, filling in the grammar gaps, and building the actual unit plans. But the graph is now helping me think, not just giving me things to reject. That is genuine progress.

If the grammar domain is added and the remaining cross-domain links are completed, this could reach 8 or 9 out of 10 -- a genuinely useful planning tool for a Year 4 English teacher. For now, 7/10 reflects data that provides a strong conceptual foundation with practical gaps that an experienced teacher can fill, but that might leave a less experienced colleague still needing significant support.
