## Part A: Atoms, Elements and Compounds (SC-KS3-D007)

### Lesson 1 -- What is everything made of? Dalton's atomic model
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C072 (Dalton atomic model)
**Type:** New content
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D007-CL001 (followed)

Introduce the idea that all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms, using the historical context of Dalton's 1808 atomic theory. Pupils explore the four key ideas: all matter is made of atoms; atoms of the same element are identical; atoms of different elements differ in mass and properties; atoms combine in fixed ratios. Use molecular model kits to represent individual atoms and simple molecules. Working Scientifically: discuss how scientific models develop over time (Democritus to Dalton).

**Key vocabulary:** atom, Dalton, atomic theory, element, matter, particle, model, indivisible, mass, ratio

---

### Lesson 2 -- Atoms, elements and compounds: what is the difference?
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C073 (Atoms, elements, compounds)
**Type:** New content
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D007-CL001 (followed)

Using molecular models and diagrams, distinguish between atoms, elements, compounds, and molecules. An element is made of one type of atom; a compound contains two or more types of atom chemically bonded together; a molecule is two or more atoms bonded (can be element or compound). Sorting activity: classify substances (copper, O2, H2O, NaCl, diamond, air) as element, compound, or mixture. Demonstrate how the properties of a compound differ from its elements (sodium + chlorine versus sodium chloride).

**Key vocabulary:** atom, element, compound, molecule, chemical bond, substance, pure substance, mixture, properties, sodium chloride

---

### Lesson 3 -- Elements, compounds and mixtures: sorting and modelling
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C073 (Atoms, elements, compounds), SC-KS3-C072 (Dalton atomic model)
**Type:** Practice / consolidation
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D007-CL001 (followed, with added practice)

Practical lesson: pupils use molecular model kits to build models of elements (Fe, O2, N2), compounds (H2O, CO2, NaCl), and mixtures (air). They draw particle diagrams for each and write descriptions using the correct terminology. Card sort activity to classify substances. Address key misconception: a molecule does not have to contain different atoms -- O2 is a molecule of an element. Forward hook: briefly introduce the idea that mixtures can be separated physically, but compounds can only be separated by chemical reaction.

**Key vocabulary:** element, compound, mixture, molecule, particle diagram, chemical bond, physical separation, chemical reaction

---

### Lesson 4 -- The language of chemistry: chemical symbols
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C074 (Chemical symbols)
**Type:** New content
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D007-CL003 (followed)

Introduce the periodic table as a systematic arrangement of all known elements. Teach chemical symbols: one or two letters, first always capitalised (C, Ca, Co, Cu). Explain that some symbols come from Latin names (Fe from ferrum, Au from aurum, Na from natrium). Introduce simple chemical formulae: H2O, CO2, NaCl, CaCO3. Teach pupils to "read" formulae by counting atoms using subscript numbers. Periodic table treasure hunt activity: find elements by symbol, atomic number, or group.

**Key vocabulary:** chemical symbol, formula, subscript, periodic table, element, notation, Latin, atomic number, group, period

---

### Lesson 5 -- Naming compounds: chemical nomenclature
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C023 (Chemical nomenclature)
**Type:** New content
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D007-CL003 (followed)

Teach IUPAC naming conventions by connecting to symbols learned in Lesson 4. Rules: metal + non-metal compounds end in "-ide" (sodium chloride, magnesium oxide, iron sulfide); compounds containing oxygen from acids end in "-ate" or "-ite" (copper sulfate, calcium carbonate). Pupils practise naming compounds from formulae and writing formulae from names. Address misconception: "chlorine" (element) versus "chloride" (compound containing chlorine). Matching activity: common names to systematic names (table salt = sodium chloride, limestone = calcium carbonate, rust = iron oxide).

**Key vocabulary:** IUPAC, nomenclature, systematic name, -ide, -ate, -ite, formula, compound, element, binary compound

---

### Lesson 6 -- Symbols and naming: practice and application
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C074 (Chemical symbols), SC-KS3-C023 (Chemical nomenclature)
**Type:** Practice
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D007-CL003 (followed)

Extended practice lesson. Pupils work through progressively harder exercises: reading formulae, counting atoms, naming compounds, writing formulae from names. Include a "formula detective" challenge where pupils deduce the formula of an unknown compound from its properties and name. Periodic table quiz in pairs. Working Scientifically: using standard scientific conventions for representing chemical information. This lesson consolidates the "language tools" before moving to the practical chemistry of mixtures and separation.

**Key vocabulary:** formula, symbol, subscript, coefficient, nomenclature, periodic table, element, compound, naming convention

---

### Lesson 7 -- Checkpoint assessment: atoms, elements, compounds and chemical language
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C072, SC-KS3-C073, SC-KS3-C074, SC-KS3-C023
**Type:** Assessment
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D007-CL002 (deviated: reduced from 5 lessons to 1)

Low-stakes written assessment covering Dalton's model, classification of substances as elements/compounds/mixtures, reading and writing chemical formulae, and naming compounds. Includes particle diagram interpretation and a "spot the mistake" section targeting common misconceptions. Peer-marking with teacher-led feedback discussion. Results inform differentiation for subsequent lessons.

**Key vocabulary:** (revision of all vocabulary from Lessons 1-6)

---

### Lesson 8 -- Pure and impure: what does "pure" mean in science?
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C076 (Pure substances)
**Type:** New content
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D007-CL004 (followed, sub-sequence 1 of 3)

Define a pure substance as consisting of a single element or compound with a fixed, sharp melting and boiling point. Contrast with the everyday meaning of "pure" (e.g., "pure orange juice" is a mixture in scientific terms). Practical: measure the melting point of pure stearic acid versus a stearic acid/wax mixture to demonstrate that impurities lower and broaden the melting point. Record results in a table. Working Scientifically: making accurate measurements, recording data.

**Key vocabulary:** pure substance, impure, melting point, boiling point, sharp, range, purity, criterion, scientific definition, everyday definition

---

### Lesson 9 -- Mixtures and dissolving
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C077 (Mixtures)
**Type:** New content
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D007-CL004 (followed, sub-sequence 1 of 3)

Distinguish mixtures from pure substances: mixtures contain two or more substances not chemically combined, with variable composition, and the components retain their properties. Explore everyday examples: air (mixture of gases), seawater, alloys. Demonstrate dissolving: add salt to water and discuss what happens at the particle level. Introduce solute, solvent, solution, saturated solution. Address misconception: dissolving is not the same as melting, and dissolved substances do not "disappear" -- mass is conserved. Practical: make a saturated solution of copper sulfate and observe crystals forming.

**Key vocabulary:** mixture, dissolving, solute, solvent, solution, saturated, solubility, soluble, insoluble, alloy, composition

---

### Lesson 10 -- Separation techniques I: filtration and evaporation
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C079 (Separation techniques)
**Type:** New content (practical)
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D007-CL004 (followed, sub-sequence 2 of 3)

Practical lesson. Task: separate a mixture of sand, salt, and water. Pupils use filtration to remove the insoluble solid (sand) from the solution, then evaporation to recover the dissolved solid (salt). For each technique, explain the underlying physical principle: filtration separates by particle size; evaporation separates by boiling point differences. Pupils write up the method, draw a labelled diagram of apparatus, and record observations. Working Scientifically: planning enquiries, using appropriate apparatus, recording observations systematically.

**Key vocabulary:** filtration, evaporation, filter paper, residue, filtrate, insoluble, soluble, apparatus, method, separation

---

### Lesson 11 -- Separation techniques II: distillation
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C079 (Separation techniques)
**Type:** New content (practical)
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D007-CL004 (followed, sub-sequence 2 of 3)

Teacher demonstration of simple distillation: separate ink from water (or seawater to pure water). Explain the principle: the liquid with the lower boiling point evaporates first, the vapour is cooled and condensed in the Liebig condenser, and collected as a pure liquid. Pupils draw a labelled diagram of distillation apparatus. Discuss when distillation is needed versus evaporation (distillation is used when you want to keep the liquid, evaporation when you want the solid). Working Scientifically: evaluating methods, understanding why scientists choose particular techniques.

**Key vocabulary:** distillation, evaporation, condensation, Liebig condenser, boiling point, vapour, pure, separation, apparatus

---

### Lesson 12 -- Separation techniques III: chromatography
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C079 (Separation techniques), SC-KS3-C080 (Identifying pure substances)
**Type:** New content (practical)
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D007-CL004 (followed, sub-sequence 2-3 combined)

Practical: separate the dyes in food colouring or ink using paper chromatography. Pupils set up chromatography paper, apply spots, develop with water, and observe separation. Introduce the concepts of stationary phase (paper) and mobile phase (solvent), and explain that substances travel different distances based on their attraction to each phase. Calculate Rf values. Connect to identifying pure substances: a pure substance produces one spot; a mixture produces multiple spots. Address misconception: chromatography is not limited to inks -- it works with any mixture of dissolved substances.

**Key vocabulary:** chromatography, stationary phase, mobile phase, Rf value, solvent front, pure substance, mixture, separation, dye, food colouring

---

### Lesson 13 -- Identifying pure substances
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C080 (Identifying pure substances)
**Type:** New content / practice
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D007-CL004 (followed, sub-sequence 3 of 3)

Consolidate identification methods: melting/boiling point analysis (sharp = pure, range = impure) and chromatography (single spot = pure, multiple spots = mixture). Practical challenge: pupils are given an unknown white powder and must determine whether it is pure or a mixture using melting point data and chromatography. Discuss real-world applications: forensic science, food quality control, pharmaceutical testing. Working Scientifically: drawing conclusions from evidence, evaluating reliability of results.

**Key vocabulary:** identification, melting point, boiling point, chromatography, Rf value, pure, impure, forensic, quality control, evidence

---

### Lesson 14 -- Diffusion: particles on the move
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C078 (Diffusion in chemistry)
**Type:** New content
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D007-CL006 (deviated: taught here after mixtures, not paired with conservation of mass)

Connect diffusion to the particle model: in gases and liquids, particles move randomly. When there is a concentration difference, net movement occurs from high to low concentration. Teacher demonstration: bromine gas spreading in a gas jar (fume cupboard). Pupil practical: drop potassium permanganate crystal into still water and observe the colour spreading. Compare rates of diffusion in gases versus liquids. Address misconception: particles are not "pushed" -- diffusion results from random motion. Link to biological diffusion (if already taught). Working Scientifically: observing and recording changes over time, explaining observations using the particle model.

**Key vocabulary:** diffusion, particle, concentration, concentration gradient, random motion, net movement, gas, liquid, rate of diffusion, kinetic energy

---

### Lesson 15 -- End-of-topic assessment: atoms, elements, compounds, mixtures and separation
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C072, SC-KS3-C073, SC-KS3-C074, SC-KS3-C023, SC-KS3-C076, SC-KS3-C077, SC-KS3-C078, SC-KS3-C079, SC-KS3-C080
**Type:** Assessment
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D007-CL005 (deviated: reduced from 10 lessons to 1) + CL007 (removed)

Summative assessment covering the full D007 domain. Written paper (35 minutes) with structured questions, data interpretation (melting point data, chromatograms), and an extended answer question ("Describe how you would separate and identify the components of an unknown mixture"). Includes practical skills recall (diagram labelling, method description). Results used to identify pupils needing intervention before moving to chemical reactions.

**Key vocabulary:** (revision of all D007 vocabulary)

---

## Part B: Chemical Reactions (SC-KS3-D008)

### Lesson 16 -- What happens in a chemical reaction? Reactions as atom rearrangement
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C081 (Reactions as atom rearrangement)
**Type:** New content
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D008-CL001 (followed, with C075 integrated)

Introduce the key idea: in a chemical reaction, atoms in the reactants are rearranged to form new products. No atoms are created or destroyed. Use molecular models to demonstrate: break apart reactant models and rebuild them as product models. Show animations of reactions at the molecular level. Distinguish chemical changes (new substances formed, often irreversible) from physical changes (no new substances, often reversible). Burning magnesium demonstration: Mg + O2 produces MgO -- a new substance with completely different properties. Working Scientifically: understanding the development of scientific ideas.

**Key vocabulary:** chemical reaction, atom, rearrangement, reactant, product, bond breaking, bond forming, chemical change, physical change, new substance

---

### Lesson 17 -- Conservation of mass
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C075 (Conservation of mass)
**Type:** New content
**Cluster:** Deviated from D007-CL006 -- repositioned here in D008 after C081, following prerequisite chain

Demonstrate conservation of mass experimentally. Practical 1: react baking soda and vinegar in a sealed flask on a balance -- mass does not change. Practical 2: repeat in an open container -- apparent mass loss because CO2 gas escapes. This establishes that atoms are rearranged but not destroyed, so total mass is conserved. Confirm with ice melting (physical change, mass unchanged). Use particle diagrams to show that the same atoms are present before and after, just arranged differently. Address misconception: when wood burns, the "lost" mass has become CO2 and H2O gas. Working Scientifically: making measurements, controlling variables, explaining anomalous results.

**Key vocabulary:** conservation of mass, chemical reaction, reactant, product, sealed system, open system, gas, mass, balance, Lavoisier, rearrangement

---

### Lesson 18 -- Writing word equations
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C082 (Chemical equations)
**Type:** New content
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D008-CL001 (followed)

Introduce word equations as a way to summarise chemical reactions. Format: reactants -> products. Use the arrow to mean "reacts to form" (not "equals"). Practise with familiar reactions: methane + oxygen -> carbon dioxide + water; magnesium + oxygen -> magnesium oxide; calcium carbonate + hydrochloric acid -> calcium chloride + water + carbon dioxide. Emphasise reading the equation: what goes in, what comes out. Use the naming rules from Lesson 5 to predict product names.

**Key vocabulary:** word equation, reactant, product, arrow, chemical reaction, methane, combustion, decomposition

---

### Lesson 19 -- Writing symbol equations
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C082 (Chemical equations)
**Type:** New content
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D008-CL001 (followed)

Translate word equations into symbol equations using the formulae learned in Lessons 4-5. Start with simple examples: Mg + O2 -> MgO (unbalanced). Introduce state symbols: (s), (l), (g), (aq). Explain that symbol equations must be balanced to reflect conservation of mass -- the number of each type of atom must be equal on both sides. Address misconception: adjust coefficients (the big number in front), never subscripts (the small number below). Pupils practise writing and interpreting symbol equations.

**Key vocabulary:** symbol equation, formula, coefficient, subscript, state symbol, (s), (l), (g), (aq), balanced, unbalanced

---

### Lesson 20 -- Balancing equations: practice
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C082 (Chemical equations)
**Type:** Practice
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D008-CL001 (followed -- C082 has teaching weight 4, justifying extended practice)

Dedicated practice lesson for balancing chemical equations. Systematic method: list all atoms, count each side, adjust coefficients one element at a time, check. Use coloured counters or molecular models alongside written equations to reinforce the physical meaning. Progressively harder examples: 2-element reactions, then 3-element, then reactions with diatomic elements (H2, O2, N2, Cl2). Pair work with mini-whiteboards for rapid feedback. Working Scientifically: using mathematical conventions and modelling in science.

**Key vocabulary:** balanced equation, coefficient, conservation of mass, diatomic, atom count, systematic method

---

### Lesson 21 -- Checkpoint assessment: reactions, conservation of mass, and equations
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C081, SC-KS3-C075, SC-KS3-C082
**Type:** Assessment
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D008-CL002 (deviated: reduced from 7 lessons to 1)

Short written assessment: explain what happens to atoms in a chemical reaction, explain why mass is conserved, write and balance simple equations, interpret particle diagrams. Include a "fix the equation" task where pupils identify and correct errors in given equations. Mark and review in lesson to provide immediate feedback before moving to reaction types.

**Key vocabulary:** (revision of Lessons 16-20 vocabulary)

---

### Lesson 22 -- Types of reaction I: combustion and oxidation
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C083 (Types of reactions)
**Type:** New content
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D008-CL003 (followed, split across two lessons)

Define combustion: a substance reacts with oxygen, releasing energy (exothermic). Products of complete combustion of hydrocarbons: CO2 + H2O. Demonstrate burning magnesium ribbon (bright white flame, white powder MgO). Discuss oxidation more broadly: rusting is slow oxidation (iron + oxygen + water -> hydrated iron oxide). Address misconception: combustion does not always involve flames (rusting is flameless combustion/oxidation). Write word and symbol equations for each reaction. Connect to conservation of mass: the products of burning have greater mass than the solid remains because oxygen has been added.

**Key vocabulary:** combustion, oxidation, oxygen, oxide, fuel, hydrocarbon, carbon dioxide, water, exothermic, rust, iron oxide

---

### Lesson 23 -- Types of reaction II: thermal decomposition and displacement
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C083 (Types of reactions)
**Type:** New content (practical)
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D008-CL003 (followed)

Practical lesson. Thermal decomposition: heat copper carbonate (green) to produce copper oxide (black) + CO2. Test the gas with limewater to confirm CO2. Define: one substance breaks down into two or more simpler substances when heated. Displacement: add zinc metal to copper sulfate solution -- observe the blue solution fading and copper metal depositing. Define: a more reactive metal displaces a less reactive metal from a compound. Write word equations for both. Create a comparison table of all four reaction types. Working Scientifically: recording observations, writing conclusions, identifying patterns.

**Key vocabulary:** thermal decomposition, displacement, copper carbonate, copper oxide, zinc, copper sulfate, reactivity, limewater, word equation

---

### Lesson 24 -- Catalysts
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C088 (Catalysts)
**Type:** New content
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D008-CL003 (followed)

Demonstration: decompose hydrogen peroxide with and without manganese dioxide catalyst. Without catalyst: very slow bubbling. With catalyst: rapid fizzing, oxygen gas produced (test with glowing splint). Weigh the MnO2 before and after to show it is unchanged. Define catalyst: a substance that speeds up a reaction without being used up, by providing an alternative pathway with lower activation energy. Discuss biological catalysts (enzymes -- link to biology if taught). Mention industrial catalysts: iron in the Haber process, platinum in catalytic converters. Address misconception: catalysts do not make impossible reactions happen; they speed up reactions that would happen anyway.

**Key vocabulary:** catalyst, reaction rate, activation energy, manganese dioxide, hydrogen peroxide, enzyme, unchanged, alternative pathway, industrial catalyst

---

### Lesson 25 -- Acids and alkalis
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C084 (Acids and alkalis), SC-KS3-C085 (pH scale)
**Type:** New content (practical)
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D008-CL005 (followed -- C084 and C085 taught together as pH is the measurement tool for acids/alkalis)

Introduce acids (pH below 7) and alkalis (pH above 7) using common examples. Practical: test a range of household substances with universal indicator paper and solution -- lemon juice, vinegar, water, milk, soap, bicarbonate solution. Record the colour and pH value for each. Introduce the pH scale (0-14). Discuss the difference between strong/weak acids and concentrated/dilute acids. Address misconception: not all acids are dangerous (citric acid in lemons, ethanoic acid in vinegar). Working Scientifically: making measurements, recording results in a table, identifying patterns.

**Key vocabulary:** acid, alkali, neutral, pH scale, indicator, universal indicator, hydrogen ion, hydroxide ion, corrosive, dilute, concentrated, strong, weak

---

### Lesson 26 -- Acid + metal reactions
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C086 (Acid-metal reactions)
**Type:** New content (practical)
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D008-CL005 (followed)

Practical: react dilute hydrochloric acid with magnesium ribbon. Observe fizzing. Collect the gas and test with a burning splint -- the "squeaky pop" confirms hydrogen. General equation: acid + metal -> salt + hydrogen. Investigate with different metals (zinc, iron, copper): observe that some react vigorously, some slowly, some not at all -- this introduces the idea of reactivity. Discuss which acid determines which salt: HCl produces chlorides, H2SO4 produces sulfates. Write word equations for each reaction. Address misconception: not all metals react with dilute acids (copper, silver, gold do not).

**Key vocabulary:** acid, metal, salt, hydrogen, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, chloride, sulfate, reactive, unreactive, squeaky pop test

---

### Lesson 27 -- Neutralisation
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C087 (Neutralisation)
**Type:** New content (practical)
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D008-CL005 (followed)

Practical: slowly add dilute sodium hydroxide to dilute hydrochloric acid with universal indicator. Observe the colour change from red (acidic) through green (neutral, pH 7) to purple (alkaline). General equation: acid + alkali -> salt + water. Repeat with H2SO4 + NaOH to produce sodium sulfate. Discuss real-world applications: antacids neutralising stomach acid, treating acidic lakes, adjusting soil pH. Measure the temperature change during neutralisation (exothermic -- foreshadowing Lesson 28). Address misconception: neutralisation does not always give pH 7 unless exact proportions are used. Working Scientifically: controlling variables, measuring temperature, drawing conclusions.

**Key vocabulary:** neutralisation, acid, alkali, salt, water, pH 7, indicator, antacid, sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, exothermic

---

### Lesson 28 -- Energy changes: exothermic and endothermic reactions
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C089 (Energy in state changes), SC-KS3-C090 (Exothermic and endothermic)
**Type:** New content (practical)
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D008-CL007 (followed -- both energy concepts taught together)

Demonstrate exothermic reactions: combustion of magnesium (temperature rises), neutralisation (measured in Lesson 27), self-heating hand warmers. Demonstrate endothermic reactions: dissolve ammonium nitrate in water (temperature drops), citric acid + sodium hydrogencarbonate (temperature drops). Pupils measure temperature changes with thermometers or data loggers. Classify each reaction as exothermic or endothermic. Draw simple energy level diagrams. Connect to changes of state: melting and boiling are endothermic (energy absorbed to break intermolecular forces); freezing and condensation are exothermic. Use heating/cooling curve data to show temperature plateaux during state changes. Working Scientifically: collecting and presenting data, drawing graphs, identifying patterns.

**Key vocabulary:** exothermic, endothermic, energy change, temperature change, surroundings, energy level diagram, heating curve, latent heat, intermolecular force, activation energy

### Notes on what is not included

This 28-lesson plan does not include:
- A summative end-of-topic assessment for D008 (would be Lesson 29 in practice)
- Revision or consolidation lessons before assessment (these would be added in a real scheme)
- STEM enrichment or cross-curricular links (could be embedded but not planned as standalone lessons)
- Intervention or catch-up lessons for pupils who fall behind

In a real school year, I would build in 2-3 additional lessons for flexibility, bringing the total to approximately 30-31 lessons, or roughly 10-11 weeks of teaching at 3 lessons per week.
