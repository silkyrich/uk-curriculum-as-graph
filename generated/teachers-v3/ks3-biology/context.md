# Teaching Context (from Graph)


## Domain: SC-KS3-D002 — Biology - Structure and Function of Living Organisms
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS3 | **Age:** 11-14 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Structure and function of living organisms at KS3 introduces pupils to the cell as the fundamental unit of life, progressing from the macroscopic study of organisms in primary science to the microscopic level of cells, tissues and organs. Pupils learn the differences between plant, animal and bacterial cells, the function of key organelles, and how cells are specialised for different roles. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to understand organ systems — skeletal, muscular, digestive, respiratory and reproductive — and to understand gas exchange, nutrition and transport in a range of organisms. The concept of cells as the building blocks of life provides the organising framework for all of KS3 biology and is extended to genetics, evolution and ecology in subsequent domains.

### Concepts (25)

#### SC-KS3-C026 — Cell structure **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 9

Knowledge that cells are the fundamental unit of living organisms with specific structures

**Teaching guidance:** Begin with the concept that all living things are made of cells, then introduce plant and animal cell diagrams with labels. Use prepared slides under light microscopes to observe real cells — onion epidermal cells and cheek cells are excellent starting points. Compare microscope images with textbook diagrams to help pupils understand that real cells are less regular than illustrations. Use 3D models or animations to reinforce understanding of cell structure.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think cells are flat, 2D structures because they see flat diagrams — use 3D models to show cells are three-dimensional. Students may believe all cells look the same — show images of diverse cell types. Students sometimes think the cell membrane and cell wall are the same — clarify that the membrane controls what enters and leaves, while the cell wall provides structural support.

**Key vocabulary:** cell, nucleus, cytoplasm, cell membrane, cell wall, vacuole, chloroplast, mitochondria, organelle, plant cell, animal cell, prokaryote, eukaryote, unicellular, multicellular

#### SC-KS3-C027 — Light microscopy
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Skill in using a light microscope to observe and record cell structure

**Teaching guidance:** Teach microscopy as a practical skill sequence: carrying, setting up, focusing (start with lowest magnification), preparing slides, staining (iodine for starch in plant cells, methylene blue for animal cells), drawing scientific diagrams. Use a structured practical guide. Have pupils calculate magnification using the formula: magnification = image size ÷ actual size. Provide scale bars on diagrams and practise working between mm, µm, and nm.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often confuse magnification with resolution — magnification makes things look bigger, resolution determines how much detail you can see. Students may think a higher magnification always gives a better image — at very high magnification the image may be blurred if resolution is insufficient. Students sometimes close one eye when using the microscope — encourage keeping both eyes open.

**Key vocabulary:** light microscope, eyepiece, objective lens, stage, focusing knob, magnification, resolution, slide, cover slip, stain, iodine, methylene blue, field of view, scientific drawing, scale bar, micrometre

#### SC-KS3-C028 — Cell organelle functions
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 2

Knowledge of the functions of cell wall, membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, vacuole, mitochondria, and chloroplasts

**Teaching guidance:** Use annotated diagrams to teach the function of each organelle: nucleus (contains DNA, controls the cell), mitochondria (site of aerobic respiration), cell membrane (selectively permeable barrier), cytoplasm (where chemical reactions occur), chloroplasts (photosynthesis in plant cells), vacuole (stores cell sap in plant cells), ribosomes (protein synthesis). Create a function-matching card sort activity. Connect organelle function to whole-organism processes.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think the nucleus is the 'brain' that controls the cell in real time — clarify that the nucleus contains the genetic instructions (DNA) but does not actively direct processes moment by moment. Students also think all plant cells have chloroplasts — only cells exposed to light (leaf mesophyll, stem epidermis) contain chloroplasts, not root cells.

**Key vocabulary:** nucleus, cytoplasm, cell membrane, cell wall, mitochondria, chloroplast, ribosome, vacuole, organelle, DNA, selectively permeable, respiration, photosynthesis, protein synthesis, cell sap

#### SC-KS3-C029 — Plant vs animal cells
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding the similarities and differences between plant and animal cell structures

**Teaching guidance:** Use a Venn diagram to compare and contrast plant and animal cells. Create a table listing organelles present in each cell type. Key distinctions: plant cells have cell walls, large permanent vacuoles, and chloroplasts; animal cells do not. Both have a nucleus, cytoplasm, cell membrane, mitochondria, and ribosomes. Use microscope observation of both cell types side by side. Extend to bacteria as cells without a nucleus.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think plant cells have no mitochondria because they have chloroplasts — clarify that plant cells need mitochondria for respiration (which occurs all the time), while chloroplasts only function in the light. Students may also think animal cells have no vacuoles — animal cells can have small temporary vacuoles, but lack the large permanent vacuole of plant cells.

**Key vocabulary:** plant cell, animal cell, cell wall, cellulose, chloroplast, permanent vacuole, cell membrane, nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondria, ribosome, comparison, structural difference, functional difference

#### SC-KS3-C030 — Diffusion **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 3

Understanding diffusion as the movement of particles from high to low concentration

**Teaching guidance:** Demonstrate diffusion using potassium permanganate crystals in water or food colouring in agar jelly — pupils can observe the purple colour spreading from areas of high to low concentration. Use the particle model to explain diffusion: particles move randomly, and the net movement is from high to low concentration. Connect to biological examples: oxygen diffusing into blood in the lungs, carbon dioxide diffusing out. Discuss factors affecting rate of diffusion: temperature, concentration gradient, surface area.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think particles only move from high to low concentration — clarify that individual particles move randomly in all directions, but the net movement is from high to low concentration. Students may also think diffusion requires energy from the cell — diffusion is a passive process driven by the random motion of particles.

**Key vocabulary:** diffusion, concentration, concentration gradient, net movement, random motion, particle, equilibrium, high concentration, low concentration, surface area, temperature, membrane, passive transport

#### SC-KS3-C031 — Unicellular adaptations
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding how unicellular organisms are adapted to their environment

**Teaching guidance:** Study specific unicellular organisms: Amoeba (moves using pseudopodia, engulfs food), Euglena (has a flagellum and chloroplasts), Paramecium (moves using cilia, has an oral groove for feeding). Use microscope videos or live cultures where available. Compare how each organism carries out the seven life processes (movement, nutrition, reproduction, etc.) using a single cell. Discuss how unicellular organisms are adapted to survive without specialised organ systems.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think unicellular organisms are 'simple' and therefore less successful — point out that unicellular organisms are the most abundant life forms on Earth. Students may also confuse unicellular with 'primitive' — many unicellular organisms have complex internal structures and sophisticated adaptations.

**Key vocabulary:** unicellular, Amoeba, Euglena, Paramecium, yeast, flagellum, pseudopod, cilia, chloroplast, adaptation, binary fission, contractile vacuole, cell membrane, environment, microorganism

#### SC-KS3-C032 — Biological hierarchy **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 5

Understanding the organization from cells to tissues to organs to systems to organisms

**Teaching guidance:** Build the hierarchy from the bottom up: start with a cell, then group specialised cells into tissues, tissues into organs, organs into organ systems, and organ systems into the whole organism. Use the digestive system as a worked example: epithelial cells → epithelial tissue → stomach (organ) → digestive system → organism. Create a physical model or poster showing the hierarchy with real examples at each level. Connect to SC-KS3-C026 (cell structure).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often confuse organs and organ systems — an organ (e.g., the stomach) is a single structure made of multiple tissues; an organ system (e.g., the digestive system) is a group of organs working together. Students may also think that tissues are made of identical cells — tissues can contain more than one cell type working together.

**Key vocabulary:** cell, tissue, organ, organ system, organism, hierarchy, specialisation, epithelial, muscle tissue, connective tissue, nervous tissue, digestive system, circulatory system, organisation

#### SC-KS3-C033 — Skeletal structure and function
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 2

Knowledge of the human skeleton structure and its functions: support, protection, movement, blood cell production

**Teaching guidance:** Use a model skeleton or skeleton diagram to identify major bones: skull, ribs, vertebral column, pelvis, femur, tibia, humerus, radius, ulna. Discuss the four functions of the skeleton: support (holds the body upright), protection (skull protects the brain, ribs protect heart and lungs), movement (bones act as levers for muscles), and blood cell production (in bone marrow). Examine real or model joints to understand types of movement.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think bones are dead, solid structures — emphasise that bones are living tissue containing blood vessels, nerves, and bone marrow where blood cells are produced. Students may also think the skeleton's only function is support — draw attention to protection of organs and blood cell production as equally important functions.

**Key vocabulary:** skeleton, skull, rib, vertebra, pelvis, femur, tibia, humerus, joint, cartilage, ligament, tendon, bone marrow, support, protection, movement, lever

#### SC-KS3-C034 — Biomechanics
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding how skeleton and muscles interact to produce movement and force

**Teaching guidance:** Use a model arm or jointed skeleton to demonstrate how bones act as levers with muscles providing the force. Identify the pivot (joint), effort (muscle contraction), and load (weight being moved). Investigate how changing the position of the effort or load relative to the pivot affects the force needed. Connect to physics concepts of moments and levers (SC-KS3-C124). Use video analysis of sports movements to illustrate biomechanical principles.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think muscles push as well as pull — muscles can only contract (pull). Students may also think that bigger muscles always produce more movement — the length of the lever arm and position of the muscle attachment are equally important. Students sometimes confuse tendons (connect muscle to bone) with ligaments (connect bone to bone).

**Key vocabulary:** biomechanics, lever, pivot, fulcrum, effort, load, force, joint, hinge joint, ball-and-socket joint, mechanical advantage, extension, flexion, muscle attachment, tendon

#### SC-KS3-C035 — Antagonistic muscles
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding how pairs of muscles work in opposition to produce movement

**Teaching guidance:** Use the biceps-triceps pair as the main example of antagonistic muscles. When the biceps contracts, the triceps relaxes, and the arm bends (flexion). When the triceps contracts, the biceps relaxes, and the arm straightens (extension). Pupils can feel their own biceps and triceps during arm movements. Extend to other pairs: quadriceps-hamstrings in the leg. Use a model arm with elastic bands as muscles to demonstrate the principle. Connect to the skeletal system as the framework muscles act upon.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think muscles can push — muscles can only pull (contract). Antagonistic pairs are needed because one muscle cannot push a bone back to its original position. Students may also think that when a muscle relaxes it actively moves — the relaxed muscle is moved by the contraction of its antagonistic partner.

**Key vocabulary:** antagonistic muscles, biceps, triceps, contract, relax, flexion, extension, pair, quadriceps, hamstrings, muscle fibre, muscle tone, voluntary, involuntary, skeletal muscle

#### SC-KS3-C036 — Balanced diet components
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 2

Knowledge of nutrients required in a healthy human diet and why each is needed

**Teaching guidance:** Use food labels and nutritional databases to investigate the composition of real meals. Teach the seven nutrient groups: carbohydrates (energy), proteins (growth and repair), lipids/fats (energy store and insulation), vitamins (small quantities for health), minerals (e.g., iron for blood, calcium for bones), fibre (digestive health), and water. Have pupils plan a balanced meal for a specific person (child, athlete, pregnant woman) considering their needs. Connect to food tests (Benedict's for reducing sugars, iodine for starch, Biuret for protein, ethanol emulsion for fats).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think 'a balanced diet means eating equal amounts of everything' — clarify that a balanced diet means eating the right amounts of each nutrient for your needs. Students may also believe that all fats are unhealthy — explain that unsaturated fats are essential and important for health.

**Key vocabulary:** balanced diet, carbohydrate, protein, lipid, fat, vitamin, mineral, fibre, water, nutrient, energy, calorie, kilojoule, food group, malnutrition, deficiency

#### SC-KS3-C037 — Energy requirements calculation
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Ability to calculate energy requirements for a healthy daily diet

**Teaching guidance:** Use food labels to find energy values in kilojoules (kJ) per 100g. Have pupils calculate the energy content of a meal by adding the energy from each ingredient. Introduce the concept that energy requirements vary by age, sex, and activity level. Use published guidelines (e.g., an average adult needs approximately 8,400 kJ or 2,000 kcal per day) as a reference. Have pupils compare their calculated meal energy with recommended daily intakes. Connect to the calorimetry practical where available.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often confuse calories and kilocalories — what food labels call 'Calories' (capital C) are actually kilocalories. Students may also think that the only way to lose weight is to eat less — energy balance depends on both intake and expenditure through activity. Students sometimes believe that low-fat foods are always healthier — low-fat products may contain more sugar.

**Key vocabulary:** energy, kilojoule, kilocalorie, calorie, food label, daily intake, energy requirement, basal metabolic rate, physical activity, energy balance, calorimetry, combustion, recommended daily allowance

#### SC-KS3-C038 — Diet imbalances
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Understanding consequences of dietary imbalances including obesity, starvation, and deficiency diseases

**Teaching guidance:** Discuss the health consequences of too much, too little, or the wrong type of food. Cover obesity (energy intake exceeds expenditure, leading to type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease), starvation (insufficient energy, leading to muscle wasting), and specific deficiency diseases (scurvy from vitamin C deficiency, rickets from vitamin D or calcium deficiency, anaemia from iron deficiency). Use case studies and data analysis to explore the relationship between diet and health. Connect to socioeconomic factors affecting diet.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think malnutrition means 'not eating enough' — clarify that malnutrition means any imbalanced diet, including overeating or lacking specific nutrients. An obese person can be malnourished if their diet lacks essential vitamins and minerals. Students may also think deficiency diseases only occur in developing countries — vitamin D deficiency is common in the UK.

**Key vocabulary:** obesity, starvation, malnutrition, deficiency disease, scurvy, rickets, anaemia, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, body mass index, energy imbalance, vitamin deficiency, mineral deficiency, undernutrition, overnutrition

#### SC-KS3-C039 — Digestive system **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 3

Knowledge of the tissues, organs and functions of the human digestive system

**Teaching guidance:** Trace food through the digestive system organ by organ: mouth (mechanical digestion by teeth, chemical digestion by salivary amylase), oesophagus (peristalsis), stomach (acid and protease enzymes), small intestine (pancreatic enzymes, bile, absorption through villi), large intestine (water absorption), rectum and anus (egestion). Use a torso model to identify each organ. Distinguish between mechanical digestion (physical breakdown into smaller pieces) and chemical digestion (enzymes breaking bonds). Connect to SC-KS3-C040 (enzymes).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think digestion only happens in the stomach — clarify that chemical digestion begins in the mouth and continues in the small intestine. Students confuse absorption with digestion — digestion breaks food down, absorption moves nutrients into the blood. Students may also think the small intestine is shorter than the large intestine — 'small' refers to diameter, not length.

**Key vocabulary:** mouth, teeth, salivary gland, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, liver, pancreas, bile, peristalsis, mechanical digestion, chemical digestion, absorption, villi, egestion

#### SC-KS3-C040 — Enzymes as catalysts
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding that enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up digestion

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce enzymes as biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions without being used up. Use the lock-and-key model to explain enzyme specificity: each enzyme has a specific active site that fits a specific substrate. Demonstrate enzyme action using amylase breaking down starch (test with iodine solution) or catalase decomposing hydrogen peroxide. Investigate the effect of temperature on enzyme activity — connect to denaturation at high temperatures. Introduce the three main digestive enzymes: amylase (starch → sugars), protease (protein → amino acids), lipase (fats → fatty acids + glycerol).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often say enzymes are 'killed' by heat — enzymes are proteins that are 'denatured', meaning the active site changes shape irreversibly. Students may also think enzymes are living things — they are molecules (proteins). Students sometimes think each enzyme works on all substrates — emphasise that enzymes are specific to particular substrates.

**Key vocabulary:** enzyme, biological catalyst, active site, substrate, product, lock-and-key model, specificity, amylase, protease, lipase, denaturation, optimum temperature, rate of reaction, starch, protein, lipid

#### SC-KS3-C041 — Gut bacteria
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Understanding the important role of bacteria in the human digestive system

**Teaching guidance:** Discuss the role of gut bacteria in health: they help break down food that human enzymes cannot digest (particularly dietary fibre), synthesise vitamins (vitamin K, B vitamins), and protect against harmful pathogens by competing for resources. Introduce the concept of the gut microbiome as a community of trillions of microorganisms. Discuss factors that affect gut bacteria: diet (fibre promotes beneficial bacteria), antibiotics (can disrupt gut flora), and probiotics. Connect to the immune system and overall health.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think all bacteria are harmful — emphasise that the vast majority of bacteria in the gut are beneficial and essential for health. Students may also think bacteria only break down food — they also produce vitamins and protect against disease. Students sometimes confuse probiotics (live beneficial bacteria) with prebiotics (food for beneficial bacteria).

**Key vocabulary:** gut bacteria, microbiome, microorganism, flora, beneficial bacteria, fibre, fermentation, vitamin synthesis, pathogen, probiotic, prebiotic, symbiosis, mutualism, digestive health, antibiotic

#### SC-KS3-C042 — Plant nutrition
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding how plants obtain nutrients: photosynthesis in leaves, water and minerals from roots

**Teaching guidance:** Distinguish between the two ways plants obtain nutrients: (1) photosynthesis in leaves produces glucose using light energy, carbon dioxide and water; (2) roots absorb water and dissolved mineral ions from the soil. Explain that mineral ions (nitrates for protein, phosphates for DNA, magnesium for chlorophyll) are needed in small amounts. Use a practical with mineral-deficient solutions to show the effects of lacking specific minerals on plant growth. Connect to SC-KS3-C051 (photosynthesis).

**Common misconceptions:** Students commonly believe plants get their food from the soil — this is the most persistent misconception in biology. Clarify that plants make their own food (glucose) through photosynthesis; they only absorb water and mineral ions from the soil. Students may also think plants only photosynthesise during the day and only respire at night — plants respire continuously.

**Key vocabulary:** photosynthesis, mineral ion, nitrate, phosphate, magnesium, potassium, root hair cell, absorption, active transport, xylem, phloem, glucose, water, carbon dioxide, nutrient deficiency

#### SC-KS3-C043 — Gas exchange system structure
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Knowledge of the structure and adaptations of the human gas exchange system

**Teaching guidance:** Use a model or diagram of the human respiratory system to identify: nose, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, alveoli, diaphragm, and intercostal muscles. Focus on how alveoli are adapted for efficient gas exchange: large surface area, thin walls (one cell thick), rich blood supply, moist surface. Demonstrate the surface area concept by comparing a flat balloon with a scrunched piece of paper of the same area. Connect to diffusion (SC-KS3-C030) — oxygen diffuses into the blood and carbon dioxide diffuses out.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think we breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide only — expired air still contains approximately 16% oxygen. Students confuse breathing (ventilation — the mechanical process) with respiration (the chemical process in cells). Students may also think the lungs are hollow like balloons — the lungs contain millions of tiny alveoli providing a huge surface area.

**Key vocabulary:** gas exchange, trachea, bronchus, bronchiole, alveolus, alveoli, diaphragm, intercostal muscles, surface area, thin walls, capillary, diffusion, oxygen, carbon dioxide, mucus, cilia

#### SC-KS3-C044 — Breathing mechanism
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding the pressure model of breathing and lung volume measurement

**Teaching guidance:** Demonstrate the bell jar model of breathing: a bell jar represents the thorax, balloons represent the lungs, and a rubber sheet represents the diaphragm. When the diaphragm is pulled down, the volume inside increases, pressure decreases, and air rushes in. Have pupils use peak flow meters or spirometers to measure their lung volumes and compare. Discuss how exercise increases breathing rate and depth. Connect to the physics of pressure (SC-KS3-C130).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think the lungs actively expand like balloons — clarify that it is the diaphragm and intercostal muscles that cause the change in volume, and air enters passively due to the resulting pressure difference. Students may also think the diaphragm moves up when you breathe in — it contracts and flattens (moves down) during inhalation.

**Key vocabulary:** ventilation, inhalation, exhalation, diaphragm, intercostal muscles, ribcage, thorax, volume, pressure, tidal volume, vital capacity, peak flow, spirometer, breathing rate

#### SC-KS3-C045 — Impacts on gas exchange
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Understanding how exercise, asthma, and smoking affect the gas exchange system

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate the effect of exercise on breathing rate by measuring breaths per minute before and after exercise. Discuss how exercise increases oxygen demand and CO₂ production, leading to faster and deeper breathing. Explain asthma as narrowing of the airways (bronchioles constrict, excess mucus produced) and how inhalers (bronchodilators) work. Discuss the effects of smoking: tar damages cilia and causes mucus build-up, carbon monoxide reduces oxygen-carrying capacity, chemicals cause lung cancer and COPD. Use data on smoking-related diseases for analysis.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think asthma is an allergy — while allergens can trigger asthma attacks, asthma is a chronic condition involving inflammation and narrowing of the airways. Students may also think that only heavy smokers get lung disease — passive smoking and even light smoking increase health risks significantly.

**Key vocabulary:** exercise, breathing rate, asthma, bronchodilator, inhaler, tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide, COPD, emphysema, lung cancer, cilia, mucus, allergen, airway

#### SC-KS3-C046 — Stomata function
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding the role of stomata in plant gas exchange

**Teaching guidance:** Use microscopy or images of leaf epidermal peels to observe stomata (singular: stoma). Explain that stomata are pores on the underside of leaves controlled by guard cells. When guard cells are turgid (full of water), stomata open to allow gas exchange (CO₂ in for photosynthesis, O₂ out). When guard cells lose water, stomata close to prevent water loss. Investigate stomatal density on different leaf surfaces using nail varnish peel technique. Connect to transpiration and water balance.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think stomata are only for photosynthesis — stomata also allow water loss through transpiration and release oxygen. Students may think stomata are always open — they close at night or when the plant is under water stress. Students sometimes confuse where most stomata are found — the majority are on the lower surface of leaves.

**Key vocabulary:** stoma, stomata, guard cell, gas exchange, transpiration, turgid, flaccid, carbon dioxide, oxygen, water vapour, epidermis, pore, photosynthesis, leaf surface, cuticle

#### SC-KS3-C047 — Human reproduction
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Knowledge of human reproductive system structure, function, menstrual cycle, fertilization, gestation, and birth

**Teaching guidance:** Teach the male and female reproductive systems using anatomical diagrams: testes produce sperm, ovaries release eggs (ova). Explain the menstrual cycle as a ~28-day cycle: menstruation, follicle development, ovulation, and the uterus lining thickening in preparation for pregnancy. Cover fertilisation (sperm fuses with egg in the oviduct), implantation, gestation (9 months), and fetal development. Discuss puberty and the hormonal changes that trigger reproductive maturity. Handle this topic sensitively, following school PSHE guidelines.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think fertilisation occurs in the uterus — clarify that fertilisation occurs in the oviduct (fallopian tube) and the fertilised egg then implants in the uterus. Students may also think menstruation means the woman is fertile at that time — ovulation (the fertile period) typically occurs around day 14, not during menstruation.

**Key vocabulary:** reproduction, fertilisation, gamete, sperm, ovum, testis, ovary, oviduct, uterus, menstrual cycle, ovulation, implantation, gestation, embryo, fetus, placenta, puberty, hormone, oestrogen, testosterone

#### SC-KS3-C048 — Placenta function
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding how maternal lifestyle affects the fetus through the placenta

**Teaching guidance:** Explain that the placenta is the organ that connects the developing fetus to the mother's blood supply. The placenta allows oxygen and nutrients to pass from mother to fetus, and carbon dioxide and waste to pass from fetus to mother, without the blood supplies mixing directly. Discuss how substances consumed by the mother can cross the placenta and affect the fetus: alcohol (fetal alcohol syndrome), smoking (low birth weight, premature birth), drugs, and pathogens (rubella virus). Use case study data to evaluate the impact of maternal lifestyle choices.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think the mother's blood flows directly to the baby — clarify that maternal and fetal blood do not mix; substances pass across the placental membrane by diffusion. Students may also think the placenta is a perfect filter that blocks all harmful substances — many drugs, alcohol, and pathogens can cross the placenta.

**Key vocabulary:** placenta, umbilical cord, fetus, embryo, oxygen, nutrient, carbon dioxide, waste, diffusion, maternal blood, fetal blood, alcohol, fetal alcohol syndrome, smoking, premature birth, low birth weight

#### SC-KS3-C049 — Plant reproduction
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Knowledge of flower structure, pollination, fertilization, and seed dispersal

**Teaching guidance:** Dissect a flower (lily or buttercup work well) to identify the reproductive structures: sepals, petals, stamens (anther + filament), and carpel (stigma + style + ovary). Teach pollination as the transfer of pollen from anther to stigma — distinguish between insect pollination (bright petals, scent, nectar, sticky pollen) and wind pollination (small petals, feathery stigma, light pollen). Cover fertilisation (pollen tube grows down style to ovule), seed formation, and fruit development. Investigate seed dispersal mechanisms: wind, animal, water, explosion.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often confuse pollination with fertilisation — pollination is the transfer of pollen to the stigma; fertilisation is the fusion of the male and female gametes inside the ovule. Students may also think all flowers are insect-pollinated because they are colourful — wind-pollinated flowers (grasses, many trees) are often small and dull.

**Key vocabulary:** flower, sepal, petal, stamen, anther, filament, carpel, stigma, style, ovary, ovule, pollen, pollination, insect pollination, wind pollination, fertilisation, pollen tube, seed, fruit, dispersal

#### SC-KS3-C050 — Drug effects
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Understanding the effects of recreational drugs on behavior, health, and life processes

**Teaching guidance:** Distinguish between medicinal drugs (developed through clinical trials, prescribed by doctors), legal recreational drugs (alcohol, caffeine, nicotine), and illegal recreational drugs (cannabis, ecstasy, cocaine, heroin). Discuss how drugs affect the body: stimulants speed up the nervous system (caffeine, cocaine), depressants slow it down (alcohol, heroin), hallucinogens alter perception (LSD). Cover the concepts of tolerance, dependence, and addiction. Use data on drug-related health statistics for analysis. Handle sensitively, following school drug education policy.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think all drugs are illegal — clarify that medicines, caffeine, and alcohol are all drugs. Students may believe that 'natural' drugs are safer than synthetic ones — the source does not determine safety. Students sometimes think addiction is just a lack of willpower — addiction involves physical changes in the brain's reward pathways.

**Key vocabulary:** drug, medicinal drug, recreational drug, stimulant, depressant, hallucinogen, addiction, dependence, tolerance, withdrawal, overdose, alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, side effect

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS3-D002-CL001:**
- **Evidence and Argument** (primary): What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: This cluster asks pupils to gather, record or communicate scientific findings — the core cognitive demand is evaluating what counts as valid evidence and how to present it clearly.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Scientific observations and enquiry serve to establish causal relationships; framing questions around 'what causes X' gives purpose to the observation work.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

**SC-KS3-D002-CL002:**
- **Cause and Effect** (primary): What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Fair testing and investigations are designed to isolate variables and establish causal relationships — the cognitive demand is reasoning from controlled evidence to causal claims.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Data from repeated investigations reveals patterns that allow pupils to generalise their findings beyond the specific test conditions.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**SC-KS3-D002-CL003:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Body parts, organs and systems are understood by connecting their physical structure to their biological function — why is the heart shaped as it is, and how does that shape enable pumping?
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Systems and System Models**: What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Bodily systems (circulatory, digestive, skeletal) are interacting systems; tracing inputs, outputs and feedback between them deepens the structural understanding.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'

**SC-KS3-D002-CL004:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Food chains, food webs and ecosystems are system models: pupils map components (producers, consumers, decomposers), trace energy flows, and predict what happens when one part changes.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Stability and Change**: What keeps this stable, what causes change, and how quickly does change happen?
  Why: Ecosystems maintain dynamic equilibria that can be disrupted by changes to one component — exploring what keeps the system stable and what destabilises it is an equally powerful framing.
  AI instruction: Use the STABILITY AND CHANGE lens: prompt pupils to identify what conditions keep a system in balance, what disrupts equilibrium, and how change can be gradual or sudden. Useful questions: 'What keeps this the same?', 'What would tip it into change?', 'Is the change reversible?', 'How fast is this changing, and why?'

**SC-KS3-D002-CL005:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

## Domain: SC-KS3-D003 — Biology - Material Cycles and Energy
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS3 | **Age:** 11-14 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Material cycles and energy at KS3 develops pupils' understanding of how matter and energy move through living systems and the physical environment. Pupils study photosynthesis and respiration as complementary chemical processes — the input and output of energy in biological systems — and understand the relationship between these processes in the carbon cycle. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to understand cellular respiration as the process by which organisms obtain energy from glucose, and to understand how materials cycle between organisms and their environments through feeding relationships and decomposition. This domain connects biological science to chemistry (chemical reactions) and physics (energy transfer), exemplifying the interconnected nature of scientific disciplines.

### Concepts (6)

#### SC-KS3-C051 — Photosynthesis equation **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 4

Knowledge of the reactants, products, and word equation for photosynthesis

**Teaching guidance:** Teach the word equation for photosynthesis: carbon dioxide + water → glucose + oxygen (requires light energy). Use aquatic plants (Elodea/pondweed) to observe oxygen production as bubbles and investigate the effect of light intensity on the rate of photosynthesis. The starch test (iodine on destarched leaves) demonstrates that leaves produce starch from glucose. Introduce the idea that photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose. Connect to the carbon cycle and food chains.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think photosynthesis is the plant equivalent of respiration — clarify that photosynthesis and respiration are different processes with different purposes (photosynthesis makes food, respiration releases energy). Students may also believe plants only photosynthesise — plants also respire continuously. Students sometimes think oxygen is a waste product that plants do not need — plants use oxygen for their own respiration.

**Key vocabulary:** photosynthesis, carbon dioxide, water, glucose, oxygen, light energy, chlorophyll, chloroplast, starch, iodine test, endothermic, reactant, product, word equation, Elodea

#### SC-KS3-C052 — Photosynthesis importance
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that photosynthesis is the basis of almost all life on Earth

**Teaching guidance:** Discuss why photosynthesis is fundamental to almost all life on Earth: it is the process by which light energy is captured and converted into chemical energy in glucose, which enters food chains as the energy source for all consumers. Without photosynthesis, there would be no food or oxygen for aerobic organisms. Explore the exceptions: chemosynthetic organisms at deep-sea vents that use chemical energy instead of light. Connect to food webs (SC-KS3-C058) and the carbon cycle (SC-KS3-C104).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think the oxygen we breathe comes mainly from trees — while trees contribute, the majority of Earth's oxygen is produced by marine phytoplankton. Students may also think photosynthesis only benefits plants — emphasise that photosynthesis provides the energy base for almost all ecosystems and produces the oxygen needed by aerobic organisms.

**Key vocabulary:** photosynthesis, producer, autotroph, food chain, food web, energy source, glucose, oxygen, consumer, heterotroph, chemosynthesis, ecosystem, primary producer, trophic level

#### SC-KS3-C053 — Leaf adaptations
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Knowledge of how leaves are adapted for photosynthesis

**Teaching guidance:** Study leaf anatomy to identify how leaves are adapted for maximum photosynthesis: broad and flat (large surface area for light absorption), thin (short diffusion distance for gases), transparent epidermis and cuticle (allows light through), palisade mesophyll cells packed with chloroplasts (near the top for maximum light), spongy mesophyll with air spaces (allows gas circulation), network of veins (xylem delivers water, phloem removes sugars), stomata on the underside (gas exchange with minimal water loss). Use cross-section diagrams and microscope images.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think the green colour of leaves is caused by the leaf reflecting all light — clarify that chlorophyll absorbs red and blue light and reflects green light. Students may think all parts of a leaf photosynthesise equally — the palisade layer near the top does the most photosynthesis because it receives the most light.

**Key vocabulary:** leaf, epidermis, cuticle, palisade mesophyll, spongy mesophyll, chloroplast, stomata, guard cell, vein, xylem, phloem, surface area, adaptation, cross-section, transpiration

#### SC-KS3-C054 — Aerobic respiration **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 4 | Fan-out: 4

Understanding aerobic respiration as the breakdown of organic molecules using oxygen

**Teaching guidance:** Teach the word equation for aerobic respiration: glucose + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water (+ energy released). Emphasise that respiration occurs in all living cells, all the time — it is not the same as breathing. Demonstrate that organisms produce CO₂ using limewater with germinating seeds or small invertebrates in sealed containers. Connect to mitochondria as the site of aerobic respiration. Discuss where the energy released is used: movement, growth, maintaining body temperature, active transport.

**Common misconceptions:** Students commonly confuse respiration with breathing — respiration is the chemical process that releases energy from glucose in cells, while breathing is the mechanical process of ventilating the lungs. Students may think only animals respire — all living organisms (including plants, fungi, and bacteria) respire continuously. Students also sometimes think respiration only occurs during exercise.

**Key vocabulary:** aerobic respiration, glucose, oxygen, carbon dioxide, water, energy, mitochondria, exothermic, continuous, metabolic reaction, ATP, cell, organism, word equation

#### SC-KS3-C055 — Anaerobic respiration
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding anaerobic respiration including fermentation

**Teaching guidance:** Teach anaerobic respiration as respiration without oxygen. In animals: glucose → lactic acid (+ some energy). In yeast: glucose → ethanol + carbon dioxide (+ some energy). This is fermentation. Demonstrate fermentation using yeast, sugar, and warm water — collect CO₂ gas using a gas syringe or water displacement. Discuss real-world applications: bread making (CO₂ makes dough rise), brewing and wine making (ethanol produced), bioethanol production. Explain that anaerobic respiration releases much less energy than aerobic because glucose is not fully broken down.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think anaerobic respiration does not produce any energy — it does produce energy, just much less than aerobic respiration because glucose is only partially broken down. Students may confuse anaerobic respiration in animals (produces lactic acid) with fermentation in yeast (produces ethanol and CO₂). Students also sometimes think anaerobic respiration is a different process from respiration — it is the same process but without oxygen.

**Key vocabulary:** anaerobic respiration, fermentation, lactic acid, ethanol, carbon dioxide, oxygen debt, glucose, yeast, incomplete breakdown, energy, muscle fatigue, brewing, bread making, bioethanol

#### SC-KS3-C056 — Comparing respiration types
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding the differences between aerobic and anaerobic respiration

**Teaching guidance:** Create a comparison table for aerobic and anaerobic respiration covering: reactants, products, energy yield, where it occurs, and when it is used. Use exercise as the context: during moderate exercise, aerobic respiration provides enough energy; during intense exercise, muscles switch to anaerobic respiration when oxygen supply is insufficient, producing lactic acid that causes muscle fatigue. Discuss the oxygen debt — the extra oxygen needed after exercise to break down the accumulated lactic acid. Connect to sports science and endurance vs sprint training.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think aerobic and anaerobic respiration are completely separate processes — in reality, both can occur simultaneously in the same organism, with the balance depending on oxygen availability. Students may also think you either respire aerobically or anaerobically — during intense exercise, muscles use both pathways. Students sometimes believe that lactic acid is always harmful — it is a normal metabolic product that is broken down during recovery.

**Key vocabulary:** aerobic, anaerobic, comparison, oxygen, glucose, carbon dioxide, water, lactic acid, ethanol, energy yield, muscle fatigue, oxygen debt, exercise, endurance, sprint, recovery

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS3-D003-CL001:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Food chains, food webs and ecosystems are system models: pupils map components (producers, consumers, decomposers), trace energy flows, and predict what happens when one part changes.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Stability and Change**: What keeps this stable, what causes change, and how quickly does change happen?
  Why: Ecosystems maintain dynamic equilibria that can be disrupted by changes to one component — exploring what keeps the system stable and what destabilises it is an equally powerful framing.
  AI instruction: Use the STABILITY AND CHANGE lens: prompt pupils to identify what conditions keep a system in balance, what disrupts equilibrium, and how change can be gradual or sudden. Useful questions: 'What keeps this the same?', 'What would tip it into change?', 'Is the change reversible?', 'How fast is this changing, and why?'

**SC-KS3-D003-CL002:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Body parts, organs and systems are understood by connecting their physical structure to their biological function — why is the heart shaped as it is, and how does that shape enable pumping?
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Systems and System Models**: What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Bodily systems (circulatory, digestive, skeletal) are interacting systems; tracing inputs, outputs and feedback between them deepens the structural understanding.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'

Success criteria: Use quadrats to collect data on species distribution; Construct a food web from collected data; Explain the concept of interdependence with examples; Predict the effects of an environmental change on an ecosystem

## Domain: SC-KS3-D004 — Biology - Interactions and Interdependencies
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS3 | **Age:** 11-14 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Interactions and interdependencies covers the ecological relationships between organisms and their environments, from predator-prey dynamics to the human impact on ecosystems. Pupils learn to construct and interpret food webs, understand the role of producers, consumers and decomposers, and apply concepts of competition, adaptation and interdependence to explain the distribution of organisms. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to understand how changes to an ecosystem — including changes caused by human activity — can affect the organisms within it, with particular attention to the importance of biodiversity and the causes and consequences of extinction. Pupils are expected to interpret ecological data critically and to evaluate scientific evidence about environmental change.

### Concepts (4)

#### SC-KS3-C057 — Ecosystem interdependence **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 3

Understanding how organisms depend on each other in ecosystems

**Teaching guidance:** Use the example of a woodland or pond ecosystem to illustrate interdependence. Identify producers, primary consumers, secondary consumers, and decomposers. Discuss how organisms depend on each other: plants provide food and shelter for animals, animals pollinate plants and disperse seeds, decomposers recycle nutrients back to the soil. Use the 'Jenga tower' analogy — removing one species can destabilise the whole ecosystem. Investigate a local habitat to identify interdependent relationships.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think food chains are linear and isolated — in reality, organisms are part of complex food webs with multiple connections. Students may also think that removing one species only affects the species directly connected to it — the effects cascade through the entire ecosystem.

**Key vocabulary:** ecosystem, interdependence, community, population, habitat, producer, consumer, decomposer, food chain, food web, predator, prey, symbiosis, mutualism, parasitism, competition

#### SC-KS3-C058 — Food webs
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding food web relationships in ecosystems

**Teaching guidance:** Build food webs step by step: start with simple food chains, then show how they interconnect to form a web. Use organisms from a specific UK habitat (e.g., woodland: oak tree → caterpillar → blue tit → sparrowhawk). Have pupils construct food webs from species cards and predict what would happen if one species was removed. Introduce trophic levels: producer (T1), primary consumer (T2), secondary consumer (T3), tertiary consumer (T4). Discuss energy transfer between trophic levels — approximately 10% is passed on.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think the arrows in food chains show 'who eats who' — clarify that arrows show the direction of energy transfer (from organism being eaten to the organism eating it). Students also sometimes think top predators are the most important organisms — every level of the food web is essential.

**Key vocabulary:** food web, food chain, producer, primary consumer, secondary consumer, tertiary consumer, trophic level, predator, prey, herbivore, carnivore, omnivore, decomposer, energy transfer, arrow direction

#### SC-KS3-C059 — Pollination and food security
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding the importance of insect pollination for human food production

**Teaching guidance:** Use data on crop pollination to illustrate the economic importance of insect pollinators. Approximately 75% of globally important food crops benefit from animal pollination, including fruits (apples, strawberries), vegetables (tomatoes, courgettes), nuts (almonds), and oilseeds (rapeseed). Discuss the decline in pollinator populations (colony collapse disorder, habitat loss, pesticide use) and its implications for food security. Have pupils investigate which crops in their lunch are pollinator-dependent. Connect to biodiversity (SC-KS3-C067).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think only bees pollinate flowers — many insects (butterflies, moths, hoverflies, beetles) and even some birds and bats are pollinators. Students may also think wind-pollinated crops need insect pollinators — crops like wheat, rice, and corn are wind-pollinated and do not depend on insects.

**Key vocabulary:** pollination, pollinator, insect, bee, butterfly, food security, crop, agriculture, colony collapse, neonicotinoid, biodiversity, ecosystem service, cross-pollination, self-pollination, yield

#### SC-KS3-C060 — Environmental interactions
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding how organisms affect and are affected by their environment

**Teaching guidance:** Discuss how organisms both affect and are affected by their environment. Examples: earthworms improve soil structure (organisms affecting the environment), acid rain damages forests (environment affecting organisms), coral reefs create habitats for other species (organisms creating environments). Investigate how human activities affect ecosystems: deforestation, pollution, urbanisation, introduction of invasive species. Use data on environmental change to analyse impacts. Connect to adaptation and natural selection (SC-KS3-C065).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think organisms passively exist in their environment — emphasise that organisms actively modify their surroundings (e.g., beavers building dams, plants changing soil chemistry). Students may also think that only humans have a significant impact on the environment — all organisms interact with and change their environment.

**Key vocabulary:** environment, biotic factor, abiotic factor, adaptation, competition, predation, pollution, deforestation, urbanisation, invasive species, conservation, sustainability, biodiversity, ecosystem, human impact

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS3-D004-CL001:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Food chains, food webs and ecosystems are system models: pupils map components (producers, consumers, decomposers), trace energy flows, and predict what happens when one part changes.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Stability and Change**: What keeps this stable, what causes change, and how quickly does change happen?
  Why: Ecosystems maintain dynamic equilibria that can be disrupted by changes to one component — exploring what keeps the system stable and what destabilises it is an equally powerful framing.
  AI instruction: Use the STABILITY AND CHANGE lens: prompt pupils to identify what conditions keep a system in balance, what disrupts equilibrium, and how change can be gradual or sudden. Useful questions: 'What keeps this the same?', 'What would tip it into change?', 'Is the change reversible?', 'How fast is this changing, and why?'

**SC-KS3-D004-CL002:**
- **Cause and Effect** (primary): What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Fair testing and investigations are designed to isolate variables and establish causal relationships — the cognitive demand is reasoning from controlled evidence to causal claims.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Data from repeated investigations reveals patterns that allow pupils to generalise their findings beyond the specific test conditions.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**SC-KS3-D004-CL003:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?

#### SC-KS3-CV005 — Particle Model and Changes of State (investigation)
Investigation into the particle model — observing and measuring changes of state, plotting heating/cooling curves, and explaining observations using particle theory.
Delivers: SC-KS3-C058, SC-KS3-C059, SC-KS3-C060, SC-KS3-C061
Enquiry type: observation
Equipment: thermometers, beakers, ice, Bunsen burner or water bath, stearic acid (for cooling curve), stopwatch, heatproof mat
Expected outcome: Temperature stays constant during changes of state (melting, boiling). Particles in solids vibrate in fixed positions; in liquids they move freely; in gases they move rapidly in all directions. Energy is needed to change state.
Key vocabulary: particle, solid, liquid, gas, melting point, boiling point, evaporation, condensation, sublimation, energy
Assessment: Can pupils draw particle diagrams for all three states? Can they interpret a heating/cooling curve and explain the flat sections? Can they explain changes of state in terms of energy and particle movement?
Success criteria: Draw accurate particle diagrams for solids, liquids, and gases; Plot and interpret a heating or cooling curve; Explain why temperature remains constant during changes of state; Use particle theory to explain properties of solids, liquids, and gases

## Domain: SC-KS3-D005 — Biology - Genetics and Evolution
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS3 | **Age:** 11-14 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Genetics and evolution at KS3 provides pupils with an understanding of heredity, variation and natural selection — the theoretical framework that unifies all of biology. Pupils learn how genetic information is stored in DNA and passed from parents to offspring through reproduction, and how mutations and sexual reproduction create the genetic variation upon which natural selection acts. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to understand Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, to use evidence from the fossil record and comparative anatomy to support evolutionary theory, and to understand how selective breeding and genetic modification extend these principles. This domain builds directly on the Evolution and Inheritance topic introduced at upper KS2 and provides the foundation for detailed genetics study at GCSE.

### Concepts (7)

#### SC-KS3-C061 — Heredity **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 3

Understanding that genetic information is transmitted from one generation to the next

**Teaching guidance:** Use family pedigree diagrams to introduce the concept that characteristics are passed from parents to offspring. Distinguish between inherited characteristics (eye colour, blood group) and environmental characteristics (scars, language spoken). Discuss how sexual reproduction produces offspring with a mix of both parents' characteristics. Use simple Punnett squares with a single gene to show how genetic information is inherited. Connect to DNA (SC-KS3-C062) and variation (SC-KS3-C064).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think offspring are an exact 50-50 blend of both parents — clarify that inheritance is particulate (individual genes are passed on intact) not blending. Students may also think all characteristics are inherited — scars, learned skills, and language are acquired from the environment and are not passed on genetically.

**Key vocabulary:** heredity, inheritance, gene, allele, chromosome, offspring, parent, characteristic, trait, dominant, recessive, genotype, phenotype, Punnett square, generation

#### SC-KS3-C062 — DNA model **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 4

Understanding a simple model of chromosomes, genes, and DNA in heredity

**Teaching guidance:** Build a model of DNA structure using sweets, beads, or card to show the double helix. Explain the hierarchy: DNA is packaged into chromosomes, which are found in the nucleus. A gene is a section of DNA that codes for a specific protein. Human cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes (46 total). Use analogies: DNA is like a recipe book, chromosomes are chapters, and genes are individual recipes. Show images of chromosomes from karyotypes. Connect to heredity (SC-KS3-C061) and variation (SC-KS3-C064).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often confuse genes, chromosomes, and DNA — clarify the hierarchy: DNA is the molecule, a gene is a section of DNA, and a chromosome is a long strand of DNA coiled up. Students may think each chromosome contains one gene — each chromosome contains hundreds or thousands of genes.

**Key vocabulary:** DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid, chromosome, gene, nucleus, double helix, base pair, adenine, thymine, cytosine, guanine, protein, genetic code, genome, karyotype

#### SC-KS3-C063 — DNA discovery history
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Knowledge of Watson, Crick, Wilkins, and Franklin's role in developing the DNA model

**Teaching guidance:** Tell the story of the discovery of DNA structure as a case study in scientific collaboration and competition. James Watson and Francis Crick built the model, but relied on Maurice Wilkins' X-ray crystallography data and crucially on Rosalind Franklin's Photo 51, which provided key evidence for the helical structure. Discuss the ethical questions: Franklin's data was shared without her knowledge, and she did not receive the Nobel Prize (she died before it was awarded). Use this as an example of how science is a collaborative, and sometimes contentious, human endeavour.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think Watson and Crick discovered DNA — clarify that DNA was known since the 1860s (Miescher); Watson and Crick determined its structure in 1953. Students may believe scientific discoveries are made by lone geniuses — the DNA story shows that science is collaborative, building on the work of many researchers.

**Key vocabulary:** Watson, Crick, Wilkins, Franklin, Photo 51, X-ray crystallography, double helix, DNA structure, Nobel Prize, model building, evidence, collaboration, scientific discovery, credit, ethics

#### SC-KS3-C064 — Variation types **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 3

Understanding continuous and discontinuous variation within species

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate variation within the class by measuring continuous variables (hand span, height, foot length) and recording discontinuous variables (blood group, attached/free earlobes, tongue rolling). Plot continuous data as histograms showing a normal distribution, and discontinuous data as bar charts. Explain the causes of variation: genetic (mutations, sexual reproduction mixing alleles), environmental (diet, exercise, climate), or a combination of both. Height is a good example of both: genes set a range, environment determines where you fall within that range.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think variation is only genetic — clarify that environmental factors (nutrition, exercise, sunlight) also cause variation. Students may think continuous and discontinuous variation are determined by different mechanisms — both can have genetic causes, but continuous variation is usually influenced by multiple genes and the environment.

**Key vocabulary:** variation, continuous variation, discontinuous variation, genetic variation, environmental variation, mutation, allele, sexual reproduction, normal distribution, histogram, bar chart, inherited, acquired, species

#### SC-KS3-C065 — Natural selection **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5 | Fan-out: 3

Understanding how variation drives natural selection through competition

**Teaching guidance:** Use a simulation activity (e.g., 'bird beak' activity with different tools representing beak shapes competing for different food types) to demonstrate natural selection in action. Teach the four steps: (1) variation exists within a population, (2) there is competition for resources, (3) those with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, (4) advantageous traits are passed to the next generation. Use examples: antibiotic-resistant bacteria, peppered moth colour change during the industrial revolution, Darwin's finches. Connect to adaptation, variation, and inheritance.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think organisms change during their lifetime to adapt to their environment (Lamarckian evolution) — clarify that natural selection acts on existing variation in a population; individuals do not 'choose' to adapt. Students also think 'survival of the fittest' means the strongest — 'fittest' means best adapted to the environment. Students may think evolution has a goal or direction — evolution has no purpose; it is the result of random variation and non-random selection.

**Key vocabulary:** natural selection, survival of the fittest, adaptation, competition, variation, mutation, evolution, selective advantage, population, generation, inheritance, fitness, Charles Darwin, selection pressure, reproductive success

#### SC-KS3-C066 — Adaptation and extinction
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding how environmental changes can lead to extinction

**Teaching guidance:** Use case studies of extinct species (dodo, woolly mammoth, dinosaurs) and currently endangered species (polar bear, mountain gorilla, tiger) to explore the causes of extinction: habitat destruction, climate change, introduction of new predators/diseases, overexploitation. Discuss how rapid environmental changes can outpace the rate of adaptation. Use fossil evidence to show how species have changed over geological time. Connect to biodiversity (SC-KS3-C067) and natural selection (SC-KS3-C065). Have pupils evaluate conservation strategies.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think extinction only happened in the past (e.g., dinosaurs) — emphasise that species are going extinct today at an accelerating rate. Students may think any species can adapt to any change given enough time — if environmental change is too rapid or extreme, species may not have sufficient genetic variation to adapt.

**Key vocabulary:** adaptation, extinction, endangered, habitat loss, climate change, fossil, evolution, species, population, biodiversity, conservation, selective pressure, environmental change, vulnerability, resilience

#### SC-KS3-C067 — Biodiversity
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding the importance of maintaining biodiversity and gene banks

**Teaching guidance:** Define biodiversity as the variety of different species within an ecosystem (species diversity), the genetic variation within a species (genetic diversity), and the variety of ecosystems in an area (ecosystem diversity). Discuss why biodiversity matters: ecosystem stability, food security, medicine (many drugs derived from natural organisms), aesthetic and ethical value. Introduce gene banks, seed banks (e.g., Svalbard Global Seed Vault), and captive breeding programmes as conservation strategies. Have pupils evaluate the effectiveness of different conservation approaches using real data.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think biodiversity only means having lots of different species — clarify that genetic diversity within a species is equally important (a population with low genetic diversity is vulnerable to disease). Students may believe that zoos and seed banks alone can solve the biodiversity crisis — in-situ conservation (protecting habitats) is generally more effective than ex-situ approaches.

**Key vocabulary:** biodiversity, species diversity, genetic diversity, ecosystem diversity, gene bank, seed bank, conservation, captive breeding, habitat, endangered species, extinction, sustainability, ecosystem services, resilience

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS3-D005-CL001:**
- **Evidence and Argument** (primary): What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: This cluster asks pupils to gather, record or communicate scientific findings — the core cognitive demand is evaluating what counts as valid evidence and how to present it clearly.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Scientific observations and enquiry serve to establish causal relationships; framing questions around 'what causes X' gives purpose to the observation work.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

**SC-KS3-D005-CL002:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Sorting, classifying and identifying similarities directly trains pupils to recognise regularities and use them to predict or generalise.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Evidence and Argument**: What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Drawing conclusions from observations requires constructing a claim supported by specific evidence — not just describing what was seen.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'

**SC-KS3-D005-CL003:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Food chains, food webs and ecosystems are system models: pupils map components (producers, consumers, decomposers), trace energy flows, and predict what happens when one part changes.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Stability and Change**: What keeps this stable, what causes change, and how quickly does change happen?
  Why: Ecosystems maintain dynamic equilibria that can be disrupted by changes to one component — exploring what keeps the system stable and what destabilises it is an equally powerful framing.
  AI instruction: Use the STABILITY AND CHANGE lens: prompt pupils to identify what conditions keep a system in balance, what disrupts equilibrium, and how change can be gradual or sudden. Useful questions: 'What keeps this the same?', 'What would tip it into change?', 'Is the change reversible?', 'How fast is this changing, and why?'

**SC-KS3-D005-CL004:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Classification, variation and inheritance are fundamentally about recognising patterns in nature — pupils identify regularities that allow grouping and predict how traits are passed on.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Evolution and natural selection are causal processes: certain traits cause survival advantages, which causes differential reproduction — tracing this causal chain is the core cognitive demand.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

## Domain: SC-KS3-D006 — Chemistry - The Particulate Nature of Matter
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS3 | **Age:** 11-14 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
The particulate nature of matter provides the theoretical framework for all physical science — the idea that all matter is made of particles whose behaviour explains the properties and changes of materials. Pupils develop the particle model of solids, liquids and gases, using it to explain observable properties, diffusion, gas pressure and changes of state. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to apply the particle model quantitatively, understanding density as mass per unit volume and using particle diagrams to explain why materials have different densities. This domain builds on the states of matter work introduced at KS2 and provides the conceptual foundation for understanding chemical bonding, thermodynamics and the behaviour of gases at GCSE.

### Concepts (4)

#### SC-KS3-C068 — Particle model of matter **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 4 | Fan-out: 7

Understanding that matter is made of particles with properties explained by their arrangement and motion

**Teaching guidance:** Use animations or physical models (marbles in a tray) to demonstrate how particle arrangement and movement explain the properties of solids, liquids, and gases. Key features: particles in solids are closely packed in a regular arrangement and vibrate in fixed positions; particles in liquids are closely packed but irregularly arranged and can move past each other; particles in gases are widely spaced, move randomly and rapidly. Use the particle model to explain observable properties: solids have a fixed shape, liquids flow, gases fill their container and can be compressed.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think particles themselves change — e.g., particles in a solid are hard, particles in a gas are soft. Clarify that the particles are the same; it is their arrangement, spacing, and movement that differ. Students may also think there is something between the particles (air or glue) — in a pure substance, there is nothing between the particles.

**Key vocabulary:** particle model, solid, liquid, gas, arrangement, vibration, movement, spacing, regular, irregular, flow, compress, expand, fixed shape, fixed volume, diffusion, kinetic energy

#### SC-KS3-C069 — States of matter
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding the properties of solid, liquid, and gas states in terms of particles

**Teaching guidance:** Use the particle model to explain why solids have a fixed shape and volume, liquids have a fixed volume but take the shape of their container, and gases have neither fixed shape nor fixed volume. Demonstrate with real substances — ice, water, and steam as the same substance in three states. Use particle diagrams to represent each state. Introduce density as a consequence of particle arrangement: solids are generally the densest (particles closely packed), gases the least dense (particles widely spread). Calculate density using ρ = m/V.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think gases have no mass — demonstrate that air has mass using a balance and inflated vs deflated balloon. Students may also think that ice is less dense than water because it is a solid — ice is an unusual exception where the solid is less dense than the liquid due to hydrogen bonding creating an open crystal structure.

**Key vocabulary:** state of matter, solid, liquid, gas, property, shape, volume, density, particle arrangement, compressibility, flow, viscosity, mass, volume, ρ = m/V

#### SC-KS3-C070 — Gas pressure
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding gas pressure in terms of particle collisions

**Teaching guidance:** Explain gas pressure using the particle model: gas particles move randomly and at high speed, colliding with the walls of their container — these collisions create pressure. More frequent or forceful collisions = higher pressure. Demonstrate with a bicycle pump (compressing gas increases pressure), a marshmallow in a vacuum bell jar (reducing pressure causes it to expand), or a collapsing can experiment (cooling reduces gas pressure inside). Connect to atmospheric pressure (SC-KS3-C130) and temperature (SC-KS3-C165).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think gas pressure is caused by particles pushing against each other — clarify that pressure is caused by particles colliding with the walls of the container. Students may also think that a vacuum sucks things in — actually, the surrounding atmospheric pressure pushes things towards areas of lower pressure.

**Key vocabulary:** gas pressure, particle, collision, wall, container, force, area, compression, expansion, atmosphere, atmospheric pressure, pascal, bar, kinetic energy, temperature, volume, Boyle's law

#### SC-KS3-C071 — Changes of state
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding phase changes in terms of the particle model

**Teaching guidance:** Demonstrate changes of state practically: melt ice (solid → liquid), boil water (liquid → gas), condense steam on a cold surface (gas → liquid), freeze water (liquid → solid). Explain using the particle model: heating gives particles more energy, increasing their movement until they overcome the forces holding them in place. Use heating curves (temperature vs time) to show that temperature remains constant during a change of state — all the energy goes into breaking or forming bonds between particles, not increasing kinetic energy. Name all six changes of state: melting, freezing, boiling/evaporating, condensing, sublimating, depositing.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think that bubbles in boiling water are air — they are water vapour (steam). Students may think evaporation and boiling are the same — evaporation occurs only at the surface and at any temperature, while boiling occurs throughout the liquid at a specific temperature. Students also sometimes think that when water boils, the particles themselves break apart — the particles remain intact; only the bonds between them are broken.

**Key vocabulary:** change of state, melting, freezing, boiling, evaporation, condensation, sublimation, deposition, melting point, boiling point, latent heat, heating curve, energy, particle, bond, kinetic energy

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS3-D006-CL001:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Material properties link physical structure (molecular arrangement, surface texture) to functional behaviour (waterproofing, strength, flexibility) — the key question is always 'why does this material behave this way?'
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Properties can be sorted and classified into patterns (metals conduct, insulators don't), allowing pupils to make predictions about unfamiliar materials.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**SC-KS3-C071** (Changes of state):
  - WS-KS3-005 (Presenting data using tables and graphs) [observation]

## Domain: SC-KS3-D007 — Chemistry - Atoms, Elements and Compounds
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS3 | **Age:** 11-14 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Atoms, elements and compounds at KS3 provides pupils with the conceptual foundations of chemistry — that elements are pure substances made of one type of atom, and that compounds are formed when atoms of different elements bond together. Pupils learn the symbols and properties of common elements, interpret the periodic table as a systematic arrangement of elements, and understand the distinction between mixtures and compounds. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to represent chemical substances using formulae and to describe chemical reactions using word equations, understanding reactants and products. The use of atomic and molecular models deepens pupils' conceptual understanding and provides the foundation for the quantitative chemistry studied at GCSE.

### Concepts (10)

#### SC-KS3-C023 — Chemical nomenclature
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding and using IUPAC chemical naming conventions

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce IUPAC naming by relating it to common names pupils already know (e.g., table salt = sodium chloride, rust = iron oxide). Teach systematic patterns: metal + non-metal compounds end in '-ide' (sodium chloride, magnesium oxide), compounds containing oxygen from acids end in '-ate' or '-ite' (copper sulfate, calcium carbonate). Use molecular model kits to connect names to structures. Practise naming from formulae and writing formulae from names.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often confuse the names of elements with those of compounds — for example, thinking 'chlorine' and 'chloride' are the same thing. Clarify that '-ide' indicates a compound, while the element name has no suffix. Students may also think chemical names are arbitrary — emphasise that systematic naming follows predictable rules.

**Key vocabulary:** IUPAC, nomenclature, chemical name, systematic name, suffix, -ide, -ate, -ite, prefix, formula, element, compound, ion, binary compound, trivial name

#### SC-KS3-C072 — Dalton atomic model **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 4

Understanding the simple Dalton model of atoms

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce Dalton's atomic model as the foundation of modern chemistry: all matter is made of tiny, indivisible atoms; atoms of the same element are identical; atoms of different elements have different masses and properties; atoms combine in fixed ratios to form compounds. Use historical context: Dalton published his atomic theory in 1808, building on earlier ideas from Democritus. Discuss how the model was later refined (Thomson, Rutherford, Bohr) but Dalton's core ideas remain useful at KS3 level. Use molecular model kits to represent atoms and molecules.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think atoms are the smallest possible things — clarify that atoms contain even smaller particles (protons, neutrons, electrons), but at KS3 level the Dalton model treats atoms as the basic building blocks. Students may also confuse atoms with cells — atoms are the building blocks of matter, cells are the building blocks of living organisms.

**Key vocabulary:** atom, Dalton, atomic theory, element, compound, indivisible, mass, particle, sphere, model, molecular model, matter, chemical reaction, ratio, conservation of mass

#### SC-KS3-C073 — Atoms, elements, compounds **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 9

Understanding the differences between atoms, elements, and compounds

**Teaching guidance:** Use molecular model kits or animations to clearly distinguish: an atom is the smallest particle of an element; an element is a substance made of only one type of atom; a compound is a substance made of two or more different types of atoms chemically bonded together; a molecule is two or more atoms bonded together. Provide sorting activities where pupils classify substances (copper, oxygen gas O₂, water H₂O, sodium chloride NaCl) into elements and compounds. Show that the properties of a compound are completely different from those of its component elements (e.g., sodium is reactive and chlorine is toxic, but sodium chloride is table salt).

**Common misconceptions:** Students frequently confuse mixtures and compounds — a compound has a fixed composition and can only be separated by chemical reaction, while a mixture can vary in composition and can be separated by physical methods. Students also often think a molecule must contain different types of atoms — O₂ is a molecule of an element. Students may think compounds are just elements mixed together — emphasise that a chemical bond forms.

**Key vocabulary:** atom, element, compound, molecule, chemical bond, substance, periodic table, formula, symbol, mixture, pure substance, properties, sodium chloride, iron, oxygen

#### SC-KS3-C074 — Chemical symbols
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Knowledge of chemical symbols and formulae for elements and compounds

**Teaching guidance:** Teach the symbols of common elements by linking to the periodic table: some are intuitive (O for oxygen, C for carbon), others use Latin names (Fe for iron/ferrum, Au for gold/aurum, Na for sodium/natrium). Introduce simple chemical formulae: H₂O (2 hydrogen atoms, 1 oxygen atom), CO₂ (1 carbon, 2 oxygen), NaCl (1 sodium, 1 chlorine). Practise reading formulae by counting atoms. Use molecular models to connect 3D structures to their formulae. Display a periodic table prominently and use it routinely.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often confuse the subscript number in a formula with the number of molecules — clarify that H₂O means 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom in one molecule, not 2 molecules of hydrogen. Students may also think the order of symbols in a formula does not matter — CO (carbon monoxide) is very different from OC, and the convention matters.

**Key vocabulary:** chemical symbol, formula, subscript, periodic table, element, compound, atom, molecule, H₂O, CO₂, NaCl, CaCO₃, notation, Latin, abbreviation

#### SC-KS3-C075 — Conservation of mass
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding that mass is conserved in changes of state and chemical reactions

**Teaching guidance:** Demonstrate conservation of mass practically: react baking soda and vinegar in a sealed container on a balance to show that the total mass does not change. Then repeat with an open container to show apparent mass loss (CO₂ gas escapes). This establishes that mass is conserved, but gases can be lost to the atmosphere. Apply to changes of state: weigh ice before and after melting to show mass is unchanged. Use particle diagrams to explain: atoms are rearranged in chemical reactions but no atoms are created or destroyed. Connect to balancing equations.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think mass is lost when substances burn — clarify that the products (often CO₂ and H₂O gas) escape into the atmosphere. If the reaction occurs in a sealed container, the mass stays the same. Students may also think that when a solid dissolves it disappears — the mass is still present in the solution.

**Key vocabulary:** conservation of mass, chemical reaction, reactant, product, atom, rearrangement, mass, balance, gas, sealed system, open system, Lavoisier, physical change, chemical change

#### SC-KS3-C076 — Pure substances
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding the concept of a pure substance in chemistry

**Teaching guidance:** Define a pure substance as one that consists of only one type of element or compound — it has a fixed melting point and boiling point. Compare with everyday language where 'pure' means 'clean' or 'natural'. Use melting point data to determine purity: a pure substance melts at a sharp, specific temperature, while an impure substance melts over a range. Demonstrate with testing the melting point of pure stearic acid versus a mixture. Connect to separation techniques (SC-KS3-C079) and identifying pure substances (SC-KS3-C080).

**Common misconceptions:** Students confuse the scientific meaning of 'pure' with the everyday meaning — in everyday language, 'pure orange juice' means no additives, but it is still a mixture in scientific terms. In chemistry, 'pure' means a single substance with a fixed melting and boiling point. Students may also think that clear liquids are always pure — a clear solution can contain dissolved substances.

**Key vocabulary:** pure substance, impure substance, element, compound, melting point, boiling point, fixed point, sharp, range, purity, impurity, scientific definition, everyday definition, criterion

#### SC-KS3-C077 — Mixtures
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding mixtures and dissolving processes

**Teaching guidance:** Distinguish between mixtures (two or more substances not chemically combined, properties of each component retained, variable composition) and pure substances (fixed composition, properties differ from components). Use everyday examples: air is a mixture of gases, seawater is a mixture of water and dissolved salts, alloys are mixtures of metals. Demonstrate dissolving: add salt to water and discuss what happens at the particle level (salt particles disperse among water particles). Introduce solute, solvent, solution, and saturated solution. Connect to separation techniques (SC-KS3-C079).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think that when a substance dissolves it disappears — clarify that the particles are still present, just too small to see, and the mass is conserved. Students may also confuse dissolving with melting — dissolving involves a solute in a solvent, melting is a change of state caused by heating. Students sometimes think all mixtures are liquids — air and alloys are also mixtures.

**Key vocabulary:** mixture, dissolving, solute, solvent, solution, saturated, solubility, soluble, insoluble, suspension, alloy, composition, physical combination, properties, separate

#### SC-KS3-C078 — Diffusion in chemistry
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding diffusion in terms of the particle model

**Teaching guidance:** Link diffusion to the particle model: in gases and liquids, particles move randomly. When there is a concentration difference, the net movement is from high to low concentration. Demonstrate with bromine gas spreading in a gas jar (teacher demonstration), or potassium permanganate in water. Compare rates of diffusion in gases vs liquids — diffusion is faster in gases because particles move faster and are more widely spaced. Quantify using simple calculations of rate of diffusion. Connect to biological diffusion (SC-KS3-C030) and gas pressure (SC-KS3-C070).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think diffusion only occurs in liquids — diffusion occurs in both liquids and gases (and even very slowly in solids at high temperatures). Students may think particles are 'pushed' from high to low concentration — diffusion results from the random movement of individual particles; the net effect is movement down the gradient.

**Key vocabulary:** diffusion, particle, concentration, concentration gradient, random motion, net movement, gas, liquid, rate of diffusion, bromine, potassium permanganate, kinetic energy, temperature, molecular mass

#### SC-KS3-C079 — Separation techniques
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Skill in using filtration, evaporation, distillation, and chromatography to separate mixtures

**Teaching guidance:** Teach each separation technique with a practical demonstration: filtration (separating sand from salt water), evaporation (recovering salt from salt water), distillation (separating ink from water or separating a mixture of liquids), chromatography (separating food dyes or ink colours). For each technique, explain the physical principle: filtration uses particle size, evaporation uses different boiling points, distillation uses boiling point differences to collect vapour, chromatography uses different attractions to the stationary and mobile phases. Connect to the properties of mixtures and pure substances.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often confuse filtration and evaporation — filtration separates an insoluble solid from a liquid; evaporation separates a dissolved solid from a liquid. Students may think chromatography only works with inks — it can separate any mixture of dissolved substances. Students also sometimes think distillation creates pure substances from nothing — it separates substances already present in the mixture.

**Key vocabulary:** filtration, evaporation, distillation, chromatography, separation, mixture, filter paper, residue, filtrate, condensation, Liebig condenser, stationary phase, mobile phase, Rf value, solvent front

#### SC-KS3-C080 — Identifying pure substances
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Ability to identify pure substances using appropriate techniques

**Teaching guidance:** Teach that pure substances have fixed, sharp melting and boiling points, while mixtures melt and boil over a range of temperatures. Have pupils determine the boiling point of water (pure) versus salt water (impure) to see the difference. Use chromatography to test purity: a pure substance produces a single spot, while a mixture produces multiple spots. Discuss how these methods are used industrially and forensically. Connect to pure substances (SC-KS3-C076) and separation techniques (SC-KS3-C079).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think measuring melting point is difficult or imprecise — with proper technique and thermometers, melting points can be measured accurately and are a reliable test of purity. Students may think that if a substance looks pure (clear, colourless) it must be pure — dissolved impurities are invisible to the eye.

**Key vocabulary:** pure substance, impure substance, melting point, boiling point, chromatography, Rf value, sharp melting point, range, identification, forensic science, quality control, standard, reference, test

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS3-D007-CL001:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Material properties link physical structure (molecular arrangement, surface texture) to functional behaviour (waterproofing, strength, flexibility) — the key question is always 'why does this material behave this way?'
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Properties can be sorted and classified into patterns (metals conduct, insulators don't), allowing pupils to make predictions about unfamiliar materials.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**SC-KS3-D007-CL002:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Chemistry at KS4 is rich in patterns — periodic table trends, reactivity series, reaction type categories — that allow pupils to predict the behaviour of unfamiliar substances.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Chemical reactions involve causal mechanisms (electron transfer causes bonding, acid-base reactions follow proton transfer) that explain observed phenomena rather than merely describing them.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

**SC-KS3-D007-CL003:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Sorting, classifying and identifying similarities directly trains pupils to recognise regularities and use them to predict or generalise.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Evidence and Argument**: What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Drawing conclusions from observations requires constructing a claim supported by specific evidence — not just describing what was seen.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'

**SC-KS3-D007-CL004:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Chemistry at KS4 is rich in patterns — periodic table trends, reactivity series, reaction type categories — that allow pupils to predict the behaviour of unfamiliar substances.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Chemical reactions involve causal mechanisms (electron transfer causes bonding, acid-base reactions follow proton transfer) that explain observed phenomena rather than merely describing them.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes.

## Domain: SC-KS3-D008 — Chemistry - Chemical Reactions
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS3 | **Age:** 11-14 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Chemical reactions at KS3 develops pupils' understanding of what happens when substances react chemically — that new substances are formed, that the reaction can be detected by observable changes, and that energy is often transferred in the process. Pupils systematically study key reaction types including combustion, thermal decomposition, acid reactions with metals and bases, and oxidation/reduction, learning to predict products and observe the signs of reaction. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to understand the law of conservation of mass as applied to chemical reactions, and to recognise the difference between exothermic and endothermic energy changes. Pupils also develop practical skills in carrying out reactions safely, measuring yields and using chromatography as an analytical technique.

### Concepts (10)

#### SC-KS3-C081 — Reactions as atom rearrangement
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding that chemical reactions rearrange atoms without creating or destroying them

**Teaching guidance:** Use molecular models to demonstrate that in a chemical reaction, bonds between atoms in the reactants are broken and new bonds are formed to make the products. The atoms are rearranged, but no atoms are created or destroyed — this is why mass is conserved. Show animations of reactions at the molecular level. Compare with physical changes where no new substances are formed. Use examples: burning magnesium (Mg + O₂ → MgO), decomposing hydrogen peroxide (2H₂O₂ → 2H₂O + O₂). Connect to conservation of mass (SC-KS3-C075) and chemical equations (SC-KS3-C082).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think atoms are broken apart or destroyed in chemical reactions — emphasise that atoms are rearranged, not destroyed. Students may confuse chemical reactions with physical changes — in a chemical reaction, new substances with new properties are formed; in a physical change, no new substances are formed.

**Key vocabulary:** chemical reaction, atom, bond breaking, bond forming, rearrangement, reactant, product, conservation of mass, new substance, chemical change, physical change, reversible, irreversible

#### SC-KS3-C082 — Chemical equations **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: skill | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 4 | Fan-out: 3

Ability to represent chemical reactions using formulae and equations

**Teaching guidance:** Start with word equations: methane + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water. Then introduce symbol equations: CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O. Teach balancing by counting atoms on each side — the number of each type of atom must be equal on both sides (conservation of mass). Use a systematic approach: list atoms, count each side, adjust coefficients (never subscripts). Provide extensive practice with progressively harder equations. Use molecular models alongside written equations to reinforce the physical meaning of the symbols.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often change subscripts instead of coefficients when balancing equations — emphasise that changing the subscript changes the substance, while changing the coefficient changes the amount. Students may also think the arrow in an equation means 'equals' — it means 'reacts to form' or 'produces'. Students sometimes forget that diatomic elements (H₂, O₂, N₂, Cl₂) must be written as molecules.

**Key vocabulary:** word equation, symbol equation, reactant, product, arrow, coefficient, subscript, balanced equation, conservation of mass, formula, state symbol, (s), (l), (g), (aq)

#### SC-KS3-C083 — Types of reactions **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 3

Knowledge of combustion, thermal decomposition, oxidation, and displacement reactions

**Teaching guidance:** Teach key reaction types through practical demonstrations: combustion (burning magnesium ribbon in air, burning hydrocarbons), thermal decomposition (heating copper carbonate produces copper oxide + CO₂), oxidation (iron rusting over time, burning metals in oxygen), displacement (zinc displacing copper from copper sulfate solution — observe colour change). For each type, write word equations and identify the pattern. Create a comparison table of reaction types with examples, reactants, products, and signs of reaction. Connect to energy changes (SC-KS3-C090).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think combustion always produces flames — slow combustion (rusting) has no flame. Students may confuse thermal decomposition with burning — thermal decomposition is the breakdown of one substance by heat alone, with no oxygen required. Students sometimes think displacement reactions only work with metals — non-metals can also be displaced (e.g., halogens).

**Key vocabulary:** combustion, thermal decomposition, oxidation, reduction, displacement, reaction type, fuel, oxygen, carbon dioxide, water, oxide, word equation, exothermic, catalyst, decomposition

#### SC-KS3-C084 — Acids and alkalis **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 3

Understanding acids and alkalis in terms of neutralization reactions

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce acids (pH < 7) and alkalis (pH > 7) using common examples: acids include vinegar (ethanoic acid), lemon juice (citric acid), stomach acid (hydrochloric acid); alkalis include soap, oven cleaner (sodium hydroxide), baking soda solution (sodium hydrogencarbonate). Demonstrate neutralisation: add an acid to an alkali with universal indicator to show the pH changing towards 7. The general equation is: acid + alkali → salt + water. Use this as the basis for understanding all acid reactions. Connect to the pH scale (SC-KS3-C085).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think all acids are dangerous and corrosive — many acids are weak and safe (citric acid in lemons, ethanoic acid in vinegar). Students may confuse 'strong' with 'concentrated' — a strong acid fully dissociates in water, a concentrated acid has a high amount of acid per unit volume. Students also sometimes think neutralisation always produces water that is safe to drink — the salt produced may be harmful.

**Key vocabulary:** acid, alkali, base, neutral, neutralisation, pH, hydrogen ion, hydroxide ion, salt, water, reaction, indicator, universal indicator, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide, corrosive

#### SC-KS3-C085 — pH scale
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Understanding the pH scale and indicators for measuring acidity and alkalinity

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce the pH scale as running from 0 (most acidic) to 14 (most alkaline), with 7 being neutral. Demonstrate using universal indicator paper and solution with a range of household substances (lemon juice, water, milk, soap, bleach). Show how colour changes correspond to pH values. Introduce litmus paper as a simple acid/alkali indicator (red in acid, blue in alkali). Discuss the limitations of indicators versus pH meters for precise measurement. Connect to neutralisation (SC-KS3-C087) and acid reactions (SC-KS3-C086).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think pH 0 means 'no acid' — actually pH 0 is extremely acidic. Students may think the pH scale stops at 0 and 14 — while the standard scale runs 0-14, values outside this range are possible. Students sometimes believe that neutral (pH 7) means 'no chemicals' — pure water is neutral but is still a chemical substance.

**Key vocabulary:** pH scale, indicator, universal indicator, litmus, acid, alkali, neutral, pH meter, pH paper, colour chart, hydrogen ion concentration, acidic, alkaline, basic, neutral

#### SC-KS3-C086 — Acid-metal reactions
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Knowledge that acids react with metals to produce salt and hydrogen

**Teaching guidance:** Demonstrate the reaction of dilute hydrochloric acid with magnesium ribbon: observe fizzing (hydrogen gas produced), test the gas with a burning splint (squeaky pop confirms hydrogen). Write the general equation: acid + metal → salt + hydrogen. Investigate which metals react with acid and which do not — this connects to the reactivity series (SC-KS3-C097). Discuss safety: some metal-acid reactions are very vigorous (sodium with acid) while others are slow or do not occur (copper with dilute acid). Use word equations for all reactions observed.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think all metals react with acids — copper, silver, and gold do not react with dilute acids because they are below hydrogen in the reactivity series. Students may also confuse the name of the salt produced — the acid determines the salt: hydrochloric acid produces chlorides, sulfuric acid produces sulfates.

**Key vocabulary:** acid, metal, salt, hydrogen, reaction, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, magnesium, zinc, iron, copper, reactive, unreactive, squeaky pop test, gas, word equation

#### SC-KS3-C087 — Neutralization
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Knowledge that acids react with alkalis to produce salt and water

**Teaching guidance:** Demonstrate neutralisation by slowly adding dilute sodium hydroxide to dilute hydrochloric acid with universal indicator: the colour changes from red (acid) through green (neutral) to purple (alkaline). The general equation: acid + alkali → salt + water. Repeat with different acid-alkali combinations to show that different salts are produced (e.g., HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H₂O; H₂SO₄ + NaOH → Na₂SO₄ + H₂O). Connect to real-world applications: antacids neutralising stomach acid, treating acid rain in lakes, soil pH adjustment in agriculture.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think neutralisation always produces a substance with pH exactly 7 — this is only true if exactly the right proportions of acid and alkali are mixed. Students may also think that all salts are sodium chloride (table salt) — 'salt' in chemistry is a general term for the product of an acid-alkali reaction.

**Key vocabulary:** neutralisation, acid, alkali, salt, water, neutral, pH 7, indicator, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide, sulfuric acid, antacid, indigestion, word equation, product

#### SC-KS3-C088 — Catalysts
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding what catalysts do in chemical reactions

**Teaching guidance:** Demonstrate catalysis using manganese dioxide with hydrogen peroxide: without the catalyst, decomposition is very slow; with the catalyst, rapid fizzing occurs and oxygen gas is produced. Weigh the manganese dioxide before and after to show it is not used up. Explain that catalysts work by providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy. Discuss biological catalysts (enzymes) as a connection to SC-KS3-C040. Mention industrial catalysts: iron in the Haber process, platinum in catalytic converters.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think catalysts are used up in the reaction — emphasise that catalysts are recovered unchanged at the end. Students may think catalysts make impossible reactions happen — catalysts only speed up reactions that would occur anyway, they do not make new reactions possible. Students sometimes confuse catalysts with reactants — the catalyst is not consumed and does not appear in the balanced equation.

**Key vocabulary:** catalyst, reaction rate, activation energy, manganese dioxide, hydrogen peroxide, enzyme, biological catalyst, unchanged, alternative pathway, speed up, industrial catalyst, Haber process, catalytic converter

#### SC-KS3-C089 — Energy in state changes
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Qualitative understanding of energy changes during changes of state

**Teaching guidance:** Use the particle model to explain energy changes during changes of state. When a substance melts or boils, energy is transferred to the particles, increasing their potential energy (overcoming intermolecular forces) without increasing their kinetic energy — this is why temperature stays constant during a change of state. When a substance freezes or condenses, energy is released to the surroundings. Use heating curves to show the plateaux where changes of state occur. Connect to SC-KS3-C071 (changes of state) and SC-KS3-C115 (energy conservation).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think that if you are heating something, the temperature must always be rising — during a change of state, the energy goes into breaking intermolecular bonds rather than increasing temperature. Students may also think freezing releases cold — freezing is an exothermic process that releases heat energy to the surroundings.

**Key vocabulary:** energy, change of state, latent heat, melting, boiling, freezing, condensation, temperature, constant temperature, kinetic energy, potential energy, intermolecular force, heating curve, endothermic, exothermic

#### SC-KS3-C090 — Exothermic and endothermic
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 2

Qualitative understanding of exothermic and endothermic chemical reactions

**Teaching guidance:** Demonstrate exothermic reactions (combustion of magnesium, neutralisation, self-heating hand warmers) and endothermic reactions (dissolving ammonium nitrate in water — temperature drops, citric acid + sodium hydrogencarbonate). Use a thermometer or temperature probe to measure temperature changes. Classify reactions as exothermic (temperature increases, energy transferred to surroundings) or endothermic (temperature decreases, energy taken from surroundings). Draw simple energy level diagrams showing reactants and products. Connect to bond energy concepts qualitatively.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think endothermic reactions produce cold — clarify that they absorb energy from the surroundings, causing the temperature of the surroundings to decrease. Students may confuse exothermic with explosion — many exothermic reactions (hand warmers, respiration) are slow and controlled. Students sometimes think all reactions are exothermic — thermal decomposition and photosynthesis are endothermic.

**Key vocabulary:** exothermic, endothermic, energy change, temperature change, surroundings, combustion, neutralisation, thermal decomposition, energy level diagram, activation energy, bond breaking, bond making, thermometer

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS3-D008-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Chemistry at KS4 is rich in patterns — periodic table trends, reactivity series, reaction type categories — that allow pupils to predict the behaviour of unfamiliar substances.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Chemical reactions involve causal mechanisms (electron transfer causes bonding, acid-base reactions follow proton transfer) that explain observed phenomena rather than merely describing them.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

**SC-KS3-D008-CL002:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Sorting, classifying and identifying similarities directly trains pupils to recognise regularities and use them to predict or generalise.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Evidence and Argument**: What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Drawing conclusions from observations requires constructing a claim supported by specific evidence — not just describing what was seen.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'

**SC-KS3-D008-CL003:**
- **Cause and Effect** (primary): What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Fair testing and investigations are designed to isolate variables and establish causal relationships — the cognitive demand is reasoning from controlled evidence to causal claims.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Data from repeated investigations reveals patterns that allow pupils to generalise their findings beyond the specific test conditions.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**SC-KS3-D008-CL004:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Material properties link physical structure (molecular arrangement, surface texture) to functional behaviour (waterproofing, strength, flexibility) — the key question is always 'why does this material behave this way?'
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Properties can be sorted and classified into patterns (metals conduct, insulators don't), allowing pupils to make predictions about unfamiliar materials.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

## Domain: SC-KS3-D009 — Chemistry - The Periodic Table and Materials
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS3 | **Age:** 11-14 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
The periodic table and materials domain requires pupils to understand the periodic table as a systematic organisation of elements that reveals patterns in their properties. Pupils study the properties of metals and non-metals, the reactivity series, and the chemistry of selected groups including the alkali metals, halogens and noble gases. The statutory curriculum also includes study of the chemistry of ceramics, polymers and composites — the materials science that underpins modern technology. Pupils investigate the specific properties of these materials and understand how the choice of material for a given application is determined by matching material properties to functional requirements.

### Concepts (9)

#### SC-KS3-C091 — Element properties
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding that different elements have varying physical and chemical properties

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate the properties of different elements practically: compare the appearance, hardness, density, melting point, and electrical conductivity of samples (iron, copper, aluminium, sulfur, carbon). Use these observations to identify patterns and link to the periodic table. Discuss why different elements have different properties — relate to atomic structure at an introductory level (different numbers of protons, different electronic configurations). Group elements as metals or non-metals based on their properties.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think all metals are hard, shiny, and grey — sodium is soft enough to cut with a knife, mercury is liquid at room temperature, and copper and gold are not grey. Students may also think all non-metals are gases — carbon (diamond, graphite), sulfur, and phosphorus are solid non-metals at room temperature.

**Key vocabulary:** element, property, metal, non-metal, physical property, chemical property, melting point, boiling point, density, conductivity, hardness, lustre, malleable, ductile, brittle

#### SC-KS3-C092 — Mendeleev's Periodic Table
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding the principles underpinning the Periodic Table

**Teaching guidance:** Tell the story of Mendeleev's creation of the periodic table in 1869: he arranged elements by increasing atomic mass and grouped them by similar properties, famously leaving gaps for undiscovered elements and predicting their properties (germanium, gallium, scandium). When these elements were later discovered with properties matching his predictions, the periodic table was validated. Compare Mendeleev's table with the modern periodic table (arranged by atomic number rather than atomic mass). Use this as an example of how scientific models develop and gain acceptance through successful predictions.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think the modern periodic table is arranged by atomic mass (like Mendeleev's original) — clarify that the modern table is arranged by atomic number (number of protons). Students may believe Mendeleev discovered all the elements — he arranged known elements and predicted unknown ones.

**Key vocabulary:** Mendeleev, periodic table, atomic mass, atomic number, period, group, prediction, undiscovered elements, germanium, gallium, pattern, classification, arrangement, validation, scientific model

#### SC-KS3-C093 — Periodic Table structure **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 3

Knowledge of periods, groups, metals, and non-metals in the Periodic Table

**Teaching guidance:** Use a large periodic table wall chart for reference throughout chemistry lessons. Teach the structure: periods (horizontal rows — elements in the same period have the same number of electron shells), groups (vertical columns — elements in the same group have the same number of outer electrons and similar chemical properties). Identify key groups: Group 1 (alkali metals), Group 7 (halogens), Group 0 (noble gases). Locate the metals (left and centre) and non-metals (right). Have pupils use the periodic table to find information about elements.

**Common misconceptions:** Students confuse periods and groups — periods are horizontal rows, groups are vertical columns. Students may think the periodic table is just a list of elements — emphasise that its structure reveals patterns in element properties. Students sometimes think elements in the same period have similar properties — it is elements in the same group that have similar chemical properties.

**Key vocabulary:** periodic table, period, group, row, column, metal, non-metal, alkali metal, halogen, noble gas, transition metal, atomic number, element, symbol, electron, shell

#### SC-KS3-C094 — Predicting reactions
Type: skill | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 4

Ability to predict reaction patterns using the Periodic Table

**Teaching guidance:** Use the periodic table to predict reaction patterns: elements in the same group react in similar ways because they have the same number of outer electrons. Demonstrate with Group 1 metals (lithium, sodium, potassium in water — increasing reactivity down the group) and Group 7 halogens (displacement reactions — chlorine displaces bromine, bromine displaces iodine). Have pupils predict the properties and reactions of elements they have not studied, based on their position in the periodic table. Connect to the reactivity series (SC-KS3-C097).

**Common misconceptions:** Students sometimes think they need to memorise the properties of every element — emphasise that the power of the periodic table is that you can predict properties from position. Students may also think that elements in the same period have similar reactivity — reactivity trends run down groups, not across periods.

**Key vocabulary:** predict, pattern, group, period, trend, reactivity, alkali metal, halogen, noble gas, displacement, similar properties, outer electrons, periodic table, extrapolation, chemical property

#### SC-KS3-C095 — Metal and non-metal properties **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 4

Knowledge of the properties of metals and non-metals

**Teaching guidance:** Create a comparison table of metal vs non-metal properties. Metals: shiny (lustrous), good conductors of heat and electricity, malleable (can be hammered into shape), ductile (can be drawn into wire), generally high melting points, sonorous (ring when struck). Non-metals: dull appearance, poor conductors (insulators), brittle (if solid), generally low melting points. Demonstrate these properties with samples. Discuss exceptions: graphite (a non-metal that conducts electricity), mercury (a liquid metal). Use the staircase line on the periodic table to locate the metal/non-metal boundary.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think the metal/non-metal distinction is absolute — some elements near the boundary (silicon, germanium) have properties of both and are called metalloids or semi-metals. Students may also think all metals are magnetic — only iron, cobalt, and nickel are ferromagnetic.

**Key vocabulary:** metal, non-metal, physical property, lustrous, conductor, insulator, malleable, ductile, brittle, sonorous, melting point, density, thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, exception, metalloid

#### SC-KS3-C096 — Oxide acidity
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding the chemical properties of metal and non-metal oxides with respect to acidity

**Teaching guidance:** Demonstrate the reactions of metal and non-metal oxides with water: metal oxides (e.g., sodium oxide) dissolve to form alkaline solutions, non-metal oxides (e.g., sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide) dissolve to form acidic solutions. Test the solutions with universal indicator to confirm. Connect to acid rain: burning fossil fuels produces SO₂ and NO₂, which dissolve in rainwater to form sulfuric and nitric acids. Have pupils write word equations for oxide reactions with water. Connect to acids and alkalis (SC-KS3-C084).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think all oxides are dangerous or acidic — metal oxides are typically alkaline (basic), and some oxides are neutral (water itself is an oxide of hydrogen). Students may also confuse the oxide with the element — sulfur dioxide has very different properties from elemental sulfur.

**Key vocabulary:** metal oxide, non-metal oxide, acidic, alkaline, basic, sodium oxide, magnesium oxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, acid rain, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, universal indicator, dissolve, solution

#### SC-KS3-C097 — Reactivity series **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 3

Knowledge of the order of metals and carbon in the reactivity series

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce the reactivity series by comparing how vigorously different metals react with water and with dilute acids: potassium and sodium react vigorously with water, magnesium and zinc react with acid but not cold water, copper and gold do not react with either. Demonstrate displacement reactions: place iron nails in copper sulfate solution — the iron becomes coated in copper and the solution changes from blue to green, showing iron has displaced copper. Arrange metals in order of reactivity and include carbon and hydrogen for comparison. Connect to extraction of metals (SC-KS3-C098).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often confuse the reactivity series with the periodic table — the reactivity series is an empirical ranking based on observations of reactions, not directly linked to position in the periodic table. Students may also think that a less reactive metal displaces a more reactive one — the more reactive metal always displaces the less reactive one.

**Key vocabulary:** reactivity series, reactive, unreactive, displacement, metal, potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, aluminium, zinc, iron, copper, silver, gold, carbon, hydrogen, competition

#### SC-KS3-C098 — Metal extraction
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding the use of carbon in obtaining metals from metal oxides

**Teaching guidance:** Explain that metals can be extracted from their ores (naturally occurring compounds) by reduction. Demonstrate the reduction of copper oxide with carbon: heat copper oxide and carbon powder together — shiny copper metal appears. Explain that carbon can only extract metals that are less reactive than carbon (iron, copper, lead, zinc). More reactive metals (aluminium, sodium) require electrolysis. Discuss the blast furnace for iron extraction as an industrial application. Connect to the reactivity series (SC-KS3-C097) and environmental considerations of mining.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think all metals are found as pure elements in the ground — most metals are found as compounds (ores) and must be extracted. Students may confuse reduction (removal of oxygen / gain of electrons) with the everyday meaning of 'reducing'. Students sometimes think electrolysis is used for all metal extraction — only metals more reactive than carbon require electrolysis.

**Key vocabulary:** extraction, metal ore, reduction, oxidation, carbon, blast furnace, iron ore, copper oxide, electrolysis, reactive, smelting, coke, limestone, haematite, recycling, environmental impact

#### SC-KS3-C099 — Material types
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Qualitative knowledge of properties of ceramics, polymers, and composites

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate the properties of ceramics (clay, glass, brick — hard, brittle, heat-resistant, electrical insulators), polymers (plastics, rubber — flexible, lightweight, poor conductors, mouldable), and composites (concrete, fibreglass, carbon fibre — combine properties of two or more materials). For each material type, discuss the relationship between properties and uses. Have pupils evaluate which material would be best for a specific application (e.g., building a bridge, making a phone case, insulating a house). Connect to sustainability and recycling.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think all plastics are the same — there are many different polymers with very different properties (thermoplastics can be remoulded, thermosets cannot). Students may think 'natural' materials are always better than 'synthetic' ones — synthetic materials are often designed with superior properties for specific applications.

**Key vocabulary:** ceramic, polymer, composite, material, property, hard, brittle, flexible, lightweight, conductor, insulator, heat-resistant, reinforced, fibre, matrix, application, sustainability, recycling

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS3-D009-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Sorting, classifying and identifying similarities directly trains pupils to recognise regularities and use them to predict or generalise.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Evidence and Argument**: What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Drawing conclusions from observations requires constructing a claim supported by specific evidence — not just describing what was seen.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'

**SC-KS3-D009-CL002:**
- **Cause and Effect** (primary): What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Fair testing and investigations are designed to isolate variables and establish causal relationships — the cognitive demand is reasoning from controlled evidence to causal claims.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Data from repeated investigations reveals patterns that allow pupils to generalise their findings beyond the specific test conditions.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**SC-KS3-D009-CL003:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Material properties link physical structure (molecular arrangement, surface texture) to functional behaviour (waterproofing, strength, flexibility) — the key question is always 'why does this material behave this way?'
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Properties can be sorted and classified into patterns (metals conduct, insulators don't), allowing pupils to make predictions about unfamiliar materials.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

## Domain: SC-KS3-D010 — Chemistry - Earth and Atmosphere
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS3 | **Age:** 11-14 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Earth and atmosphere at KS3 develops pupils' understanding of the geochemistry of the Earth's crust, the rock cycle, and the composition and chemistry of the atmosphere. Pupils revisit the rock cycle from primary science at a more detailed level, understanding the processes of weathering, erosion, sedimentation, metamorphism and volcanism that continuously reshape the Earth's surface. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to understand the composition of the atmosphere, the carbon cycle and the chemistry of combustion — providing the scientific basis for understanding climate change and the impact of human activity on atmospheric composition. Pupils apply their understanding of chemistry to geological contexts, connecting material science to environmental science.

### Concepts (7)

#### SC-KS3-C100 — Earth composition
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Knowledge of the composition of the Earth

**Teaching guidance:** Teach the elemental composition of the Earth: the crust is mainly silicon and oxygen (as silicate minerals), the core is mainly iron and nickel. Compare the composition of the crust, atmosphere, and oceans. Use data tables to show the most abundant elements in each layer. Connect to the rock cycle (SC-KS3-C102) and the formation of minerals. Have pupils investigate the uses of common elements obtained from the Earth's crust (iron for steel, aluminium for transport, silicon for electronics).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think the Earth is solid throughout — clarify that the outer core is liquid (molten iron and nickel) while the inner core is solid due to immense pressure. Students may also think the crust is thick relative to the Earth — the crust is proportionally thinner than the skin of an apple.

**Key vocabulary:** Earth, crust, mantle, core, composition, element, mineral, silicate, iron, nickel, oxygen, silicon, aluminium, abundance, rock, ore, resource

#### SC-KS3-C101 — Earth structure
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Knowledge of the structure of the Earth (crust, mantle, core)

**Teaching guidance:** Use a scale model (e.g., a boiled egg — shell = crust, white = mantle, yolk = core) to illustrate the Earth's layered structure. Teach the properties of each layer: crust (thin, rocky, rigid), mantle (thick, semi-solid, convection currents), outer core (liquid iron and nickel), inner core (solid iron and nickel, extremely hot). Discuss how we know about the Earth's interior — seismic waves from earthquakes travel differently through different materials. Connect to plate tectonics and volcanic activity qualitatively.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think the mantle is entirely liquid magma — the mantle is mostly solid but can flow very slowly (like a very viscous liquid) over geological time. Students may also confuse the mantle with magma — magma forms when parts of the mantle melt under specific conditions (pressure release, water addition).

**Key vocabulary:** crust, mantle, core, outer core, inner core, layer, seismic wave, tectonic plate, convection, iron, nickel, temperature, pressure, density, earthquake, volcano

#### SC-KS3-C102 — Rock cycle
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding the rock cycle and formation of igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks

**Teaching guidance:** Use a rock cycle diagram to show how rocks are continuously formed, broken down, and reformed. Teach the three rock types: igneous (formed from cooled magma/lava — granite, basalt), sedimentary (formed from compressed sediments — sandstone, limestone, mudstone), and metamorphic (formed by heat and pressure changing existing rocks — marble from limestone, slate from mudstone). Examine rock samples and have pupils identify them based on their properties. Connect processes: weathering → erosion → transportation → deposition → burial → compaction → cementation. Link to Earth's structure (SC-KS3-C101).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think the rock cycle is a fixed sequence (always igneous → sedimentary → metamorphic → igneous) — any rock type can become any other rock type depending on the processes acting on it. Students may confuse weathering (breaking down rocks in place) with erosion (transporting rock fragments away). Students sometimes think metamorphic rocks must have been melted — metamorphism changes rocks by heat and pressure without melting.

**Key vocabulary:** rock cycle, igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic, magma, lava, weathering, erosion, deposition, compaction, cementation, crystallisation, metamorphism, granite, basalt, limestone, sandstone, marble, slate

#### SC-KS3-C103 — Earth resources
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding Earth as a source of limited resources and the importance of recycling

**Teaching guidance:** Discuss that the Earth provides essential resources: metals from ores, fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas), building materials (stone, sand, gravel), water, and soil. Emphasise that many of these are finite (non-renewable) and will eventually run out. Introduce the concept of sustainability: using resources at a rate that allows them to be replaced or recycled. Discuss recycling of metals, plastics, and glass — why it matters and what happens at a materials level. Have pupils evaluate the environmental impact of resource extraction (mining, drilling, quarrying).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think recycling solves all resource problems — recycling requires energy and not all materials can be recycled indefinitely. Students may also think renewable resources are unlimited — even renewable resources (timber, fish stocks) can be depleted if used faster than they regenerate.

**Key vocabulary:** natural resource, finite, non-renewable, renewable, fossil fuel, ore, extraction, mining, quarrying, recycling, sustainability, environmental impact, conservation, landfill, reuse, reduce

#### SC-KS3-C104 — Carbon cycle
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding the carbon cycle and its role in Earth systems

**Teaching guidance:** Draw the carbon cycle as a diagram showing how carbon moves between the atmosphere (as CO₂), living organisms (as organic compounds), the oceans (as dissolved CO₂ and carbonates), and rocks (as fossil fuels and carbonates). Identify key processes: photosynthesis (removes CO₂ from atmosphere), respiration (returns CO₂), combustion (returns CO₂ rapidly), decomposition (returns CO₂ slowly), and fossilisation (locks carbon away for millions of years). Quantify the flows where possible. Connect to climate change (SC-KS3-C106) and photosynthesis/respiration.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think carbon only moves in one direction (from atmosphere to organisms) — the carbon cycle involves continuous two-way movement between multiple reservoirs. Students may also think that burning fossil fuels creates new carbon — it releases carbon that was locked away millions of years ago, increasing the total carbon in the atmosphere.

**Key vocabulary:** carbon cycle, carbon dioxide, photosynthesis, respiration, combustion, decomposition, fossil fuel, carbonate, ocean, atmosphere, organic compound, carbon sink, carbon source, reservoir, flux

#### SC-KS3-C105 — Atmosphere composition
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Knowledge of the composition of Earth's atmosphere

**Teaching guidance:** Teach the current composition of Earth's atmosphere: nitrogen (~78%), oxygen (~21%), argon (~0.9%), carbon dioxide (~0.04%), plus variable amounts of water vapour. Compare with the early atmosphere (mainly CO₂, little or no oxygen) and discuss how it changed over billions of years: photosynthetic organisms produced oxygen, CO₂ was removed by dissolving in oceans and forming carbonate rocks. Use pie charts to represent composition visually. Connect to the carbon cycle (SC-KS3-C104) and climate change (SC-KS3-C106).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often overestimate the proportion of CO₂ in the atmosphere — it is approximately 0.04%, a trace gas, but its greenhouse effect is disproportionately large. Students may also think oxygen has always been present in the atmosphere — Earth's early atmosphere had virtually no free oxygen; it appeared only after photosynthetic organisms evolved.

**Key vocabulary:** atmosphere, nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, water vapour, composition, percentage, early atmosphere, volcanic activity, photosynthesis, ozone layer, greenhouse gas, trace gas, noble gas

#### SC-KS3-C106 — Climate change
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding how human CO2 production impacts climate

**Teaching guidance:** Present the scientific evidence for climate change: rising global temperatures (from temperature records), rising CO₂ levels (from ice cores and atmospheric measurements at Mauna Loa), melting ice caps, rising sea levels, and changing weather patterns. Explain the greenhouse effect: CO₂ and methane in the atmosphere trap infrared radiation, warming the Earth — this is natural and necessary for life, but human activities (burning fossil fuels, deforestation, agriculture) are increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. Have pupils analyse real climate data and graphs. Discuss both the evidence and the scientific consensus.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often confuse weather with climate — weather is short-term and local, climate is long-term and regional or global. Students may think the greenhouse effect is entirely harmful — the natural greenhouse effect makes Earth habitable; the problem is the enhanced greenhouse effect from additional human-produced greenhouse gases. Students sometimes confuse the ozone hole with climate change — they are different environmental issues.

**Key vocabulary:** climate change, global warming, greenhouse effect, greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, methane, fossil fuel, temperature, ice core, sea level, infrared radiation, atmosphere, evidence, scientific consensus, mitigation, adaptation

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS3-D010-CL001:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Earth science topics involve large-scale systems (water cycle, solar system, rock cycle) where components interact in cycles — mapping the system helps pupils understand processes they cannot directly observe.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Stability and Change**: What keeps this stable, what causes change, and how quickly does change happen?
  Why: Geological, atmospheric and astronomical systems exhibit both stability (seasons repeat, rock types persist) and change (erosion, climate shifts), making stability-and-change a productive alternative framing.
  AI instruction: Use the STABILITY AND CHANGE lens: prompt pupils to identify what conditions keep a system in balance, what disrupts equilibrium, and how change can be gradual or sudden. Useful questions: 'What keeps this the same?', 'What would tip it into change?', 'Is the change reversible?', 'How fast is this changing, and why?'

**SC-KS3-D010-CL002:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Material properties link physical structure (molecular arrangement, surface texture) to functional behaviour (waterproofing, strength, flexibility) — the key question is always 'why does this material behave this way?'
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Properties can be sorted and classified into patterns (metals conduct, insulators don't), allowing pupils to make predictions about unfamiliar materials.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

  Why: Food chains, food webs and ecosystems are system models: pupils map components (producers, consumers, decomposers), trace energy flows, and predict what happens when one part changes.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Stability and Change**: What keeps this stable, what causes change, and how quickly does change happen?

  - WS-KS3-006 (Interpreting data and identifying patterns) [secondary_research]

## Domain: SC-KS3-D011 — Physics - Energy
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS3 | **Age:** 11-14 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Energy at KS3 introduces a more rigorous, quantitative treatment of energy than was possible in primary school, moving from informal descriptions of energy 'being used up' to the scientific principle of energy conservation and transfer. Pupils are introduced to the concept of energy stores (kinetic, gravitational, thermal, chemical, elastic, electromagnetic, nuclear) and energy transfers between them, and learn to calculate energy values using standard equations. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to understand heating and cooling as processes involving energy transfer, to recognise the factors that affect the rate of energy transfer, and to understand the concept of efficiency as the ratio of useful to total energy output. This quantitative approach to energy underpins the physics, chemistry and biology of KS4.

### Concepts (11)

#### SC-KS3-C107 — Food energy values
Type: skill | Complexity: 1 | Teaching weight: 1

Ability to compare energy values of different foods using labels

**Teaching guidance:** Have pupils compare food labels from different products (cereal, crisps, fruit, chocolate) and rank them by energy content per 100g. Discuss the units: kilojoules (kJ) are the SI unit, kilocalories (kcal) are also widely used on food packaging. Convert between kJ and kcal (1 kcal ≈ 4.2 kJ). Link to the concept that food is a chemical energy store — the energy was originally captured from sunlight by photosynthesis. Connect to balanced diet (SC-KS3-C036) and energy requirements (SC-KS3-C037).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think 'energy-dense' foods are always bad — energy-dense foods (nuts, oils) are important in a balanced diet, especially for active people. Students may confuse 'low calorie' with 'healthy' — a food can be low calorie but lack essential nutrients.

**Key vocabulary:** energy, kilojoule, kilocalorie, food label, energy content, chemical energy, nutrition, comparison, per 100g, daily intake, guideline daily amount, calorimetry

#### SC-KS3-C108 — Power ratings
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Understanding and comparing power ratings of appliances in watts

**Teaching guidance:** Use appliance labels and data plates to identify power ratings in watts (W) and kilowatts (kW). Compare the power ratings of common appliances: a phone charger (~5 W), a light bulb (~60 W), a kettle (~3,000 W), an electric shower (~8,500 W). Explain that power is the rate at which energy is transferred — a higher power appliance transfers more energy per second. Calculate energy use: energy (J) = power (W) × time (s), or energy (kWh) = power (kW) × time (h). Connect to fuel costs (SC-KS3-C110) and energy conservation.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often confuse power and energy — power is the rate of energy transfer (joules per second), while energy is the total amount transferred. Students may think a higher-powered appliance always costs more to run — cost depends on both power and how long the appliance is used.

**Key vocabulary:** power, watt, kilowatt, energy, joule, kilowatt-hour, power rating, appliance, rate, energy transfer, data plate, electricity meter, comparison, efficiency

#### SC-KS3-C109 — Energy transfer amounts
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Ability to compare amounts of energy transferred in joules and kilowatt-hours

**Teaching guidance:** Teach both SI units (joules) and commercial units (kilowatt-hours) for energy. Calculate energy transferred using E = P × t in joules (with power in watts and time in seconds) and in kilowatt-hours (with power in kilowatts and time in hours). Compare the energy used by different appliances over different time periods. Use real electricity bill data to make the connection between energy calculations and household costs. Connect to power ratings (SC-KS3-C108) and fuel costs (SC-KS3-C110).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think a kilowatt-hour is a unit of power — it is a unit of energy (the energy transferred by a 1 kW device in 1 hour = 3,600,000 J). Students may struggle with the unit conversions between J and kWh — practise both directions with real examples.

**Key vocabulary:** energy, joule, kilowatt-hour, power, time, calculation, watt, kilowatt, formula, E = P × t, unit, SI unit, commercial unit, conversion, comparison, electricity bill

#### SC-KS3-C110 — Fuel costs
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Understanding domestic fuel bills, fuel use, and costs

**Teaching guidance:** Analyse a real or simulated household electricity bill: identify the meter readings, the number of units (kWh) used, the cost per unit, and the standing charge. Have pupils calculate the cost of running specific appliances: cost = energy used (kWh) × price per unit (p/kWh). Discuss ways to reduce energy bills: using energy-efficient appliances, switching off devices, improving insulation. Compare the costs of different energy resources (gas, electricity, oil). Connect to energy resources (SC-KS3-C111) and energy conservation.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think electricity is free once you have paid for the appliance — electricity has an ongoing cost based on energy consumed. Students may also think that turning a device 'off' at the switch means it uses no energy — many devices on standby still consume power.

**Key vocabulary:** fuel bill, electricity bill, unit, kilowatt-hour, meter reading, cost, price per unit, standing charge, gas, electricity, tariff, energy efficiency, saving, consumption, comparison

#### SC-KS3-C111 — Energy resources
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Knowledge of different fuels and energy resources

**Teaching guidance:** Classify energy resources as renewable (solar, wind, hydroelectric, tidal, geothermal, biomass) or non-renewable (coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear). For each resource, discuss: how it generates electricity, advantages, disadvantages, and environmental impact. Use data on UK energy generation to analyse the current energy mix and how it is changing. Have pupils evaluate which combination of energy resources would best meet the UK's needs. Connect to climate change (SC-KS3-C106) and sustainability.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think nuclear energy is renewable because it does not produce CO₂ during generation — nuclear energy uses finite uranium fuel and produces radioactive waste, making it non-renewable. Students may also think renewable energy sources have no environmental impact — wind farms affect wildlife, hydroelectric dams alter river ecosystems, and solar panels require mining for materials.

**Key vocabulary:** energy resource, renewable, non-renewable, fossil fuel, solar, wind, hydroelectric, tidal, geothermal, biomass, nuclear, generator, turbine, environmental impact, carbon footprint, sustainability

#### SC-KS3-C112 — Simple machines
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding force-distance trade-offs in simple machines

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate simple machines (levers, pulleys, ramps/inclined planes, gears, wheels and axles) to demonstrate the force-distance trade-off: a machine allows you to use a smaller force, but you must apply it over a greater distance. The total work done (energy transferred) remains the same. Demonstrate with a lever: a longer lever arm means less effort but more distance. Calculate work done = force × distance. Connect to moments (SC-KS3-C124) and energy conservation (SC-KS3-C115).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think machines create energy or multiply effort for free — machines only change the direction or magnitude of force; the total work done (energy transferred) is always the same (or more, due to friction). Students may also think levers always reduce the force needed — a lever can also increase force at the expense of distance, or vice versa.

**Key vocabulary:** simple machine, lever, pulley, ramp, inclined plane, gear, wheel and axle, force, distance, work done, mechanical advantage, effort, load, trade-off, energy transfer, joule

#### SC-KS3-C113 — Thermal equilibrium
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding heat transfer from hot to cold objects and the role of insulators

**Teaching guidance:** Demonstrate thermal equilibrium by placing a hot object and a cold object in contact and monitoring temperature changes with thermometers or data loggers. The hot object cools and the cold object warms until both reach the same temperature. Explain using the particle model: energy transfers from particles with more kinetic energy (hot) to those with less (cold). Investigate insulation: compare the rate of cooling of hot water in insulated vs uninsulated containers. Identify conductors (metals) and insulators (plastic, air, wool). Connect to energy transfer processes and particle motion.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think cold transfers to hot objects ('the cold gets in') — only energy transfers, and it always moves from hot to cold. There is no 'cold energy'. Students may also think insulation adds heat — insulation slows the rate of energy transfer; it does not produce energy.

**Key vocabulary:** thermal equilibrium, heat transfer, conduction, convection, radiation, conductor, insulator, temperature, energy, kinetic energy, particle, hot, cold, cooling curve, data logger

#### SC-KS3-C114 — Energy transfer processes **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 4

Knowledge of processes that involve energy transfer (motion, gravity, electricity, springs, metabolism, combustion)

**Teaching guidance:** Identify different processes that involve energy transfer: heating (thermal energy transfer by conduction, convection, or radiation), electrical work (energy transferred by electric current), mechanical work (energy transferred by forces), light (energy transferred by electromagnetic radiation), sound (energy transferred by vibrations). For each process, identify the energy stores involved — where the energy comes from and where it goes. Use energy flow diagrams or Sankey diagrams to represent transfers. Connect to energy conservation (SC-KS3-C115).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often say energy is 'used up' — energy is transferred from one store to another, never created or destroyed. Students may also confuse energy stores with energy transfers — kinetic, thermal, and gravitational potential are energy stores; heating, light, and sound are energy transfer processes.

**Key vocabulary:** energy transfer, process, heating, conduction, convection, radiation, electrical work, mechanical work, light, sound, energy store, kinetic, thermal, chemical, gravitational, elastic, electromagnetic, nuclear

#### SC-KS3-C115 — Energy conservation **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 3

Understanding that total energy is conserved in any change

**Teaching guidance:** Demonstrate energy conservation using a pendulum: gravitational potential energy converts to kinetic energy and back again. The total energy remains constant (minus a small amount lost to thermal energy through air resistance and friction). Investigate the bouncing ball: measure the height of successive bounces to show energy is dissipated with each bounce but total energy is conserved. Use Sankey diagrams to show that input energy equals the sum of useful and wasted outputs. Emphasise that conservation of energy is a fundamental law of physics, not a suggestion to save energy.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often confuse 'conservation of energy' (a physics law stating energy cannot be created or destroyed) with 'conserving energy' (reducing waste in everyday life). Students may think energy disappears when an object slows down — the kinetic energy is transferred to thermal energy in the surroundings through friction and air resistance.

**Key vocabulary:** conservation of energy, law, total energy, dissipation, useful energy, wasted energy, Sankey diagram, efficiency, gravitational potential energy, kinetic energy, thermal energy, friction, pendulum, closed system

#### SC-KS3-C116 — Energy in systems
Type: skill | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 4 | Fan-out: 2

Ability to describe energy changes in systems over time

**Teaching guidance:** Use multiple examples to trace energy changes through a system over time: a ball thrown upwards (chemical energy in muscles → kinetic → gravitational potential → kinetic → thermal and sound on impact), a battery-powered car (chemical → electrical → kinetic → thermal through friction), a solar panel powering a lamp (electromagnetic → electrical → light + thermal). Have pupils create energy flow narratives for complex systems. Use quantitative calculations where possible: calculate changes in gravitational potential energy (Ep = mgh) and kinetic energy (Ek = ½mv²).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often describe energy changes as a chain (A → B → C) without recognising that some energy is dissipated at every step — draw attention to the thermal energy transferred to the surroundings at each stage. Students may think that energy starts from nowhere — trace every energy change back to its ultimate source (usually the Sun for everyday examples).

**Key vocabulary:** energy change, energy store, system, kinetic energy, gravitational potential energy, chemical energy, thermal energy, electrical energy, elastic potential energy, transfer, dissipation, efficiency, Ep = mgh, Ek = ½mv²

#### SC-KS3-C117 — Physical mechanisms
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding physical processes as mechanisms for energy changes

**Teaching guidance:** Connect physical mechanisms to energy changes: when a force causes an object to accelerate, work is done and energy is transferred to the kinetic energy store; when an object is lifted against gravity, energy is transferred to the gravitational potential energy store; when a spring is stretched, energy is transferred to the elastic potential energy store; when an electric current flows through a component, energy is transferred from the chemical store of the battery. Have pupils identify the physical mechanism responsible for each energy change in a given scenario.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often describe energy changes without identifying the mechanism — push for explanations of how energy is transferred (by which force or process). Students may think energy changes happen spontaneously without a cause — every energy transfer has a physical mechanism driving it.

**Key vocabulary:** mechanism, force, work done, energy transfer, acceleration, gravity, lifting, stretching, compression, electric current, resistance, heating, radiation, conduction, convection, physical process

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS3-D011-CL001:**
- **Energy and Matter** (primary): Where does the energy come from, where does it go, and is anything conserved?
  Why: Energy clusters require pupils to trace where energy comes from, how it is transferred or transformed, and where it ends up — conservation and flow are the central ideas.

**SC-KS3-D011-CL002:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Food chains, food webs and ecosystems are system models: pupils map components (producers, consumers, decomposers), trace energy flows, and predict what happens when one part changes.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Stability and Change**: What keeps this stable, what causes change, and how quickly does change happen?
  Why: Ecosystems maintain dynamic equilibria that can be disrupted by changes to one component — exploring what keeps the system stable and what destabilises it is an equally powerful framing.

Useful questions: 'What keeps this the same?', 'What would tip it into change?', 'Is the change reversible?', 'How fast is this changing, and why?'

**SC-KS3-D011-CL003:**

## Domain: SC-KS3-D012 — Physics - Motion and Forces
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS3 | **Age:** 11-14 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Motion and forces at KS3 introduces Newton's laws of motion as the mathematical framework for describing and predicting the movement of objects. Pupils learn to describe motion quantitatively using speed, velocity and acceleration, and to represent motion using distance-time and velocity-time graphs. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to apply Newton's first, second and third laws of motion to a range of situations, understanding the relationship between resultant force, mass and acceleration. Pupils also study pressure in fluids, moments and levers, and the principle of moments — applying mathematical reasoning to physical situations. This domain provides the mechanical foundations for understanding transportation, engineering and the physical world.

### Concepts (17)

#### SC-KS3-C118 — Speed calculation
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding and calculating speed using the equation speed = distance ÷ time

**Teaching guidance:** Start with measuring distances and times practically: pupils walk, run, or move toy cars over measured distances and time each journey. Calculate speed using the equation: speed = distance ÷ time (v = s/t). Practise rearranging the equation to find distance (s = v × t) or time (t = s/v). Use the formula triangle as a scaffolding tool. Include both simple calculations and multi-step problems. Use real-world contexts: speed of vehicles, animals, sound, and light. Discuss the difference between instantaneous speed and average speed.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often confuse speed and velocity — speed is a scalar (magnitude only), velocity is a vector (magnitude and direction). At KS3, focus on speed but introduce the distinction. Students may also think that a faster object has always travelled further — distance depends on both speed and time.

**Key vocabulary:** speed, distance, time, calculation, equation, v = s/t, metres per second, kilometres per hour, miles per hour, average speed, instantaneous speed, formula triangle, rearrangement, unit conversion

#### SC-KS3-C119 — Distance-time graphs
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Ability to represent and interpret journeys on distance-time graphs

**Teaching guidance:** Teach how to draw and interpret distance-time graphs: time on the x-axis, distance on the y-axis. A horizontal line means stationary, a straight diagonal line means constant speed, a steeper gradient means faster speed, and a curved line means changing speed (acceleration or deceleration). Have pupils draw distance-time graphs from descriptions of journeys. Calculate speed from the gradient of the graph. Use real data from practical work (e.g., trolley on a ramp with a ticker timer, or motion sensors connected to data loggers). Compare different journeys on the same axes.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often interpret a distance-time graph as a picture of the journey — a downward slope means the object is returning to the start, not going downhill. Students may confuse distance-time graphs with velocity-time graphs — on a distance-time graph, the gradient gives speed; on a velocity-time graph, the gradient gives acceleration.

**Key vocabulary:** distance-time graph, axis, gradient, slope, stationary, constant speed, acceleration, deceleration, curve, straight line, horizontal, interpretation, journey, motion, data logger

#### SC-KS3-C120 — Relative motion
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding relative motion between moving objects

**Teaching guidance:** Discuss relative motion using everyday examples: two cars travelling in the same direction at similar speeds appear almost stationary relative to each other, but both appear fast to a person standing on the pavement. A person on a moving train throwing a ball forward — the ball moves faster relative to the ground but at a low speed relative to the train. Use videos or simulations to demonstrate relative motion. Discuss how relative motion affects our perception of speed. Connect to reference frames at a basic level.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think motion is absolute — clarify that all motion is relative to a reference point. A person sitting on a moving bus is stationary relative to the bus but moving relative to the ground. Students may struggle to add velocities when objects move in opposite directions — two objects approaching each other at 30 mph have a relative velocity of 60 mph.

**Key vocabulary:** relative motion, reference frame, observer, velocity, speed, direction, relative velocity, moving object, stationary, perspective, apparent motion, approaching, receding

#### SC-KS3-C121 — Force concept **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 1 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 6

Understanding forces as pushes or pulls from interactions between objects

**Teaching guidance:** Begin with the intuitive idea that forces are pushes and pulls, then formalise: forces arise from interactions between two objects. Every force has a pair — if person A pushes person B, person B pushes back on person A (Newton's third law, without naming it). Classify forces as contact forces (friction, air resistance, tension, normal force) or non-contact forces (gravity, magnetic, electrostatic). Use force arrows to show direction and magnitude. Identify forces acting on objects in everyday situations: a book on a table, a falling ball, a person standing.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think a force is needed to keep an object moving — this is the Aristotelian misconception that Newton's first law corrects (an object continues at constant velocity unless acted on by a resultant force). Students may also think heavier objects fall faster — in a vacuum, all objects fall at the same rate regardless of mass.

**Key vocabulary:** force, push, pull, interaction, contact force, non-contact force, gravity, friction, air resistance, tension, normal force, compression, weight, newton, force arrow

#### SC-KS3-C122 — Force diagrams
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Ability to use force arrows in diagrams and add forces in one dimension

**Teaching guidance:** Teach pupils to draw force diagrams using arrows: the length of the arrow represents the magnitude of the force, and the direction of the arrow shows the direction of the force. Practise adding forces that act in the same line: forces in the same direction add together, forces in opposite directions subtract. Introduce the concept of resultant force — the single force that has the same effect as all the individual forces combined. Work through examples: a tug of war (horizontal forces), a falling object with air resistance (vertical forces). Connect to balanced and unbalanced forces (SC-KS3-C123).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think force arrows show how objects move, not the forces acting on them — clarify that arrows represent forces, and the resultant force determines how motion changes. Students may struggle with subtracting forces in opposite directions — use number lines to visualise.

**Key vocabulary:** force diagram, force arrow, free body diagram, resultant force, magnitude, direction, addition, subtraction, one dimension, vector, scale, net force, balanced, unbalanced

#### SC-KS3-C123 — Balanced and unbalanced forces **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 3

Understanding the difference between balanced and unbalanced forces

**Teaching guidance:** Demonstrate balanced forces: a book on a table has weight acting downwards and a normal reaction force acting upwards — these are equal in size and opposite in direction, so the book remains stationary. Demonstrate unbalanced forces: push a trolley with a constant force and it accelerates (the push is greater than friction). The key insight: balanced forces mean no change in motion (object stays still or continues at constant speed); unbalanced forces cause a change in motion (acceleration or deceleration). Use force diagrams to analyse each situation.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think balanced forces mean the object must be stationary — an object with balanced forces can be moving at constant speed in a straight line (Newton's first law). Students also think a moving object must have a net force acting on it — an object at constant velocity has balanced forces.

**Key vocabulary:** balanced forces, unbalanced forces, resultant force, zero resultant, equilibrium, acceleration, deceleration, constant speed, stationary, Newton's first law, change in motion, net force

#### SC-KS3-C124 — Moments
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding moments as the turning effect of a force

**Teaching guidance:** Define a moment as the turning effect of a force: moment = force × perpendicular distance from the pivot (M = F × d). Demonstrate using a metre rule balanced on a fulcrum with masses at different positions. Investigate the principle of moments: a seesaw balances when the total clockwise moment equals the total anticlockwise moment. Have pupils calculate moments and predict where to place masses to achieve balance. Real-world applications: spanners (longer handle = larger moment = easier to turn), wheelbarrows, door handles. Connect to simple machines (SC-KS3-C112).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often confuse moment with force — a moment depends on both the force AND the distance from the pivot. A small force at a large distance can have the same moment as a large force at a small distance. Students may think the distance is measured to any point — it must be the perpendicular distance from the pivot to the line of action of the force.

**Key vocabulary:** moment, turning effect, force, distance, pivot, fulcrum, clockwise, anticlockwise, principle of moments, balance, lever, spanner, torque, perpendicular, M = F × d, newton-metre

#### SC-KS3-C125 — Contact forces
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Knowledge of forces from deformation, friction, and resistance to motion

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate contact forces practically: stretch a spring and observe it deform (elastic deformation — it returns to its original shape); bend a paperclip and observe permanent deformation (plastic deformation). Investigate friction by pulling objects across different surfaces with a force meter — rougher surfaces have more friction. Demonstrate air resistance: drop a flat piece of paper and a scrunched piece — same mass, different air resistance. Discuss how friction and air resistance are useful (brakes, tyres) and problematic (wasted energy, wear). Connect to Hooke's Law (SC-KS3-C127) and forces and motion (SC-KS3-C134).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think friction only slows things down — friction also allows us to walk (grip), hold objects, and drive vehicles (tyre traction). Without friction, we could not move. Students may also think air resistance does not exist on slow-moving objects — air resistance acts on all moving objects in air, but its effect is negligible at very low speeds.

**Key vocabulary:** contact force, friction, air resistance, drag, normal force, tension, compression, deformation, elastic, plastic, spring, surface, roughness, lubrication, streamlined, force meter

#### SC-KS3-C126 — Force measurement
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 1 | Teaching weight: 1 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding that forces are measured in newtons

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce the newton (N) as the SI unit of force. Use force meters (newton meters/spring balances) to measure forces practically: the weight of objects, the force needed to pull an object across a surface (friction), the force needed to stretch a spring. Read force meters accurately. Compare with everyday units — a medium apple weighs approximately 1 N. Discuss how force meters work (a spring extends proportionally to the force applied). Connect to weight (SC-KS3-C167) and Hooke's Law (SC-KS3-C127).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often confuse mass (measured in kilograms) with weight (measured in newtons) — mass is the amount of matter, weight is the gravitational force on that mass. Students may think force meters measure mass — they measure force (weight) in newtons.

**Key vocabulary:** newton, N, force, measurement, force meter, newton meter, spring balance, scale, reading, calibration, weight, unit, SI unit, spring, extension

#### SC-KS3-C127 — Hooke's Law
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding the linear relationship between force and extension (Hooke's Law)

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate Hooke's Law practically: hang increasing masses from a spring and measure the extension. Plot a graph of force (y-axis) against extension (x-axis) — the straight-line portion shows the linear relationship (F = k × e, where k is the spring constant). Identify the limit of proportionality where the line begins to curve. Calculate the spring constant from the gradient. Discuss applications: spring scales, car suspensions, mattresses. Connect to work done and elastic potential energy (SC-KS3-C128).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think Hooke's Law applies to all extensions — it only applies up to the limit of proportionality; beyond this point, the spring deforms permanently. Students may confuse extension with total length — extension is the increase in length from the natural (unstretched) length.

**Key vocabulary:** Hooke's Law, force, extension, spring constant, proportional, linear, limit of proportionality, elastic, graph, gradient, F = k × e, newtons per metre, spring, deformation, load

#### SC-KS3-C128 — Work and deformation
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding work done and energy changes when objects are deformed

**Teaching guidance:** Explain that when a force deforms an object (stretching, compressing, bending), work is done on the object, and energy is transferred to the elastic potential energy store. If the deformation is within the elastic limit, this energy is recoverable — a stretched spring returns to its original shape and the stored energy is released. Calculate work done using W = F × d. For springs, the energy stored equals the area under the force-extension graph (a triangle for the linear region: E = ½ × F × e). Connect to Hooke's Law (SC-KS3-C127) and energy conservation (SC-KS3-C115).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think work is only done when an object moves — work is done whenever a force causes a displacement, including stretching or compressing. Students may confuse the energy stored in a spring with the force applied — energy depends on both force and extension (E = ½Fe).

**Key vocabulary:** work done, energy, elastic potential energy, deformation, force, distance, joule, W = F × d, spring, elastic limit, stored energy, recoverable, irreversible, area under graph

#### SC-KS3-C129 — Non-contact forces
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Knowledge of gravity, magnetic, and electrostatic forces acting at a distance

**Teaching guidance:** Distinguish non-contact forces from contact forces: non-contact forces act at a distance without physical touching. The three main types are gravity (acts on all objects with mass), magnetic forces (act on magnetic materials and between magnets), and electrostatic forces (act between charged objects). Demonstrate each: drop an object (gravity), attract a paperclip with a magnet (magnetic), pick up small paper pieces with a charged balloon (electrostatic). Discuss how non-contact forces can be both attractive and repulsive (magnetic and electrostatic) while gravity is always attractive. Connect to force diagrams.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think forces can only act through direct contact — non-contact forces act through fields that extend through space. Students may think gravity only acts downwards — gravity acts between all objects with mass, pulling them towards each other; 'down' means towards the centre of the Earth.

**Key vocabulary:** non-contact force, gravity, magnetic force, electrostatic force, attraction, repulsion, at a distance, field, gravitational field, magnetic field, electric field, weight, mass, charge, pole

#### SC-KS3-C130 — Atmospheric pressure
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding atmospheric pressure and its variation with height

**Teaching guidance:** Explain atmospheric pressure as the weight of the column of air above a surface pressing down. Demonstrate using a collapsing can (heat air inside a can, seal it, then cool it — the can crushes as external atmospheric pressure exceeds the reduced internal pressure). Discuss why atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude — less air above means less weight pressing down. Use data from different altitudes to illustrate. Connect to weather (high and low pressure systems) and to boiling point (water boils at a lower temperature at high altitude because atmospheric pressure is lower). Connect to gas pressure (SC-KS3-C070).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think atmospheric pressure only acts downwards — it acts in all directions equally. Students may also think there is no air pressure inside buildings — atmospheric pressure acts everywhere at the Earth's surface, indoors and outdoors.

**Key vocabulary:** atmospheric pressure, air pressure, column of air, altitude, weight, atmosphere, pascal, bar, barometer, weather, high pressure, low pressure, decreasing, height, vacuum, crushing can

#### SC-KS3-C131 — Liquid pressure
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding pressure in liquids, upthrust, floating, and sinking

**Teaching guidance:** Explain that pressure in a liquid increases with depth (because more liquid is above pressing down) and is transmitted equally in all directions at the same depth. Demonstrate using a container with holes at different heights — water squirts further from the lower holes because the pressure is greater. Introduce upthrust (buoyancy): when an object is submerged, the pressure on the bottom is greater than on the top, creating a net upward force. An object floats when upthrust equals weight, sinks when weight exceeds upthrust. Connect to density: floating objects are less dense than the liquid. Use Archimedes' principle qualitatively.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think objects float because they are light — floating depends on density (mass per unit volume), not just mass. A heavy steel ship floats because its average density (including air space) is less than water. Students may also think upthrust only acts on floating objects — upthrust acts on all submerged or partially submerged objects.

**Key vocabulary:** liquid pressure, depth, upthrust, buoyancy, Archimedes' principle, floating, sinking, density, weight, displaced, displacement, hydraulic, pressure, pascal, fluid, submersion

#### SC-KS3-C132 — Pressure calculation
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding pressure as force per unit area

**Teaching guidance:** Define pressure as force per unit area: P = F/A, measured in pascals (Pa), where 1 Pa = 1 N/m². Demonstrate the effect of area: press a thumb tack point-first into a board (small area = high pressure) versus flat-side (large area = low pressure). Calculate pressure in practical contexts: the pressure exerted by a person standing on one foot versus two feet, the pressure under a stiletto heel versus a flat shoe. Use real-world applications: snowshoes distribute weight over a large area, knife blades concentrate force on a small area. Connect to liquid pressure (SC-KS3-C131) and atmospheric pressure (SC-KS3-C130).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often confuse pressure with force — a large force can produce a small pressure if spread over a large area. Students may think pressure only acts on surfaces — pressure acts within fluids (liquids and gases) as well. Students sometimes forget to convert area units (cm² to m²) when calculating pressure.

**Key vocabulary:** pressure, force, area, pascal, Pa, P = F/A, newtons per square metre, concentrated, distributed, surface area, contact area, unit, calculation, comparison

#### SC-KS3-C133 — Equilibrium
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding equilibrium with opposing forces

**Teaching guidance:** Define equilibrium as the state where all forces (or moments) acting on an object are balanced, resulting in no change in motion. Revisit balanced forces (SC-KS3-C123): an object in equilibrium is either stationary or moving at constant velocity. Extend to rotational equilibrium using the principle of moments (SC-KS3-C124). Demonstrate: a book on a table, a parachutist at terminal velocity, a balanced seesaw. Discuss how equilibrium is a key concept in engineering — bridges, buildings, and structures must be in equilibrium to stand. Have pupils analyse real-world scenarios to identify forces in equilibrium.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think equilibrium means 'not moving' — an object moving at constant velocity with balanced forces is also in equilibrium. Students may think objects in equilibrium have no forces acting on them — equilibrium means forces are balanced, not absent.

**Key vocabulary:** equilibrium, balanced, force, moment, resultant, zero, stationary, constant velocity, stable, unstable, neutral, terminal velocity, structural, engineering, Newton's first law

#### SC-KS3-C134 — Forces and motion
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding that forces cause changes in motion

**Teaching guidance:** Demonstrate Newton's first and second laws: an object at rest stays at rest unless an unbalanced force acts (push a stationary trolley), and the acceleration of an object is proportional to the resultant force and inversely proportional to its mass (F = ma). Use a trolley on a smooth runway with different masses and forces to investigate the relationship. Plot graphs of acceleration vs force (at constant mass) and acceleration vs mass (at constant force). Discuss real-world applications: seatbelts (stopping forces), rocket propulsion (force causes acceleration). Connect to balanced and unbalanced forces (SC-KS3-C123).

**Common misconceptions:** Students persistently believe that a constant force produces a constant speed — a constant resultant force produces constant acceleration (continuously increasing speed). Students also think objects slow down naturally without a force — objects only decelerate when an opposing force (friction, air resistance) acts on them.

**Key vocabulary:** force, motion, acceleration, deceleration, Newton's first law, Newton's second law, resultant force, mass, inertia, F = ma, change in velocity, stationary, constant velocity, friction

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS3-D012-CL001:**
- **Energy and Matter** (primary): Where does the energy come from, where does it go, and is anything conserved?
  Why: Energy clusters require pupils to trace where energy comes from, how it is transferred or transformed, and where it ends up — conservation and flow are the central ideas.
  AI instruction: Use the ENERGY AND MATTER lens: prompt pupils to trace energy pathways, identify transformations between energy forms, track matter through cycles, and apply conservation thinking. Useful questions: 'Where did the energy come from?', 'What happened to it?', 'Is anything created or destroyed?', 'Can you draw the energy flow?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Physical phenomena (shadows, circuits, forces) involve clear causal chains: changing one variable produces a predictable effect, making cause-and-effect reasoning the investigative frame.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

**SC-KS3-D012-CL003:**
- **Cause and Effect** (primary): What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Fair testing and investigations are designed to isolate variables and establish causal relationships — the cognitive demand is reasoning from controlled evidence to causal claims.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Data from repeated investigations reveals patterns that allow pupils to generalise their findings beyond the specific test conditions.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**SC-KS3-D012-CL005:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Material properties link physical structure (molecular arrangement, surface texture) to functional behaviour (waterproofing, strength, flexibility) — the key question is always 'why does this material behave this way?'
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Properties can be sorted and classified into patterns (metals conduct, insulators don't), allowing pupils to make predictions about unfamiliar materials.

## Domain: SC-KS3-D013 — Physics - Waves
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS3 | **Age:** 11-14 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Waves at KS3 provides pupils with a unified understanding of the behaviour of waves — including sound waves and light — in terms of wavelength, frequency, amplitude and speed. Pupils understand waves as the mechanism by which energy is transferred without the bulk movement of matter, and investigate the properties of waves including reflection, refraction, diffraction and absorption. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to understand the electromagnetic spectrum as a family of waves of different frequencies, and to know the properties and uses of each region from radio waves to gamma rays. Pupils also study the structure of the ear and eye, connecting wave physics to human sensory biology.

### Concepts (12)

#### SC-KS3-C135 — Water waves
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding waves on water as transverse undulations that can reflect and superpose

**Teaching guidance:** Demonstrate water waves in a ripple tank: show how waves travel outward from a disturbance as transverse undulations (the water moves up and down while the wave travels horizontally). Show reflection from a barrier and superposition (constructive and destructive interference when two waves meet). Use a slinky spring to model transverse waves more clearly — shake one end side to side and observe the wave pattern. Identify wave features: crest, trough, wavelength, amplitude. Connect to the general properties of waves and energy transfer (SC-KS3-C140).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think water waves carry water from one place to another — waves transfer energy, not matter. A floating cork bobs up and down as waves pass but does not travel with the wave. Students may also think all waves are transverse — sound waves are longitudinal.

**Key vocabulary:** water wave, transverse wave, undulation, ripple tank, reflection, superposition, crest, trough, wavelength, amplitude, frequency, wave speed, disturbance, medium, surface wave

#### SC-KS3-C136 — Sound frequency
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding sound wave frequencies measured in hertz

**Teaching guidance:** Explain that sound waves have a frequency measured in hertz (Hz): 1 Hz means one complete vibration per second. Higher frequency means a higher pitch. Demonstrate using a signal generator and speaker to produce sounds of different frequencies. Use an oscilloscope or data logger with a microphone to visualise sound waves and measure frequency. Connect to musical instruments: shorter strings vibrate faster (higher frequency = higher pitch). Investigate the relationship between frequency and pitch using tuning forks. The range of human hearing is approximately 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often confuse pitch with loudness — pitch is determined by frequency, loudness by amplitude. A high-pitched sound is not necessarily loud, and a loud sound is not necessarily high-pitched. Students may also think frequency is the same as wavelength — they are inversely related (higher frequency = shorter wavelength).

**Key vocabulary:** sound wave, frequency, hertz, Hz, pitch, high frequency, low frequency, vibration, oscillation, oscilloscope, signal generator, tuning fork, kilohertz, ultrasound, infrasound

#### SC-KS3-C137 — Sound properties
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Knowledge of echoes, reflection, absorption, and the need for a medium for sound

**Teaching guidance:** Demonstrate echoes using two flat boards and a ticking clock (sound reflects off the boards). Explain that sound reflects off hard surfaces (echoes) and is absorbed by soft surfaces (soundproofing). Demonstrate that sound cannot travel through a vacuum using a bell jar and vacuum pump — as air is removed, the bell becomes inaudible. Investigate the absorption of sound by different materials. Discuss real-world applications: sonar uses echoes to measure depth, ultrasound uses reflections for medical imaging, concert halls are designed to control reflections.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think sound can travel through a vacuum (like in space movies) — sound requires a medium (solid, liquid, or gas) because it is transmitted by particle vibrations. Students may also think echoes are separate sounds — an echo is the same sound wave reflected back from a surface.

**Key vocabulary:** echo, reflection, absorption, medium, vacuum, speed of sound, sound wave, vibration, solid, liquid, gas, sonar, ultrasound, soundproofing, reverberation, transmission

#### SC-KS3-C138 — Sound production
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding that sound is produced by vibrations and is a longitudinal wave

**Teaching guidance:** Demonstrate that sound is produced by vibrations: touch a vibrating tuning fork to water (splashes occur), hold a vibrating ruler over the edge of a desk (audible buzz), feel the vibrations of a speaker cone. Explain that sound is a longitudinal wave: particles vibrate back and forth in the same direction as the wave travels, creating compressions (particles close together) and rarefactions (particles spread apart). Model with a slinky spring pushed back and forth along its length. Compare with transverse waves (SC-KS3-C135). Connect to the need for a medium (SC-KS3-C137).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think sound is a transverse wave because it is often drawn as a sine wave — the sine wave represents the pattern of compressions and rarefactions, but sound is actually a longitudinal wave with particles vibrating parallel to the direction of travel. Students may also think that louder sounds travel faster — all sounds travel at the same speed in the same medium regardless of loudness.

**Key vocabulary:** sound, vibration, longitudinal wave, compression, rarefaction, oscillation, particle, medium, wave, frequency, amplitude, loudness, pitch, speaker, tuning fork, slinky

#### SC-KS3-C139 — Auditory range
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 1 | Teaching weight: 1

Knowledge of the hearing ranges of humans and animals

**Teaching guidance:** Discuss the range of frequencies that humans can hear (approximately 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz) and compare with other animals: dogs can hear up to about 65,000 Hz, bats use echolocation at frequencies up to 100,000 Hz, elephants can hear infrasound below 20 Hz. Sounds above 20,000 Hz are ultrasound, sounds below 20 Hz are infrasound. Discuss how hearing range changes with age — many adults cannot hear above 15,000 Hz. Investigate hearing range using a signal generator (take care with high volumes). Connect to uses of ultrasound (medical imaging, cleaning, sonar).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think humans have the best hearing — many animals can hear frequencies far outside the human range. Students may also think ultrasound is dangerous because it is 'ultra' — ultrasound is routinely used safely in medical imaging (pregnancy scans). Students sometimes confuse loudness with pitch when discussing hearing range — the range refers to frequency (pitch), not loudness.

**Key vocabulary:** auditory range, hearing range, frequency, hertz, ultrasound, infrasound, human ear, animal hearing, echolocation, bat, dog, elephant, cochlea, decibel, hearing loss

#### SC-KS3-C140 — Waves transfer energy **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 3

Understanding that waves transfer energy and information

**Teaching guidance:** Establish the fundamental concept that waves transfer energy from one place to another without transferring matter. Demonstrate: water waves can push a ball on the surface (energy transferred) but the water itself does not travel horizontally. Sound waves transfer energy from a speaker to an ear (causing the eardrum to vibrate). Light waves transfer energy from the Sun to Earth. Electromagnetic waves also carry information (radio, WiFi, mobile phone signals). Connect to all wave types studied. Emphasise that this is a unifying concept for all waves.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think waves carry matter along with energy — demonstrate with a slinky or rope wave that individual parts of the medium return to their original position after the wave passes. Students may also think that bigger waves carry more information — amplitude relates to energy, not information content.

**Key vocabulary:** wave, energy transfer, information, medium, electromagnetic wave, mechanical wave, sound, light, radio wave, vibration, oscillation, amplitude, intensity, source, receiver

#### SC-KS3-C141 — Light vs matter waves
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding similarities and differences between light waves and waves in matter

**Teaching guidance:** Compare light waves with mechanical waves (water, sound): both have wavelength, frequency, amplitude, and speed, and both can be reflected and refracted. The key difference: light is an electromagnetic wave that can travel through a vacuum (space), while sound and water waves are mechanical waves that require a medium. Light travels much faster than sound (3 × 10⁸ m/s vs ~340 m/s in air). Another difference: light waves are transverse, sound waves are longitudinal. Use the thunderstorm example — you see lightning before you hear thunder because light travels faster.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think light needs a medium to travel — light is an electromagnetic wave and can travel through the vacuum of space. Students may think light and sound travel at the same speed — use the lightning/thunder delay to demonstrate the vast difference in speed.

**Key vocabulary:** light wave, electromagnetic wave, mechanical wave, sound wave, vacuum, medium, speed, transverse, longitudinal, frequency, wavelength, amplitude, reflection, refraction, comparison

#### SC-KS3-C142 — Light properties **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 4

Knowledge that light travels through a vacuum at a specific speed

**Teaching guidance:** Teach that light travels in straight lines through a uniform medium and at a constant speed of approximately 3 × 10⁸ m/s (300,000 km/s) in a vacuum. This is the fastest speed possible in the universe. Demonstrate that light travels in straight lines using a laser and smoke, or by aligning three cards with pinholes. Discuss how we know the speed of light — historical experiments (Rømer, Fizeau) and modern measurements. Connect to the light year as a distance unit (SC-KS3-C171) and to the electromagnetic spectrum.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think light travels instantaneously — while light is extremely fast, it takes time to travel (approximately 8 minutes from the Sun to Earth, over 4 years from the nearest star). Students may also think light slows down permanently when passing through glass — light slows in glass but returns to its original speed when it exits.

**Key vocabulary:** speed of light, vacuum, 3 × 10⁸ m/s, straight line, ray, beam, medium, constant speed, electromagnetic radiation, fastest speed, light year, photon, propagation

#### SC-KS3-C143 — Light transmission
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding absorption, scattering, and reflection of light through materials

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate how light interacts with different materials: transparent materials (glass, clear plastic) transmit most light, translucent materials (frosted glass, tissue paper) scatter light as it passes through, opaque materials (wood, metal) absorb or reflect light. Demonstrate reflection using mirrors and ray boxes. Demonstrate that white surfaces reflect most light and black surfaces absorb most light (connect to heating — black surfaces heat up faster in sunlight). Discuss everyday applications: mirrors, windows, sunglasses, solar panels.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think we see objects because light travels from our eyes to the object — clarify that we see objects because light from a source reflects off the object into our eyes. Students may also think black objects do not interact with light — black objects absorb most light, converting it to thermal energy.

**Key vocabulary:** absorption, reflection, scattering, transmission, transparent, translucent, opaque, mirror, surface, light ray, incident ray, reflected ray, normal line, angle, material

#### SC-KS3-C144 — Ray model of light
Type: skill | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 4 | Fan-out: 1

Using ray model to explain mirrors, refraction, lenses, and the human eye

**Teaching guidance:** Use ray boxes and mirrors to demonstrate the law of reflection: angle of incidence = angle of reflection (measured from the normal). Demonstrate refraction using a glass block and ray box — the ray bends towards the normal when entering a denser medium and away from the normal when leaving. Use lenses to focus light: convex (converging) lenses bring parallel rays to a focal point, concave (diverging) lenses spread rays apart. Model how the human eye works: the cornea and lens focus light onto the retina, the iris controls the amount of light entering. Connect to corrective lenses for short-sight and long-sight.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think light bends because it hits a surface at an angle — refraction is caused by the change in speed when light enters a material of different density. Students may also confuse real and virtual images — a real image can be projected on a screen, a virtual image (in a mirror) cannot.

**Key vocabulary:** ray model, ray diagram, mirror, reflection, law of reflection, refraction, normal, angle of incidence, angle of refraction, lens, convex, concave, focal point, focus, retina, cornea, iris, pupil

#### SC-KS3-C145 — Light effects
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Understanding that light energy can cause chemical and electrical effects

**Teaching guidance:** Discuss two important effects of light energy. Chemical effects: photosynthesis (light energy drives the chemical reaction in chloroplasts), photography (light causes chemical changes in film or electronic changes in a digital sensor), bleaching (UV light breaks down coloured chemicals), sunburn (UV damages DNA in skin cells). Electrical effects: solar cells (photovoltaic cells convert light directly into electricity), LDRs (light-dependent resistors change resistance with light). Demonstrate a solar cell powering a small motor. Connect to energy resources (SC-KS3-C111) and photosynthesis (SC-KS3-C051).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think solar panels and solar cells are the same — solar panels (thermal) heat water, while solar cells (photovoltaic) generate electricity. Students may think light only has chemical effects on plants — light causes chemical changes in many contexts including photography, bleaching, and skin damage.

**Key vocabulary:** light energy, chemical effect, electrical effect, photosynthesis, photovoltaic cell, solar cell, LDR, light-dependent resistor, photography, UV light, bleaching, sunburn, energy conversion, sensor

#### SC-KS3-C146 — Color and frequency
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that colors result from different frequencies of light

**Teaching guidance:** Explain that white light is a mixture of all colours, which can be separated using a prism to form a spectrum (Newton's experiment). The colours of the visible spectrum are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet — in order of decreasing wavelength and increasing frequency. Objects appear coloured because they reflect some wavelengths and absorb others: a red object reflects red light and absorbs all other colours. Demonstrate using colour filters and coloured lights: mixing red, green, and blue light produces white light (additive colour mixing). Connect to the electromagnetic spectrum.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often confuse mixing coloured light (additive — red + green = yellow) with mixing paints (subtractive — red + green = brown). Students may also think colour is a property of the object rather than a property of the reflected light — a red object is not inherently red; it appears red because it reflects red wavelengths.

**Key vocabulary:** colour, frequency, wavelength, visible spectrum, prism, white light, dispersion, red, violet, absorption, reflection, filter, additive colour mixing, primary colours of light, RGB, pigment

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS3-D013-CL001:**
- **Evidence and Argument** (primary): What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: This cluster asks pupils to gather, record or communicate scientific findings — the core cognitive demand is evaluating what counts as valid evidence and how to present it clearly.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Scientific observations and enquiry serve to establish causal relationships; framing questions around 'what causes X' gives purpose to the observation work.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

**SC-KS3-D013-CL002:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Material properties link physical structure (molecular arrangement, surface texture) to functional behaviour (waterproofing, strength, flexibility) — the key question is always 'why does this material behave this way?'
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Properties can be sorted and classified into patterns (metals conduct, insulators don't), allowing pupils to make predictions about unfamiliar materials.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**SC-KS3-D013-CL003:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**SC-KS3-D013-CL004:**
- **Energy and Matter** (primary): Where does the energy come from, where does it go, and is anything conserved?
  Why: Energy clusters require pupils to trace where energy comes from, how it is transferred or transformed, and where it ends up — conservation and flow are the central ideas.
  AI instruction: Use the ENERGY AND MATTER lens: prompt pupils to trace energy pathways, identify transformations between energy forms, track matter through cycles, and apply conservation thinking. Useful questions: 'Where did the energy come from?', 'What happened to it?', 'Is anything created or destroyed?', 'Can you draw the energy flow?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Physical phenomena (shadows, circuits, forces) involve clear causal chains: changing one variable produces a predictable effect, making cause-and-effect reasoning the investigative frame.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

## Domain: SC-KS3-D014 — Physics - Electricity and Electromagnetism
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS3 | **Age:** 11-14 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Electricity and electromagnetism at KS3 extends the simple circuit work of primary science to a quantitative understanding of electrical quantities and their relationships. Pupils are introduced to voltage, current and resistance as the key variables in electrical circuits, and learn to apply Ohm's law and the rules for current and voltage in series and parallel circuits. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to understand magnetic fields, the relationship between electricity and magnetism, and the principles of the electric motor and electromagnetic induction. These concepts underpin the technology of generators, motors and electrical devices that are central to modern life, and are extended to alternating current and electrical power at GCSE.

### Concepts (11)

#### SC-KS3-C147 — Electric current **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 8

Understanding electric current as flow of charge measured in amperes

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce electric current as the flow of electric charge around a circuit. Charge is measured in coulombs (C), current is measured in amperes (A) — 1 ampere is 1 coulomb of charge flowing per second (I = Q/t). Demonstrate using a simple circuit with a battery, lamp, and ammeter. Discuss the conventional current direction (positive to negative) versus electron flow (negative to positive). Use the water flow analogy: current is like the rate of water flow, the battery is like a pump. Connect to potential difference (SC-KS3-C149) and resistance (SC-KS3-C150).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think current is used up as it goes around a circuit — current is the same at all points in a series circuit. Students may also think that a battery stores current or electricity — a battery stores chemical energy and converts it to electrical energy, creating a potential difference that drives current.

**Key vocabulary:** electric current, charge, coulomb, ampere, amp, flow, circuit, ammeter, battery, cell, wire, conductor, conventional current, electron flow, I = Q/t, rate of flow

#### SC-KS3-C148 — Circuit types
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Knowledge of series and parallel circuits and current behavior

**Teaching guidance:** Build series and parallel circuits and use ammeters and voltmeters to investigate current and voltage behaviour. In series circuits: current is the same at every point; voltage is shared between components. In parallel circuits: voltage is the same across each branch; current splits at junctions (total current into a junction equals total current out). Use practical circuit building with real components. Draw circuit diagrams using standard symbols. Compare the brightness of identical lamps in series versus parallel circuits. Connect to resistance (SC-KS3-C150).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think current is shared equally in a parallel circuit regardless of resistance — current splits in inverse proportion to resistance. Students may also think that adding more lamps in parallel makes all lamps dimmer — in parallel, each lamp receives the full voltage and brightness is unchanged (though total current from the battery increases).

**Key vocabulary:** series circuit, parallel circuit, branch, junction, current, voltage, ammeter, voltmeter, circuit diagram, symbol, cell, battery, lamp, switch, resistor, split, shared

#### SC-KS3-C149 — Potential difference
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding potential difference measured in volts

**Teaching guidance:** Define potential difference (voltage) as the energy transferred per unit of charge: V = E/Q, measured in volts (V). 1 volt means 1 joule of energy per coulomb of charge. Use the water analogy: voltage is like the height difference that drives water flow — a battery is like a pump raising water (giving charge energy). Measure voltage using a voltmeter connected in parallel across a component. Investigate how voltage is distributed across components in series and parallel circuits. Connect to current (SC-KS3-C147) and resistance (SC-KS3-C150).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often confuse voltage and current — voltage is the energy per unit charge (the 'push'), current is the rate of charge flow. Students may also connect voltmeters in series instead of parallel — voltmeters must be connected across (in parallel with) the component being measured.

**Key vocabulary:** potential difference, voltage, volt, V, energy, charge, coulomb, joule, V = E/Q, voltmeter, parallel, battery, cell, component, energy transfer, electromotive force

#### SC-KS3-C150 — Resistance
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding resistance as the ratio of voltage to current

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce resistance as the opposition to current flow, measured in ohms (Ω). Use Ohm's law: V = IR (voltage = current × resistance), so R = V/I. Investigate how resistance affects current: add resistors to a circuit and measure the change in current using an ammeter. Demonstrate that longer wires have more resistance, thinner wires have more resistance, and higher temperature increases resistance in metals. Discuss practical resistors, variable resistors (rheostats), and how thermistors and LDRs change resistance with conditions. Connect to circuit calculations.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think resistance only exists in labelled resistors — all components in a circuit (wires, lamps, motors) have resistance. Students may also think that increasing resistance always reduces brightness — it reduces current, which reduces brightness, but the relationship is not always intuitive in parallel circuits.

**Key vocabulary:** resistance, ohm, Ω, Ohm's law, V = IR, current, voltage, conductor, resistor, variable resistor, rheostat, thermistor, LDR, wire, length, thickness, temperature, opposition

#### SC-KS3-C151 — Conductors and insulators
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Understanding differences in resistance between conducting and insulating materials

**Teaching guidance:** Test different materials for electrical conductivity using a simple circuit with a gap and a lamp — if the lamp lights, the material is a conductor; if not, it is an insulator. Classify common materials: metals (copper, aluminium, iron) are good conductors; plastics, rubber, glass, and wood are insulators. Discuss why metals conduct — free electrons that can carry charge. Explain why wires have copper cores (good conductor) surrounded by plastic insulation (prevents short circuits and electric shocks). Introduce semiconductors (silicon) as materials with intermediate conductivity.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think all metals conduct equally well — copper and silver are excellent conductors, but iron has much higher resistance. Students may also think water is a good conductor — pure water is an insulator; it is the dissolved ions (in tap water or salt water) that allow conduction.

**Key vocabulary:** conductor, insulator, semiconductor, resistance, conductivity, free electron, metal, copper, plastic, rubber, silicon, electrical safety, insulation, short circuit, earthing

#### SC-KS3-C152 — Static electricity
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding charge separation through friction and forces between charged objects

**Teaching guidance:** Demonstrate static electricity by rubbing a balloon on hair (balloon becomes negatively charged, hair becomes positively charged and stands up), or rubbing a polythene rod with a cloth (rod becomes negatively charged). Explain using the electron transfer model: friction transfers electrons from one material to another — the material gaining electrons becomes negative, the material losing electrons becomes positive. Demonstrate forces between charged objects: like charges repel, unlike charges attract. Use a Van de Graaff generator for dramatic demonstrations. Connect to electric fields (SC-KS3-C153).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think rubbing creates charge — charge is not created; it is transferred from one object to another (conservation of charge). Students may also think protons move — in solid materials, only electrons move; protons are fixed in the nucleus.

**Key vocabulary:** static electricity, charge, electron, proton, positive, negative, friction, transfer, attraction, repulsion, like charges, unlike charges, Van de Graaff, discharge, spark, earthing, insulator

#### SC-KS3-C153 — Electric fields
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding electric fields as regions where forces act without contact

**Teaching guidance:** Explain that charged objects create an electric field around them — a region where other charged objects experience a force without contact. Compare with gravitational fields (act on mass) and magnetic fields (act on magnetic materials). Electric field lines point from positive to negative. Demonstrate using a charged object affecting another charged object at a distance. Discuss how electric fields are used in technology: inkjet printers, electrostatic precipitators (pollution control), photocopiers. Connect to static electricity (SC-KS3-C152) and non-contact forces (SC-KS3-C129).

**Common misconceptions:** Students may think electric fields are the same as electric current — a field exists around any charged object whether or not charges are flowing. Students sometimes think fields are physical things you can see or touch — fields are a model to explain forces that act at a distance.

**Key vocabulary:** electric field, field lines, charge, force, non-contact, region, positive, negative, attraction, repulsion, strength, distance, field pattern, point charge, uniform field

#### SC-KS3-C154 — Magnetic poles
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 1 | Teaching weight: 1 | Fan-out: 1

Knowledge of magnetic poles and attraction/repulsion

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate magnets using bar magnets and plotting compasses: identify north and south poles, demonstrate that like poles repel and unlike poles attract, and show that the attraction/repulsion force increases as magnets are brought closer together. Test which materials are magnetic (iron, cobalt, nickel, and some steels) — most materials are non-magnetic. Demonstrate that every magnet has two poles and that cutting a magnet in half produces two smaller magnets, each with two poles. Connect to magnetic fields (SC-KS3-C155).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think all metals are magnetic — only iron, cobalt, and nickel (and their alloys) are magnetic; aluminium, copper, and gold are not. Students may also think you can have an isolated north or south pole (a monopole) — all magnets have both a north and a south pole.

**Key vocabulary:** magnet, magnetic, north pole, south pole, attract, repel, magnetic material, iron, cobalt, nickel, steel, non-magnetic, pole, bar magnet, horseshoe magnet, permanent magnet

#### SC-KS3-C155 — Magnetic fields **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 3

Understanding magnetic fields and their representation with field lines

**Teaching guidance:** Use iron filings sprinkled around a bar magnet on paper to reveal the magnetic field pattern: lines emerge from the north pole and curve around to the south pole. Use plotting compasses to trace individual field lines and determine their direction. Draw magnetic field diagrams showing the field around a single bar magnet and between two magnets (attraction and repulsion patterns). Explain that field lines are closer together where the field is stronger (near the poles). Connect to the Earth's magnetic field (SC-KS3-C156) and electromagnetism (SC-KS3-C157).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think magnetic field lines are real physical things — they are a model to represent the direction and strength of the magnetic force. Students may also think the magnetic field stops at the edge of the iron filings pattern — the field extends to infinity but gets weaker with distance.

**Key vocabulary:** magnetic field, field lines, iron filings, plotting compass, north pole, south pole, strength, direction, density, pattern, attraction, repulsion, uniform field, non-uniform field

#### SC-KS3-C156 — Earth's magnetism

Knowledge of Earth's magnetic field and its use in navigation

**Teaching guidance:** Explain that the Earth behaves as though it has a giant bar magnet inside it, creating a magnetic field that extends into space. The geographic North Pole is near the magnetic south pole (this is why the north pole of a compass needle points north — it is attracted to the Earth's magnetic south pole). Demonstrate using a compass: the needle always aligns with the Earth's magnetic field, pointing approximately north-south. Discuss how compasses have been used for navigation for centuries. Mention that the Earth's magnetic field protects us from harmful solar radiation (charged particles from the Sun).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think the Earth's geographic North Pole is a magnetic north pole — it is actually near a magnetic south pole (which is why north-seeking compass needles point towards it). Students may also think the magnetic poles are exactly at the geographic poles — they are offset by several degrees (magnetic declination).

**Key vocabulary:** Earth's magnetic field, geographic pole, magnetic pole, compass, navigation, magnetic declination, magnetosphere, solar wind, aurora, core, iron, field direction, protection

#### SC-KS3-C157 — Electromagnetism
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding the magnetic effect of electric current and basic principles of motors

**Teaching guidance:** Demonstrate the magnetic effect of an electric current: wrap insulated wire around an iron nail and connect to a battery — the nail becomes an electromagnet that attracts paperclips. Compare with a permanent magnet. Investigate factors affecting electromagnet strength: number of coils, current, and presence of an iron core. Explain how the magnetic field around a current-carrying wire can be shown using a compass or iron filings. Introduce the basic principle of an electric motor: a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field experiences a force (the motor effect). Demonstrate a simple motor. Connect to practical applications: doorbells, electric motors, maglev trains.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think electromagnets and permanent magnets work by completely different mechanisms — both produce magnetic fields, but an electromagnet's field is produced by electric current and can be switched on and off. Students may also think electric motors use permanent magnets only — motors use the interaction between a current-carrying coil and a magnetic field.

**Key vocabulary:** electromagnet, current, magnetic field, coil, solenoid, iron core, motor effect, electric motor, force, wire, permanent magnet, electromagnetic induction, generator, relay, strength, turns

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS3-D014-CL001:**
- **Energy and Matter** (primary): Where does the energy come from, where does it go, and is anything conserved?
  Why: Energy clusters require pupils to trace where energy comes from, how it is transferred or transformed, and where it ends up — conservation and flow are the central ideas.
  AI instruction: Use the ENERGY AND MATTER lens: prompt pupils to trace energy pathways, identify transformations between energy forms, track matter through cycles, and apply conservation thinking. Useful questions: 'Where did the energy come from?', 'What happened to it?', 'Is anything created or destroyed?', 'Can you draw the energy flow?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Physical phenomena (shadows, circuits, forces) involve clear causal chains: changing one variable produces a predictable effect, making cause-and-effect reasoning the investigative frame.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

## Domain: SC-KS3-D015 — Physics - Matter
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS3 | **Age:** 11-14 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Matter at KS3 builds on the particle model introduced in the Particulate Nature of Matter domain to explore the physical properties of materials in more detail, including density, pressure and the behaviour of matter under different conditions. Pupils investigate the factors that affect density, understand pressure as force per unit area, and apply this to explain atmospheric pressure, pressure in liquids and the behaviour of gases. The statutory curriculum also includes study of motion and forces in the context of floating and sinking, using Archimedes' principle to explain upthrust. This domain connects the abstract particle model to measurable, observable physical phenomena.

### Concepts (9)

#### SC-KS3-C158 — Physical changes
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Understanding conservation of mass and reversibility in physical changes

**Teaching guidance:** Demonstrate conservation of mass in physical changes: weigh ice before and after melting, weigh water before and after dissolving salt, weigh a sealed flask before and after evaporation. In each case, the mass is unchanged because no atoms are created or destroyed. Discuss reversibility: physical changes (melting, dissolving, evaporating) can be reversed; the original substance can be recovered. Compare with chemical changes (SC-KS3-C162) where new substances are formed and the change is usually irreversible. Connect to conservation of mass in chemical reactions (SC-KS3-C075).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think mass is lost when water evaporates — the water molecules have moved into the air as water vapour; the total mass of the system is unchanged. Students may also think dissolving is a chemical change — dissolving is a physical change because the dissolved substance can be recovered by evaporation.

**Key vocabulary:** physical change, conservation of mass, reversible, irreversible, melting, freezing, dissolving, evaporation, condensation, mass, balance, substance, recover, state change, mixture

#### SC-KS3-C159 — States properties
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Knowledge of similarities and differences between solid, liquid, and gas states including density

**Teaching guidance:** Compare the properties of solids, liquids, and gases side by side in a table: shape (fixed/takes container shape/fills container), volume (fixed/fixed/fills container), compressibility (incompressible/almost incompressible/easily compressed), density (generally high/medium/low), flow (no/yes/yes). Introduce density as mass per unit volume (ρ = m/V) and measure the density of regular and irregular objects practically using balances and measuring cylinders. Compare densities of common materials. Connect to the particle model (SC-KS3-C068) for explanations.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think density is the same as weight or heaviness — a small piece of lead is denser than a large piece of wood, even though the wood may weigh more. Students may also think all solids are denser than all liquids — ice floats on water, and many liquids (mercury) are denser than many solids (aluminium).

**Key vocabulary:** solid, liquid, gas, state of matter, property, shape, volume, compressibility, density, mass, volume, ρ = m/V, flow, particle arrangement, comparison, measurement, displacement method

#### SC-KS3-C160 — Brownian motion
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding Brownian motion as evidence for particle movement in gases

**Teaching guidance:** Describe Brownian motion: Robert Brown observed pollen grains jiggling randomly in water under a microscope in 1827. Einstein explained this in 1905 as evidence that invisible water molecules were constantly colliding with the larger pollen grains, pushing them in random directions. Use a smoke cell under a microscope to observe smoke particles exhibiting random motion due to collisions with air molecules. Connect to the particle model of matter — this provides direct evidence that gases and liquids are made of moving particles. Discuss how temperature affects the speed of motion.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think the jiggling particles are the molecules themselves — clarify that we observe larger particles (pollen, smoke) being pushed around by invisible molecules colliding with them. Students may also think Brownian motion only occurs in liquids — it occurs in both liquids and gases.

**Key vocabulary:** Brownian motion, Robert Brown, Albert Einstein, random motion, pollen grain, smoke particle, collision, particle model, evidence, molecule, microscope, kinetic energy, air molecule, observation

#### SC-KS3-C161 — Diffusion driven by concentration
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding diffusion in liquids and gases as driven by concentration differences

**Teaching guidance:** Demonstrate diffusion in liquids using potassium permanganate crystals in water (colour spreads from concentrated to dilute) and in gases using a perfume spray or ammonia and hydrochloric acid forming a white ring in a glass tube. Explain that diffusion is driven by the random motion of particles — in a region of high concentration, more particles move out than move in, creating a net movement towards lower concentration. The process continues until the concentration is uniform. Discuss factors affecting rate: temperature (faster particles = faster diffusion), molecular mass (lighter particles diffuse faster). Connect to SC-KS3-C030 (biological diffusion) and SC-KS3-C078.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think particles deliberately move from high to low concentration — individual particles move randomly; the net effect of many random movements is movement from high to low concentration. Students may think diffusion stops once concentrations are equal — particles continue to move randomly, but there is no net movement in any direction (dynamic equilibrium).

**Key vocabulary:** diffusion, concentration, concentration gradient, random motion, net movement, particle, gas, liquid, rate, temperature, molecular mass, equilibrium, uniform, spread, ammonia, hydrochloric acid

#### SC-KS3-C162 — Chemical vs physical changes
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Understanding the difference between chemical and physical changes

**Teaching guidance:** Compare chemical and physical changes using practical examples. Physical changes: ice melting (H₂O stays H₂O), sugar dissolving (sugar can be recovered), stretching a rubber band. Chemical changes: burning magnesium (Mg becomes MgO), rusting iron (Fe becomes iron oxide), cooking an egg (proteins denature permanently). Key distinction: in a chemical change, new substances with new properties are formed; in a physical change, the substance stays the same. Connect to conservation of mass (SC-KS3-C075) — mass is conserved in both types of change.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think any change involving heat is a chemical change — melting (physical) and evaporation (physical) both involve heating but are not chemical changes. Students may also think all chemical changes are irreversible — some chemical reactions are reversible (e.g., hydrating and dehydrating copper sulfate).

**Key vocabulary:** chemical change, physical change, new substance, property, reversible, irreversible, burning, rusting, cooking, dissolving, melting, evidence, colour change, gas produced, temperature change, precipitate

#### SC-KS3-C163 — Particle arrangements **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 4 | Fan-out: 4

Understanding how particle arrangements and motion explain properties of states

**Teaching guidance:** Use particle diagrams and animations to explain how particle arrangement and motion account for the properties of the three states of matter. Solids: particles in a regular arrangement, vibrating about fixed positions — explains fixed shape and volume. Liquids: particles close together but arranged irregularly, able to slide past each other — explains ability to flow and take the shape of the container. Gases: particles widely spaced, moving rapidly in random directions — explains ability to fill a container and be compressed. Connect to changes of state (SC-KS3-C071) and density (SC-KS3-C159).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often draw particles of different sizes for different states — the particles are the same in each state; it is their arrangement, spacing, and motion that differ. Students may also think particles in a solid do not move — they vibrate about fixed positions but do not move from place to place.

**Key vocabulary:** particle arrangement, motion, solid, liquid, gas, vibrate, slide, random, spacing, regular, irregular, fixed position, flow, compress, kinetic energy, intermolecular force, state of matter

#### SC-KS3-C164 — Atoms and molecules
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Understanding atoms and molecules as particles

**Teaching guidance:** Clarify the distinction between atoms and molecules: an atom is the smallest particle of an element, while a molecule is two or more atoms bonded together. Molecules can be elements (O₂, N₂, H₂) or compounds (H₂O, CO₂, CH₄). Use molecular model kits to build simple molecules and show how atoms are connected. Discuss that when scientists refer to 'particles' in the particle model, they mean atoms or molecules depending on the substance. For example, in noble gases (He, Ne), the particles are individual atoms; in water, the particles are molecules of H₂O.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often use 'atoms' and 'molecules' interchangeably — clarify that a molecule consists of two or more atoms bonded together, while an atom is a single particle of an element. Students may also think all elements exist as individual atoms — many gaseous elements exist as diatomic molecules (H₂, O₂, N₂, F₂, Cl₂).

**Key vocabulary:** atom, molecule, element, compound, bond, particle, chemical formula, diatomic, monatomic, molecular model, substance, noble gas, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, water

#### SC-KS3-C165 — Temperature and particles **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 3

Understanding how temperature affects particle motion and spacing

**Teaching guidance:** Demonstrate the effect of temperature on particles: heat a sealed gas syringe gently — the piston moves out as the gas expands because particles move faster and push harder on the syringe walls. Cool the gas — the piston moves back in. Explain using the particle model: increasing temperature increases the kinetic energy of particles, so they move faster, collide more frequently and forcefully, and move further apart. This explains thermal expansion (materials expand when heated) and changes of state (at sufficiently high temperatures, particles overcome intermolecular forces). Connect to gas pressure (SC-KS3-C070) and changes of state (SC-KS3-C071).

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think temperature and heat are the same thing — temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles, while heat is the energy transferred from a hotter to a cooler object. Students may also think particles expand when heated — the particles themselves do not change size; they move faster and the spaces between them increase.

**Key vocabulary:** temperature, particle, kinetic energy, motion, speed, vibration, thermal expansion, heating, cooling, thermometer, kelvin, Celsius, energy, intermolecular force, spacing

#### SC-KS3-C166 — Internal energy
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding internal energy stored in materials

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce internal energy as the total kinetic energy and potential energy of all the particles in a system. Heating a substance increases its internal energy: the kinetic energy of particles increases (temperature rises) and/or the potential energy increases (during changes of state, when particles move apart against intermolecular forces). Explain that internal energy is the sum of all particle energies — it depends on both temperature and the number of particles (a bathtub of warm water has more internal energy than a cup of boiling water). Connect to specific heat capacity and latent heat concepts qualitatively.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often confuse internal energy with temperature — a large object at a low temperature can have more internal energy than a small object at a high temperature, because internal energy depends on the number of particles as well as their average energy. Students may also think internal energy only refers to kinetic energy — it includes both kinetic and potential energy of the particles.

**Key vocabulary:** internal energy, kinetic energy, potential energy, particle, temperature, change of state, heating, thermal energy, system, total energy, intermolecular force, latent heat, specific heat capacity

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS3-D015-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Sorting, classifying and identifying similarities directly trains pupils to recognise regularities and use them to predict or generalise.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Evidence and Argument**: What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Drawing conclusions from observations requires constructing a claim supported by specific evidence — not just describing what was seen.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'

**SC-KS3-D015-CL002:**
- **Evidence and Argument** (primary): What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: This cluster asks pupils to gather, record or communicate scientific findings — the core cognitive demand is evaluating what counts as valid evidence and how to present it clearly.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Scientific observations and enquiry serve to establish causal relationships; framing questions around 'what causes X' gives purpose to the observation work.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

**SC-KS3-D015-CL003:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Chemistry at KS4 is rich in patterns — periodic table trends, reactivity series, reaction type categories — that allow pupils to predict the behaviour of unfamiliar substances.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Chemical reactions involve causal mechanisms (electron transfer causes bonding, acid-base reactions follow proton transfer) that explain observed phenomena rather than merely describing them.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

**SC-KS3-D015-CL004:**
- **Energy and Matter** (primary): Where does the energy come from, where does it go, and is anything conserved?
  Why: Energy clusters require pupils to trace where energy comes from, how it is transferred or transformed, and where it ends up — conservation and flow are the central ideas.
  AI instruction: Use the ENERGY AND MATTER lens: prompt pupils to trace energy pathways, identify transformations between energy forms, track matter through cycles, and apply conservation thinking. Useful questions: 'Where did the energy come from?', 'What happened to it?', 'Is anything created or destroyed?', 'Can you draw the energy flow?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Physical phenomena (shadows, circuits, forces) involve clear causal chains: changing one variable produces a predictable effect, making cause-and-effect reasoning the investigative frame.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

## Domain: SC-KS3-D016 — Physics - Space Physics
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS3 | **Age:** 11-14 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Space physics at KS3 develops pupils' astronomical understanding from the basic solar system model studied at primary school to a more detailed knowledge of the universe — its scale, structure and the physical processes that govern it. Pupils learn about the life cycle of stars, the structure of the solar system and the role of gravity in determining the motion of planets, moons and other celestial bodies. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to understand the difference between a planet, a dwarf planet, a moon and a star, and to appreciate the vast scale of the universe using appropriate units (light-years, astronomical units). Pupils also study the evidence for the Big Bang theory and the expanding universe, connecting observational astronomy to fundamental physics.

### Concepts (5)

#### SC-KS3-C167 — Gravity force
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding gravity and calculating weight using W = mg

**Teaching guidance:** Distinguish clearly between mass (the amount of matter in an object, measured in kilograms) and weight (the gravitational force on that mass, measured in newtons). Teach the equation: weight = mass × gravitational field strength (W = mg), where g = 9.8 N/kg on Earth (often approximated as 10 N/kg). Calculate the weight of various objects. Compare weight on different planets by using different values of g (e.g., g on the Moon is about 1.6 N/kg, on Jupiter about 25 N/kg). Use a balance (measures mass) and a newton meter (measures weight) to demonstrate the difference. Connect to gravity and forces.

**Common misconceptions:** Students routinely confuse mass and weight — mass is constant regardless of location, but weight changes with gravitational field strength. An astronaut has the same mass on the Moon as on Earth but weighs about one-sixth as much. Students also say 'I weigh 50 kilograms' — technically they have a mass of 50 kg and a weight of about 500 N on Earth.

**Key vocabulary:** weight, mass, gravity, gravitational field strength, newton, kilogram, W = mg, g, force, measurement, balance, newton meter, planet, Moon, Earth, acceleration due to gravity

#### SC-KS3-C168 — Gravitational field strength
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that gravitational field strength varies on different planets and stars

**Teaching guidance:** Explain that gravitational field strength (g) varies depending on the mass and size of the celestial body. On Earth, g ≈ 9.8 N/kg; on the Moon, g ≈ 1.6 N/kg; on Jupiter, g ≈ 25 N/kg; on Mars, g ≈ 3.7 N/kg. Have pupils calculate their weight on different planets and moons. Discuss why g varies: larger, more massive bodies have stronger gravitational fields. Introduce the concept that g also decreases with distance from the centre of a body — astronauts in orbit experience lower g (though not zero — they are in freefall). Connect to weight (SC-KS3-C167) and space physics.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think astronauts in orbit are weightless because there is no gravity — gravity still acts on them; they appear weightless because they are in continuous freefall around the Earth. Students may also think the Moon has no gravity — the Moon has about one-sixth of Earth's gravitational field strength.

**Key vocabulary:** gravitational field strength, g, N/kg, planet, Moon, Mars, Jupiter, mass, weight, surface gravity, orbit, freefall, weightlessness, celestial body, variation, distance

#### SC-KS3-C169 — Solar system structure
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 2

Knowledge of the Sun as a star, other stars, galaxies, and the structure of the universe

**Teaching guidance:** Use scale models and animations to teach the structure of the solar system: the Sun (a star), eight planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune), dwarf planets (including Pluto), moons, asteroids, and comets. Emphasise the scale: the distances between planets are vastly larger than the planets themselves. Extend to the Milky Way galaxy (our solar system is one of billions of star systems) and the observable universe (billions of galaxies). Use astronomical units (AU) for solar system distances and light years for distances to other stars. Have pupils construct a scale model of the solar system.

**Common misconceptions:** Students often underestimate the scale of the solar system — if the Sun were a football, the nearest star would be hundreds of kilometres away. Students may also think the Sun is the largest star — the Sun is a medium-sized star; many stars are far larger. Students sometimes think Pluto is still classified as a planet — it was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006.

**Key vocabulary:** Sun, star, planet, dwarf planet, moon, asteroid, comet, solar system, galaxy, Milky Way, universe, astronomical unit, AU, orbit, gravity, terrestrial planet, gas giant

#### SC-KS3-C170 — Earth's motion
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Understanding seasons, Earth's tilt, and day length variations

**Teaching guidance:** Explain that the Earth orbits the Sun once per year and rotates on its axis once per day. The Earth's axis is tilted at approximately 23.5° to the plane of its orbit. This tilt causes the seasons: when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, it receives more direct sunlight and experiences summer; when tilted away, it receives less direct sunlight and experiences winter. Demonstrate using a globe and a lamp. Discuss day length variation: in summer, days are longer because the tilted hemisphere is exposed to the Sun for more hours. Connect to the Southern Hemisphere experiencing opposite seasons.

**Common misconceptions:** Students very commonly think seasons are caused by the Earth being closer to or further from the Sun — the Earth's orbit is nearly circular, and the Northern Hemisphere has summer when Earth is actually slightly further from the Sun. Seasons are caused by the tilt of the Earth's axis. Students may also think it is always summer in the Southern Hemisphere — the Southern Hemisphere has opposite seasons to the Northern Hemisphere.

**Key vocabulary:** season, tilt, axis, orbit, rotation, day length, hemisphere, summer, winter, equinox, solstice, direct sunlight, angle of incidence, 23.5 degrees, year, day, night

#### SC-KS3-C171 — Light year
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding the light year as a unit of astronomical distance

**Teaching guidance:** Explain that a light year is the distance light travels in one year — approximately 9.46 × 10¹² km (about 9.5 trillion km). It is a unit of distance, not time. Use it to express astronomical distances: the nearest star (Proxima Centauri) is about 4.2 light years away, the Milky Way is about 100,000 light years across, and the nearest large galaxy (Andromeda) is about 2.5 million light years away. Discuss what it means: when we look at a star 100 light years away, we see it as it was 100 years ago. Connect to the speed of light (SC-KS3-C142) and the structure of the universe (SC-KS3-C169).

**Common misconceptions:** Students very commonly think a light year is a unit of time — it is a unit of distance (the distance light travels in one year). Students may also struggle to grasp the scale — use analogies and comparisons to make the distances more tangible (if the Sun were a grain of sand, the nearest star would be another grain of sand several kilometres away).

**Key vocabulary:** light year, distance, speed of light, astronomical distance, Proxima Centauri, Milky Way, Andromeda, galaxy, star, universe, 9.46 × 10¹² km, lookback time, parsec, astronomical unit

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS3-D016-CL001:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Earth science topics involve large-scale systems (water cycle, solar system, rock cycle) where components interact in cycles — mapping the system helps pupils understand processes they cannot directly observe.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Stability and Change**: What keeps this stable, what causes change, and how quickly does change happen?
  Why: Geological, atmospheric and astronomical systems exhibit both stability (seasons repeat, rock types persist) and change (erosion, climate shifts), making stability-and-change a productive alternative framing.
  AI instruction: Use the STABILITY AND CHANGE lens: prompt pupils to identify what conditions keep a system in balance, what disrupts equilibrium, and how change can be gradual or sudden. Useful questions: 'What keeps this the same?', 'What would tip it into change?', 'Is the change reversible?', 'How fast is this changing, and why?'

**SC-KS3-D016-CL002:**
- **Energy and Matter** (primary): Where does the energy come from, where does it go, and is anything conserved?
  Why: Energy clusters require pupils to trace where energy comes from, how it is transferred or transformed, and where it ends up — conservation and flow are the central ideas.
  AI instruction: Use the ENERGY AND MATTER lens: prompt pupils to trace energy pathways, identify transformations between energy forms, track matter through cycles, and apply conservation thinking. Useful questions: 'Where did the energy come from?', 'What happened to it?', 'Is anything created or destroyed?', 'Can you draw the energy flow?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Physical phenomena (shadows, circuits, forces) involve clear causal chains: changing one variable produces a predictable effect, making cause-and-effect reasoning the investigative frame.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

**SC-KS3-D016-CL003:**
- **Stability and Change** (primary): What keeps this stable, what causes change, and how quickly does change happen?
  Why: Life cycles and seasonal change require pupils to track what changes over time (growth, transformation) versus what remains constant (the overall cycle), making stability-and-change the primary cognitive frame.
  AI instruction: Use the STABILITY AND CHANGE lens: prompt pupils to identify what conditions keep a system in balance, what disrupts equilibrium, and how change can be gradual or sudden. Useful questions: 'What keeps this the same?', 'What would tip it into change?', 'Is the change reversible?', 'How fast is this changing, and why?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Pupils investigate what conditions (light, water, temperature) cause growth or seasonal transitions — cause-and-effect reasoning underpins the practical investigation work.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

### Interaction Types (13 total, 8 primary)

**Primary (recommended for this year group):**
- **Compare and Contrast Table** (higher_order, keyboard): Structured table for comparing two or more concepts, events, or organisms. Child populates cells. Used from Y5 for analysis tasks.
- **Inference Task — Socratic Questioning** (higher_order, text_or_voice): Guided Socratic question chain where the AI asks a sequence of progressively more specific questions to scaffold inference from text or data. Used from Y4.
- **Multiple Choice — 4 Options** (selection, tap_or_click): Standard 4-option multiple choice. The default format for Y4 onwards. Distractors should represent genuine misconceptions.
- **Multiple Choice — 5 Options (with None/All)** (selection, tap_or_click): 5-option multiple choice, can include 'None of the above' or 'All of the above'. Appropriate for Y5+ to increase cognitive demand.
- **Text Annotation — Add Comment** (reading_tool, keyboard): Add typed or voiced comments to highlighted text passages. Used for literary analysis and close reading from Y5.
- **Text Highlight and Select** (reading_tool, touch_or_mouse): Highlight a passage in a reading extract to identify evidence, inference clues, or key vocabulary. Used from Y4 for comprehension tasks.
- **Text Input — Paragraph** (text_input, keyboard): Extended writing response, 30–80 words. Appropriate for Y5+ analytical and evaluative tasks.

### Pedagogy Techniques (5)

**Generation Effect**
Asking the learner to produce or recall information before it is shown to them. Self-generated items are retained 20-30% better than passively read items. The act of generation — even unsuccessful generation — deepens subsequent encoding when the answer is revealed.
Evidence: Slamecka & Graf 1978, McNamara & Healy 1995. Effect persists even when generation fails (unsuccessful generation followed by feedback shows better retention than study alone).
Implementation: Before showing the worked example or revealing the formula: 'What do you remember about how [X] works? Say or write it before I show you.' Accept partial and incorrect responses — the generation attempt, not the answer, is the mechanism.

**Interleaved Practice**
Mixing different types of problems or concepts within a session rather than blocked practice (all of one type, then all of another). Interleaving requires the learner to identify the problem type before solving — this discrimination step is the source of its effect.
Evidence: Bjork 2011, Rohrer & Taylor 2007, Rohrer et al. 2015. Effect size d=0.42 over blocked practice. Transfer advantage approximately 30-40% on delayed tests.
Implementation: Mix the current concept with 2-3 previously mastered concepts in the retrieval practice phase of a session. Tell the child: 'You are practising different types of problems — that is what makes you better.' Surface features vary; underlying structure is the same.

**Spaced Practice**
Distributing practice over time rather than massing it in a single session. Creates desirable difficulty through time-based forgetting and subsequent retrieval. The gap between practice sessions is the mechanism — not re-studying, but retrieving after a delay.
Evidence: Ebbinghaus 1885, Cepeda et al. 2006 (meta-analysis, n=317 studies). Effect size d=0.46. Optimal spacing interval increases as retention target increases.
Implementation: Return to a previously taught concept after a gap of 1-21 days (gap increases as mastery grows). Do not re-teach — retrieve only. The system selects spacing interval based on days since last correct response.

**Testing Effect (Retrieval-Only Practice)**
Using low-stakes tests as a learning tool, not just assessment. Retrieving information from memory strengthens memory traces more than restudying the material. Once mastery is established, all further exposure should be retrieval-only (no re-teaching).
Evidence: Roediger & Karpicke 2006, Roediger & Butler 2011. Effect size d=0.50-0.80. Effect is largest when retrieval is effortful but successful. Prior retrieval also enhances future learning of related material.
Implementation: After mastery is established (5+ correct, 80%+ success rate, 2+ session dates), switch to retrieval-only practice for that concept — questions only, no re-study, no worked examples. The spacing schedule continues. Do not re-teach unless mastery drops below threshold.

**Varied Practice (Surface Variation)**
Changing the surface features of practice problems (different contexts, numbers, scenarios, word choices) while keeping the underlying structure the same. Forces the learner to identify the deep structure rather than applying a surface-level pattern match.
Evidence: Schmidt & Bjork 1992, Kornell & Bjork 2008. Primary mechanism for transfer to novel problems. Contrast with blocked practice which improves performance during training but not on transfer tests.
Implementation: Use the same underlying concept but with different surface contexts across practice problems within a session (e.g., fractions with pizzas, then with ribbons, then with time). Do not vary the underlying structure — vary what it is about.
