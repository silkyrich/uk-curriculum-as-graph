# Year 2 Mathematics -- Lesson Plan

**Teacher:** Mrs Henderson
**Class:** Year 2 (ages 6-7)
**Domains covered:** Number and Place Value (MA-Y2-D001), Addition and Subtraction (MA-Y2-D002), Multiplication and Division (MA-Y2-D003)
**Total lessons:** 33
**Term structure:** Block A (Autumn 1), Block B (Autumn 1-2), Block C (Spring 1), Block D (Spring 1-2)

---

## Block A: Number and Place Value (Lessons 1-8)

*Cluster basis: MA-Y2-D001-CL001 (followed), MA-Y2-D001-CL002 (followed), MA-Y2-D001-CL003 (repositioned -- see teaching log)*

---

### Lesson 1: Counting in steps of 2 and 5 (revision and extension)
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C001
**Type:** New content (revision of Y1 + extension)

Begin with a quick diagnostic: can every child count in 2s to 20 and in 5s to 50? Use a counting stick and choral counting to establish the rhythm. Then extend: count in 2s from 0 to 100, count in 5s from 0 to 100, count backwards in both. Shade multiples on a hundred square to see the visual patterns. The key teaching point is that these sequences continue beyond the numbers children worked with in Year 1, and that every number in the sequence is a "multiple" of 2 or 5.

**Key vocabulary:** count in twos, count in fives, multiple, step, sequence, pattern, forward, backward

---

### Lesson 2: Counting in steps of 3 (new learning)
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C001
**Type:** New content

Counting in 3s is genuinely new and significantly harder than 2s and 5s because the digit pattern is less obvious. Begin concretely: make groups of 3 using cubes, count the total as each group is added (3, 6, 9, 12...). Use a hundred square with every third number shaded -- children observe that the pattern is irregular across columns, unlike the neat columns produced by 5s and 10s. Practise choral counting in 3s from 0 to 30 and back. Address the decade-boundary errors explicitly: after 18, the next count is 21, not 20.

**Key vocabulary:** count in threes, multiple, step, sequence, pattern, forward, backward

---

### Lesson 3: Odd and even numbers
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C011
**Type:** New content

Connect directly to yesterday's counting in 2s. Start concretely: give each child a handful of cubes and ask them to share the cubes into two equal groups. If they can, the number is even; if one is left over, the number is odd. Repeat with several quantities. Then link to counting in 2s: the numbers we land on when counting in 2s from 0 are the even numbers. Establish the digit rule as a pattern observation after many examples: even numbers end in 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8. Test with larger numbers the children have not seen before (is 76 even or odd?).

**Key vocabulary:** even, odd, multiple of two, share equally, pairs, remainder

---

### Lesson 4: Odd and even -- deeper understanding and patterns
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C011, MA-Y2-C021 (first touch)
**Type:** Practice / consolidation

What happens when you add two even numbers? Two odd numbers? An odd and an even? Children investigate using cubes and record their findings. This is the first touch of patterns work (C021) -- they are looking for a rule in a mathematical pattern. Introduce the hundred square coloured by odd/even and ask children to describe what they notice. Address the misconception about 0 (it is even, because 0 objects can be shared equally into two groups of 0). End with a sorting activity: odd/even number sort with two-digit numbers.

**Key vocabulary:** even, odd, pattern, rule, predict, always, sometimes, never

---

### Lesson 5: Place value -- tens and ones with Dienes
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C002
**Type:** New content

This is foundational. Every child needs physical Dienes blocks (ten-sticks and unit cubes). Build numbers: "Show me 34 using your Dienes." Establish the language: 34 has 3 tens and 4 ones; the 3 represents 30, not 3. Use place value mats (T | O columns) to organise the blocks. Progress to numeral card overlays: 30 over 4 to make 34, physically showing that 34 = 30 + 4. Begin flexible partitioning: 34 = 30 + 4, but also 34 = 20 + 14. Use the exchange model with Dienes -- swap one ten-stick for 10 unit cubes to show 34 = 20 + 14. This flexible partitioning is critical for subtraction later.

**Key vocabulary:** tens, ones, digit, value, place value, partition, exchange, two-digit number, represent

---

### Lesson 6: Place value -- reading, writing and representing numbers to 100
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C002
**Type:** Practice

Practise reading and writing numbers to 100 in numerals and words. Use the number line as a key representation: children locate numbers on a 0-100 number line, first marked in tens, then with intermediate marks. Estimate where numbers go. Address zero as a place holder: 30 has 3 tens and 0 ones; 50 has 5 tens and 0 ones. The common error here is children reading 30 as "three" or thinking the zero means nothing. Represent the same number in three ways: Dienes, numeral, place value chart. Practise partitioning at least 10 different numbers, including flexible partitioning.

**Key vocabulary:** tens, ones, place value, partition, numeral, number line, estimate, represent, zero, place holder

---

### Lesson 7: Comparing and ordering numbers to 100
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C003
**Type:** New content

Introduce the < > = symbols. Begin concretely: two towers of cubes of different heights -- which has more? Introduce the symbol as "the open end points to the bigger number" (or the hungry crocodile, whichever the children latch onto). The critical teaching point is the METHOD for comparing two-digit numbers: compare the tens digit first; if the tens are equal, compare the ones. Use place value understanding from the previous lessons to justify this: 47 > 39 because 4 tens is more than 3 tens, regardless of the ones. Practise with pairs of numbers, including cases where tens are equal (45 vs 48) and where children might be misled by the ones digit (19 vs 21).

**Key vocabulary:** greater than, less than, equal to, compare, symbol, <, >, =

---

### Lesson 8: Ordering sets of numbers and checkpoint
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C003, MA-Y2-C002
**Type:** Practice + assessment checkpoint

Order sets of 4-5 numbers from smallest to largest and largest to smallest. Use the language "ascending" and "descending." Practise inserting numbers into an ordered sequence: "Where does 56 go in this list: 43, 51, _, 62, 78?" This consolidates both comparing (C003) and place value (C002). The second half of the lesson is a short written checkpoint: 10 questions covering place value partitioning, reading/writing numbers, comparing with symbols, and ordering. This replaces the standalone assessment cluster (D001-CL004).

**Key vocabulary:** order, ascending, descending, smallest, largest, greater than, less than, compare

---

## Block B: Addition and Subtraction (Lessons 9-20)

*Cluster basis: MA-Y2-D002-CL001 (followed, expanded to 8 lessons), MA-Y2-D002-CL003 (followed, compressed to 4 lessons). Assessment cluster D002-CL002 replaced with embedded checkpoint.*

---

### Lesson 9: Number bonds to 10 and 20 -- rapid recall
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C004
**Type:** New content (consolidation of Y1 + fluency focus)

Quick diagnostic: show number bond flash cards to 10. Any child not recalling instantly needs targeted intervention. For the whole class: rapid-fire oral practice of bonds to 20 using the "ping-pong" format (teacher says 13, child says 7). Introduce the language of "sum" and "difference" which are new in Year 2. The teaching point is AUTOMATICITY -- children should not be counting on their fingers for 8 + 6 by this point. If they are, provide structured support using ten frames. Practise all three forms: 8 + 6 = 14, 14 - 6 = 8, 14 - 8 = 6.

**Key vocabulary:** number bond, recall, fluent, sum, difference, addition, subtraction, fact

---

### Lesson 10: Derived facts to 100
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C004, MA-Y2-C002 (cross-domain link)
**Type:** New content

This is where place value meets number facts. If you know 3 + 7 = 10, what is 30 + 70? Show this with Dienes: three ten-sticks plus seven ten-sticks makes ten ten-sticks, which is 100. The structure is identical -- only the unit has changed from ones to tens. Derive: 6 + 4 = 10, so 60 + 40 = 100. Practise: what must I add to 50 to make 100? To 80? Extend to near-facts: if 30 + 70 = 100, what is 30 + 71? Use the hundred square and number line to support. This lesson explicitly connects place value (C002, from Block A) to number fact derivation -- a cross-domain link the graph did not make explicit.

**Key vocabulary:** derive, related fact, tens, number bond, place value

---

### Lesson 11: Adding a two-digit number and ones
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C005
**Type:** New content

First of four calculation-type lessons. Model with Dienes: 34 + 5. The tens stay the same; we add the ones. Show on a number line: start at 34, count on 5, land on 39. Now a harder case: 37 + 6. The ones add to more than 10, so we cross the ten boundary. Model with Dienes: 7 ones + 6 ones = 13 ones = 1 ten and 3 ones. Exchange. 37 + 6 = 43. This "bridging through 10" is the key difficulty. Practise both types (with and without bridging). Begin column recording alongside the concrete work: write 37 + 6 in a place value grid.

**Key vocabulary:** add, ones, tens, count on, bridge, exchange, carry, column

---

### Lesson 12: Adding a two-digit number and tens
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C005
**Type:** New content

Model with Dienes: 34 + 20. We add the tens; the ones stay the same. This is conceptually simpler than lesson 11 because no bridging occurs. Show on a number line: start at 34, jump 20 (two jumps of 10), land on 54. Practise a range: 45 + 30, 18 + 50, 67 + 20. Introduce subtracting tens: 54 - 20 = 34, 78 - 30 = 48. Column recording throughout. Connect to place value: adding 20 means adding 2 tens, which changes the tens digit but not the ones digit.

**Key vocabulary:** add, subtract, tens, place value, jump, number line, column

---

### Lesson 13: Adding two two-digit numbers
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C005
**Type:** New content

The most challenging calculation type. Model 43 + 25 with Dienes: combine the tens (4 tens + 2 tens = 6 tens), combine the ones (3 + 5 = 8), total = 68. Partitioning strategy: 43 + 25 = (40 + 20) + (3 + 5) = 60 + 8 = 68. Now with bridging: 37 + 26. Ones: 7 + 6 = 13 = 1 ten and 3 ones. Tens: 3 tens + 2 tens + 1 ten (exchanged) = 6 tens. Total = 63. Column recording is essential here -- it mirrors the concrete Dienes work and prepares for formal written methods in KS2. Emphasise: line up the tens and ones carefully.

**Key vocabulary:** add, partition, two-digit, tens, ones, exchange, column, total, sum

---

### Lesson 14: Subtracting with two-digit numbers
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C005
**Type:** New content

Subtraction is harder. Model 48 - 23 with Dienes: remove 2 tens and 3 ones. Straightforward. Now model 42 - 17: we need to remove 7 ones but only have 2. Exchange one ten for 10 ones: 42 becomes 30 + 12. Now remove 7 ones (12 - 7 = 5) and 1 ten (3 - 1 = 2). Answer: 25. This exchange concept links directly to the flexible partitioning taught in lesson 5 (42 = 30 + 12). Address the most common error explicitly: children who subtract in the wrong direction (2 - 7 = 5, giving 35 instead of 25). Use bar models alongside Dienes.

**Key vocabulary:** subtract, difference, exchange, partition, count back, column, bar model

---

### Lesson 15: Adding three one-digit numbers
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C005
**Type:** New content

This is a distinct skill. Model: 4 + 7 + 6. Strategy: look for a pair that makes 10 first. 4 + 6 = 10, so 4 + 7 + 6 = 10 + 7 = 17. This requires children to scan all three numbers before calculating -- a significant strategic shift from left-to-right computation. Practise: 8 + 3 + 2, 5 + 9 + 5, 7 + 4 + 3. If no pair makes 10, add the easiest pair first. Note: this strategy relies on commutativity and associativity (C006), which we will formalise in lesson 18. For now, establish it as a practical strategy.

**Key vocabulary:** add, total, sum, number bond, strategy, look for ten, three numbers

---

### Lesson 16: Mixed addition and subtraction practice
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C005, MA-Y2-C004
**Type:** Practice / consolidation

A practice lesson covering all four calculation types plus derived facts. Set up as carousel activities: (1) Dienes station -- build and solve TU + TU calculations, (2) Number line station -- count on and count back, (3) Column recording station -- write calculations in place value columns, (4) Word problem station -- solve problems in context (money, measures). This is where children who are struggling get targeted support with the specific calculation type causing difficulty. Challenge: include problems where children must choose the operation (addition or subtraction) from the context.

**Key vocabulary:** add, subtract, total, difference, method, choose, solve, check

---

### Lesson 17: Addition and subtraction checkpoint
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C004, MA-Y2-C005
**Type:** Assessment checkpoint

A short written assessment (15 questions, 20 minutes): 5 rapid recall facts (bonds to 20), 3 derived facts to 100, 2 additions without bridging, 2 additions with bridging, 2 subtractions, 1 three-number addition. This replaces the 6-lesson assessment cluster (D002-CL002). Results inform groupings for the next lessons. Children who score below 60% on the calculation questions will receive additional small-group support during the commutativity/inverse lessons that follow.

**Key vocabulary:** (assessment -- no new vocabulary)

---

### Lesson 18: Commutativity of addition
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C006
**Type:** New content

Does 5 + 3 give the same answer as 3 + 5? Children investigate with cubes: make a tower of 5 red and 3 blue. Turn it upside down -- now it is 3 blue and 5 red. Same total. Try with larger numbers: 24 + 13 and 13 + 24. Introduce the word "commutative" -- it means the order does not matter. Now test subtraction: is 8 - 3 the same as 3 - 8? Use a number line: start at 8, count back 3, land on 5. Start at 3, try to count back 8 -- you go below zero. Subtraction is NOT commutative. Connect to checking: if you calculate 45 + 23 = 68, you can check by doing 23 + 45. If you get 68 again, your answer is likely correct.

**Key vocabulary:** commutative, order, same total, check, rearrange, addition, subtraction

---

### Lesson 19: Inverse relationship -- fact families
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C007
**Type:** New content

Addition and subtraction undo each other. Start with the bar model (part-whole model): the whole is 12, the parts are 5 and 7. From this one model, write four facts: 5 + 7 = 12, 7 + 5 = 12, 12 - 7 = 5, 12 - 5 = 7. This is a "fact family." Practise generating fact families from given numbers. Then apply: if 36 + 27 = 63, what is 63 - 27? Children should be able to answer immediately without recalculating. Use the inverse to check: calculate 45 - 18 = 27, then check with 27 + 18 = 45.

**Key vocabulary:** inverse, opposite, undo, fact family, part, whole, check, bar model

---

### Lesson 20: Inverse relationship -- missing number problems
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C007, MA-Y2-C006
**Type:** Practice

Missing number problems require using the inverse. If ? + 9 = 16, then ? = 16 - 9 = 7. If ? - 5 = 13, then ? = 13 + 5 = 18. The position of the unknown changes the strategy. Use the bar model to make the structure visible: which part is missing? Practise all three positions: a + b = ?, a + ? = c, ? + b = c, and the subtraction equivalents. The last position (? - 5 = 13) is consistently the hardest and needs extra practice. Connect to commutativity (C006): use reordering to make the check easier.

**Key vocabulary:** missing number, inverse, unknown, bar model, fact family, check

---

## Block C: Multiplication and Division (Lessons 21-30)

*Cluster basis: MA-Y2-D003-CL001 (followed, 7 lessons with internal structure), MA-Y2-D003-CL003 (followed, 3 lessons). Assessment cluster D003-CL002 replaced with embedded checkpoint.*

---

### Lesson 21: The 2 times table -- from counting to multiplication
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C008, MA-Y2-C009, MA-Y2-C001 (cross-domain link)
**Type:** New content

Connect back to Block A: we already know how to count in 2s (C001). Today we formalise this as the 2 times table. Make groups of 2 objects: 1 group of 2 = 2, 2 groups of 2 = 4, 3 groups of 2 = 6... Write the multiplication statements alongside: 1 x 2 = 2, 2 x 2 = 4, 3 x 2 = 6... (C009). Show on a number line with equal jumps of 2. Connect to even numbers (C011, from Block A): every answer in the 2 times table is even. Introduce the related division facts: if 4 x 2 = 8, then 8 / 2 = 4. How many groups of 2 in 8? Four groups. Practise rapid recall up to 12 x 2.

**Key vocabulary:** multiply, times, product, multiplication table, groups of, divide, division, lots of, x, /, =

---

### Lesson 22: The 5 times table -- groups, clock faces, and coins
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C008, MA-Y2-C009
**Type:** New content

Build from counting in 5s. Make groups of 5 objects. Write multiplication statements. Connect to the clock face: the minute hand moves in 5-minute intervals, so telling the time uses the 5 times table (5 past = 1 x 5, 10 past = 2 x 5, quarter past = 3 x 5). Connect to 5p coins: how much are six 5p coins worth? 6 x 5 = 30p. Show on a number line. Write related division facts: 35 / 5 = 7, because 7 groups of 5 make 35. Notice the pattern in the ones digits: 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0... All multiples of 5 end in 0 or 5.

**Key vocabulary:** multiply, times, product, five times table, clock face, 5p, multiples of 5, divide, groups of

---

### Lesson 23: The 10 times table -- connections to place value
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C008, MA-Y2-C009, MA-Y2-C002 (cross-domain link)
**Type:** New content

The 10 times table connects directly to place value (C002). Model with Dienes: 3 x 10 means 3 ten-sticks, which is 30. Multiplying by 10 gives the tens value of the number. 7 x 10 = 70 (7 tens). Show that the 10 times table is double the 5 times table: if 3 x 5 = 15, then 3 x 10 = 30. This connection between tables is explicitly mentioned in the NC guidance. Write formal statements. Division: 80 / 10 = 8, because 80 is 8 tens. Practise rapid recall. Address the misconception: "multiplying by 10 means adding a zero" -- this works procedurally for whole numbers but misrepresents the mathematics. Better: "multiplying by 10 makes each digit worth ten times as much."

**Key vocabulary:** multiply, ten times table, place value, tens, multiples of 10, divide, double

---

### Lesson 24: Connecting the 2, 5 and 10 times tables
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C008
**Type:** Practice / consolidation

Explore the connections between the three tables. Use arrays on squared paper: cut out a 4 x 2 array, a 4 x 5 array, and a 4 x 10 array. Compare the products. Notice: 4 x 10 = 4 x 5 + 4 x 5 (the 10 times table is double the 5 times table). Notice: 4 x 10 = 4 x 2 + 4 x 2 + 4 x 2 + 4 x 2 + 4 x 2. Play "table tennis" rapid recall game: teacher calls a fact from any of the three tables, child responds. Timed challenge: how many facts can you recall in 2 minutes? (Note: this is a personal best challenge, not a competitive one -- we do not use leaderboards.)

**Key vocabulary:** times table, connection, double, multiple, array, rapid recall

---

### Lesson 25: Writing multiplication and division statements from contexts
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C009
**Type:** Practice

Focus on the formal notation. Present real-world contexts: "There are 5 bags with 2 apples in each. How many apples altogether?" Children write 5 x 2 = 10. "There are 20 sweets shared equally between 5 children. How many each?" Children write 20 / 5 = 4. Distinguish between multiplication as "groups of" and division as both sharing and grouping. Common error: writing 2 x 5 instead of 5 x 2 for "5 groups of 2." While the answer is the same (commutativity), the representation matters for understanding. Division error: writing 5 / 20 instead of 20 / 5. Use bar models to support.

**Key vocabulary:** multiply, divide, statement, equation, x, /, =, groups of, shared between, how many groups

---

### Lesson 26: Arrays -- the bridge to commutativity
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C008, MA-Y2-C010
**Type:** New content

Arrays are the single most important representation for multiplicative reasoning. Make a 3 x 5 array with counters. Count: 15. Write: 3 x 5 = 15. Now physically rotate the array 90 degrees. It becomes a 5 x 3 array. Count: still 15. Write: 5 x 3 = 15. The same objects, the same total, different arrangement. This is commutativity: 3 x 5 = 5 x 3. Repeat with other arrays. Children make their own arrays on squared paper, write both multiplication facts, and rotate to demonstrate commutativity. Link back to lesson 18: addition is also commutative -- there is a pattern across operations.

**Key vocabulary:** array, row, column, commutative, rotate, turn, same product, multiplication

---

### Lesson 27: Commutativity of multiplication and non-commutativity of division
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C010
**Type:** New content

Deepen the commutativity work. If 4 x 5 = 20 and 5 x 4 = 20, does this work for division? Try: 20 / 5 = 4 and 20 / 4 = 5. These are both valid, but they are DIFFERENT division facts, not the same one reordered. Now try: is 20 / 5 the same as 5 / 20? Use a sharing context: share 20 sweets among 5 children (4 each). Share 5 sweets among 20 children -- that does not give a whole number. Division is NOT commutative. Draw the parallel explicitly: addition is commutative but subtraction is not (lesson 18); multiplication is commutative but division is not. There is a pattern: the "undoing" operations (subtraction, division) are not commutative.

**Key vocabulary:** commutative, non-commutative, division, multiplication, array, order, same, different

---

### Lesson 28: Multiplication and division fact families
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C008, MA-Y2-C010, MA-Y2-C007 (cross-domain link)
**Type:** Practice

Just as addition and subtraction have fact families (lesson 19), so do multiplication and division. From a 4 x 5 array: 4 x 5 = 20, 5 x 4 = 20, 20 / 5 = 4, 20 / 4 = 5. Write complete fact families for facts from the 2, 5 and 10 times tables. Use the bar model with equal parts to represent the structure. This parallels the inverse relationship work from the addition domain (C007) -- multiplication and division undo each other, just as addition and subtraction do. Missing number problems: ? x 5 = 30, 40 / ? = 8. Use the inverse to solve.

**Key vocabulary:** fact family, inverse, multiplication, division, missing number, array, bar model

---

### Lesson 29: Solving multiplication and division problems in context
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C008, MA-Y2-C009, MA-Y2-C010
**Type:** Practice / application

Word problems requiring children to choose the operation. "I have 6 bags of 5 oranges. How many oranges?" (multiplication). "I have 30 stickers to share equally among 10 friends. How many each?" (division). "There are 4 rows of 2 chairs. How many chairs?" (multiplication using array language). Include two-step problems: "I buy 3 packs of 5 pencils and give away 4. How many do I have?" Children must write the full mathematical statement for each problem. This lesson consolidates the entire multiplication domain.

**Key vocabulary:** solve, problem, choose, operation, multiply, divide, statement, context, altogether, share, groups

---

### Lesson 30: Multiplication and division checkpoint
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C008, MA-Y2-C009, MA-Y2-C010
**Type:** Assessment checkpoint

Short written assessment (15 questions, 20 minutes): 6 rapid recall facts (2 from each table, including division), 3 "write the statement" from pictures, 2 commutativity demonstrations ("write two multiplication facts for this array"), 2 missing number problems, 2 word problems. This replaces the 7-lesson assessment cluster (D003-CL002). Results inform intervention groupings for the consolidation block.

**Key vocabulary:** (assessment -- no new vocabulary)

---

## Block D: Consolidation, Patterns, and Final Assessment (Lessons 31-33)

*This block draws together all three domains with cross-cutting work and addresses MA-Y2-D001-CL003 (patterns and sequences).*

---

### Lesson 31: Patterns and sequences with mathematical objects
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C021
**Type:** New content (standalone strand)

Patterns work connects to everything we have done. Begin with shape patterns: triangle, circle, triangle, circle... what comes next? Progress to more complex repeating patterns (ABB, ABBC) and patterns that change in multiple attributes (shape AND colour). Connect to number sequences: the 2 times table is a sequence with a rule ("add 2 each time"), the 5 times table is a sequence with a rule ("add 5 each time"). Growing patterns: 1, 3, 6, 10... (triangular numbers shown with dot arrays). Children create their own patterns for a partner to continue. The key teaching point is identifying the RULE, not just copying the pattern.

**Key vocabulary:** pattern, sequence, repeat, rule, next, continue, predict, term, arrangement, growing pattern

---

### Lesson 32: Cross-domain problem solving
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C005, MA-Y2-C008, MA-Y2-C002, MA-Y2-C021
**Type:** Consolidation / application

A problem-solving lesson that deliberately crosses domain boundaries. Problems include: "I think of a number. I add 25 and get 61. What was my number?" (inverse, C007); "Three children each have some 5p coins. Ali has 4 coins, Ben has 6 coins, Cara has 2 coins. How much do they have altogether?" (times tables C008, then addition of three numbers C005); "Put these numbers in order: 45, 54, 38, 83" (place value C002, ordering C003). Include a pattern investigation: "What do you notice about the answers to the 5 times table and the 10 times table?" Children work in mixed-attainment pairs. This lesson highlights the connections between domains that the curated clusters did not make.

**Key vocabulary:** problem, solve, strategy, reason, explain, show, prove, notice, because

---

### Lesson 33: End-of-unit assessment and reflection
**Concepts:** All (MA-Y2-C001 through C021)
**Type:** Assessment

A full written assessment covering all three domains (25 questions, 30 minutes). Sections: (A) Place value and ordering -- 5 questions; (B) Addition and subtraction -- 8 questions (including derived facts, two-digit calculations, missing numbers); (C) Multiplication and division -- 8 questions (including table recall, statements from context, commutativity); (D) Patterns and reasoning -- 4 questions. This provides summative data for reporting and identifies children needing continued support. After the assessment, a brief whole-class reflection: "What are you most proud of learning? What do you still find tricky?" This informs my planning for the next half-term.

**Key vocabulary:** (assessment -- no new vocabulary)
