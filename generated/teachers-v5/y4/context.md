# Teaching Context (from Graph)


## Domain: EN-Y4-D001 — Spoken Language
**Subject:** English | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 8-9 | **Structure:** mixed

### Curriculum Context
Spoken language at Year 4 continues to develop pupils' confidence in extended, purposeful oral communication across a range of contexts — debate, drama, explanation and presentation. Pupils are expected to articulate and justify answers, build on others' contributions in discussion, and speak with increasing awareness of audience and purpose. The statutory curriculum requires teachers to create regular, structured opportunities for sustained talk in whole-class, group and paired contexts. By Year 4, pupils should be able to organise spoken contributions coherently, use appropriate vocabulary for different contexts, and show active listening behaviours that contribute constructively to shared discussion.

### Concepts (12)

#### EN-Y4-C001 — Active listening and appropriate response
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils listen and respond appropriately to adults and their peers in Year 4, demonstrating sustained and attentive listening across formal and informal contexts with increasing independence

**Teaching guidance:** Build on Year 3 listening by requiring children to listen to more extended and complex speech — longer teacher explanations, class debates and oral presentations by peers. Teach children to listen for the main point and supporting details, and to respond by summarising what they heard before adding their own contribution. Use the response frame: 'What I heard you say was... and I would add...' Practise listening to audio recordings and news reports as well as live speech.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may appear attentive but only process the last thing said, missing the overall argument or explanation. They may respond to what they want to talk about rather than what was actually said. Some children interrupt rather than waiting for the speaker to finish because they fear forgetting their point.

**Key vocabulary:** active listening, respond, summarise, main point, detail, appropriate, contribution, follow up, paraphrase

#### EN-Y4-C002 — Questioning to extend understanding
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils formulate and ask relevant questions that deepen their understanding of topics and texts, including questions that probe beyond surface meaning

**Teaching guidance:** Teach children to formulate questions that deepen learning, moving beyond factual recall to analytical and evaluative questions. Use question taxonomies: 'remembering' questions (Who? What?), 'understanding' questions (Why? How?), 'applying' questions (What would happen if?), and 'evaluating' questions (Do you agree? Was it fair?). Model generating higher-order questions during shared reading. Encourage children to ask questions that do not have a single right answer but invite discussion and exploration.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may confuse genuine questions with rhetorical ones. They often default to lower-order factual questions rather than analytical or evaluative ones. Some children ask questions that are too broad ('Why is reading important?') rather than specific and answerable. Others may feel embarrassed to ask questions that reveal gaps in their understanding.

**Key vocabulary:** question, enquiry, why, how, what if, evaluate, analyse, deeper, understanding, explore, investigate

#### EN-Y4-C003 — Vocabulary building strategies
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils use a range of strategies to build their vocabulary, including using dictionaries, word families, etymology and morphology, discussion and reading widely

**Teaching guidance:** Develop vocabulary-building strategies with greater independence in Year 4. Teach children to use morphological analysis (breaking words into roots, prefixes and suffixes), context clues (what surrounding words suggest), etymology (word origins), and dictionary/thesaurus use to build and refine their vocabulary. Introduce academic and subject-specific vocabulary through cross-curricular learning. Encourage children to notice and collect interesting or unfamiliar words in a vocabulary journal and use them in speech and writing.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may know a word's general meaning but not its precise or nuanced usage, leading to incorrect or awkward word choices. They may not transfer vocabulary learned in one subject to another. Some children rely solely on the teacher to explain new words rather than using independent strategies.

**Key vocabulary:** vocabulary, strategy, context, morphology, etymology, synonym, define, precise, academic, subject-specific

#### EN-Y4-C004 — Articulating and justifying opinions
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils articulate and justify answers, arguments and opinions with increasing confidence and independence, providing reasoned justification for views about what they read and broader topics

**Teaching guidance:** Develop children's ability to construct sustained arguments using the structure: assertion, reason, evidence, explanation. Model argumentative talk: 'I believe that... because... For example... This shows that...' Use formal debates with motions where children must argue for or against a proposition. Teach children to anticipate counter-arguments and address them. Practise in the context of book discussions, cross-curricular topics and PSHE issues. Encourage children to qualify their arguments: 'mostly', 'often', 'in many cases'.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may state opinions as facts without providing evidence. They may use emotional appeals rather than reasoned argument ('It's not fair!' rather than explaining why). Some children cannot distinguish between a strong argument (supported by evidence) and a weak one (unsupported assertion). Others find it difficult to argue a position they do not personally hold.

**Key vocabulary:** argue, justify, opinion, evidence, reason, counter-argument, because, however, on the other hand, assert

#### EN-Y4-C005 — Structured spoken descriptions and explanations
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils give well-structured descriptions, explanations and narratives for different purposes, including for expressing feelings, adapting structure to audience and purpose

**Teaching guidance:** Teach children to give well-structured spoken descriptions and explanations with increasing detail, precision and organisation. Provide frameworks: for descriptions, use sensory categories (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste); for explanations, use sequential connectives (first, next, then, finally) and causal connectives (because, therefore, as a result). Practise explaining processes, describing events and giving presentations about topics studied. Model the use of precise, technical vocabulary when explaining subject-specific content.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may include irrelevant or excessive detail that obscures the main point. They may struggle to adapt their explanations for different levels of audience knowledge. Some children give circular explanations that repeat the question rather than answering it. Others may speak too quickly when explaining complex ideas.

**Key vocabulary:** describe, explain, detail, precise, technical, structure, sequence, because, therefore, audience, clarity

#### EN-Y4-C006 — Collaborative conversation
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils maintain attention and participate actively in collaborative conversations, staying on topic, initiating and responding to comments, and taking turns within group and whole-class contexts

**Teaching guidance:** Develop collaborative conversation skills by increasing the complexity of group tasks and the expectation for equitable participation. Teach children to take on specific roles within groups (chairperson, note-taker, reporter, timekeeper) and to manage their own group process. Use Kagan structures (think-pair-share, round robin, numbered heads together) to ensure all children contribute. Teach ground rules for collaborative discussion: listen actively, build on others' ideas, challenge ideas not people, and seek agreement where possible.

**Common misconceptions:** Groups may focus on reaching agreement quickly rather than genuinely discussing different viewpoints. One or two confident children may dominate while others disengage. Some children confuse collaboration with simply dividing tasks and working independently. Others may agree with the majority view to avoid conflict rather than contributing their genuine perspective.

**Key vocabulary:** collaborate, role, chairperson, contribute, build on, challenge, consensus, ground rules, equitable, group

#### EN-Y4-C007 — Exploratory talk
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Pupils use spoken language to develop understanding through speculating, hypothesising, imagining and exploring ideas, increasingly using talk as a tool for thinking

**Teaching guidance:** Continue developing exploratory talk by providing increasingly complex and ambiguous discussion prompts that require sustained thinking. Use 'What if?' scenarios, ethical dilemmas linked to texts, and open-ended cross-curricular questions. Teach children that exploratory talk is characterised by tentative language ('perhaps', 'I wonder', 'it could be'), building on others' ideas ('Yes, and...'), and a willingness to change one's mind. Create a classroom culture where not knowing is valued as a starting point for enquiry.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may confuse exploratory talk with unstructured chat. They may feel pressure to reach a conclusion quickly rather than allowing ideas to develop through discussion. Some children may dismiss others' tentative ideas rather than building on them. Others may be reluctant to engage in exploratory talk because they see uncertainty as weakness.

**Key vocabulary:** explore, speculate, hypothesise, tentative, perhaps, what if, I wonder, build on, change my mind, enquiry

#### EN-Y4-C008 — Audible and fluent speech with Standard English
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils speak audibly and fluently with an increasing command of Standard English, understanding when Standard English is required and beginning to distinguish it from non-Standard forms

**Teaching guidance:** Develop awareness that Standard English is expected in formal speaking contexts as well as in writing. Teach children to recognise when Standard English is appropriate (presentations, debates, speaking to unfamiliar adults) and when informal spoken language is acceptable (casual conversation, playground talk). Practise switching between registers through role-play. Focus on common non-standard forms: 'was/were' agreement, irregular past tenses, and double negatives. Continue to value dialect and home language while building bidialectal competence.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may think Standard English is 'posh' or 'not natural'. They may not realise they already switch between registers in different contexts. Some children apply Standard English rules rigidly in all contexts, losing naturalness in casual speech. Others may use Standard English in writing but revert to non-standard forms in formal speech.

**Key vocabulary:** Standard English, formal, informal, register, appropriate, spoken, correct, grammar, fluent, audible

#### EN-Y4-C009 — Spoken performance and drama
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Pupils participate in discussions, presentations, performances, role play, improvisations and debates with growing familiarity and confidence across a variety of situations, audiences and purposes, including formal presentations and debate

**Teaching guidance:** Use drama techniques to deepen understanding of texts and develop spoken language in context. Introduce more sophisticated strategies: improvisation (unscripted scenes based on a text), writing and performing short scripts, director's chair (one child directs others in a scene, making deliberate choices about voice and movement), and debate in role (arguing a character's perspective). Connect drama to writing by using drama as a pre-writing activity: children explore characters and situations physically before writing.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may focus on entertainment value rather than using drama to explore the text or develop understanding. They may find it difficult to sustain a role, breaking character when they are unsure what to say. Some children may copy film or TV performances rather than developing their own interpretation.

**Key vocabulary:** drama, improvise, script, direct, perform, character, motivation, scene, audience, interpretation

#### EN-Y4-C010 — Audience engagement
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils gain, maintain and monitor the interest of the listener(s), adjusting pace, volume, tone and vocabulary to sustain engagement

**Teaching guidance:** Teach children to maintain audience engagement during longer presentations. Model techniques: starting with a hook (a surprising fact, a question, a bold statement), organising content with clear signposts ('My first point is...', 'Moving on to...'), using visual aids or props, making eye contact around the room, and ending with a summary or call to action. Give children practice presenting to different audiences (their own class, younger children, parents). Use peer feedback focused specifically on engagement techniques.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may read directly from notes without looking up, losing connection with their audience. They may include too much detail, causing the audience to lose interest. Some children speak in a monotone, while others adopt an artificial 'presentation voice' that sounds unnatural. A few children may prioritise being entertaining over being informative.

**Key vocabulary:** audience, engage, hook, signpost, structure, visual aid, eye contact, present, conclude, interact

#### EN-Y4-C011 — Evaluating different viewpoints
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils consider and evaluate different viewpoints, attending to and building constructively on the contributions of others in discussion and debate

**Teaching guidance:** Teach children to evaluate different viewpoints by considering the strength of the reasoning and evidence behind each one. Use structured activities: present two or more contrasting viewpoints on an issue from a text and ask children to weigh the arguments for each. Teach the difference between opinion (subjective preference) and evidence-based argument (supported by facts). Model evaluating viewpoints: 'This argument is stronger because it is supported by evidence, while this one relies on emotion.' Connect to reading comprehension where characters hold different views.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may equate the viewpoint they agree with as the 'right' one rather than evaluating the quality of reasoning. They may dismiss viewpoints they disagree with without engaging with the argument. Some children struggle to understand that a well-argued position can still be wrong, and a poorly argued position can still be correct.

**Key vocabulary:** viewpoint, evaluate, evidence, argument, strong, weak, bias, fair, balanced, perspective, reason, weigh

#### EN-Y4-C012 — Register and audience awareness
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils select and use appropriate registers for effective communication, with a growing understanding of formal and informal language use and Standard versus non-Standard English

**Teaching guidance:** Develop register awareness by exploring how language changes depending on audience, purpose and context. Compare formal and informal versions of the same message (a text to a friend vs a letter to the head teacher). Teach that register involves vocabulary choice, sentence structure, tone and level of detail. Use role-play to practise speaking in different registers. In writing, connect register to text type: an email to a friend uses different register from a formal letter or a newspaper report. Model making deliberate register choices during shared writing.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may think formal register means using long, complicated words, when it actually involves a combination of vocabulary, grammar and tone. They may not adjust their register for written texts, writing in an informal, chatty style for all purposes. Some children equate formality with unfriendliness.

**Key vocabulary:** register, formal, informal, audience, purpose, tone, vocabulary, appropriate, context, adjust, language

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**EN-Y4-D001-CL001:**
- **Evidence and Argument** (primary): What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Relevant questioning and building vocabulary through listening position the pupil as an active processor of others' spoken contributions, using what has been said as evidence for how to respond and what vocabulary matters.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'
- **Perspective and Interpretation**: Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?
  Why: Active listening requires tracking the speaker's perspective; vocabulary building in discussion involves recognising that word choices signal viewpoint as well as meaning.
  AI instruction: Use the PERSPECTIVE AND INTERPRETATION lens: prompt pupils to identify the author's or actor's viewpoint, consider what information or experience shapes that perspective, look for omissions or contradictions, and compare multiple accounts. Useful questions: 'Who wrote/said this, and why?', 'What might they have left out?', 'How would someone else see this differently?', 'What would change your view?'

**EN-Y4-D001-CL002:**
- **Evidence and Argument** (primary): What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Articulating and justifying opinions requires pupils to construct a claim-plus-reason structure — the cognitive demand is building a spoken argument that others can evaluate.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'
- **Perspective and Interpretation**: Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?
  Why: Engaging audiences and collaborative conversation require pupils to anticipate how contributions will be received by others, which is a perspectival judgement about listener needs and responses.
  AI instruction: Use the PERSPECTIVE AND INTERPRETATION lens: prompt pupils to identify the author's or actor's viewpoint, consider what information or experience shapes that perspective, look for omissions or contradictions, and compare multiple accounts. Useful questions: 'Who wrote/said this, and why?', 'What might they have left out?', 'How would someone else see this differently?', 'What would change your view?'

**EN-Y4-D001-CL003:**
- **Perspective and Interpretation** (primary): Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?
  Why: Evaluating different viewpoints and register/audience awareness are both perspectival skills — pupils must recognise that different contexts, audiences and positions call for different spoken approaches.
  AI instruction: Use the PERSPECTIVE AND INTERPRETATION lens: prompt pupils to identify the author's or actor's viewpoint, consider what information or experience shapes that perspective, look for omissions or contradictions, and compare multiple accounts. Useful questions: 'Who wrote/said this, and why?', 'What might they have left out?', 'How would someone else see this differently?', 'What would change your view?'
- **Evidence and Argument**: What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Exploratory talk involves testing ideas against each other and spoken performance requires pupils to support claims about texts with oral reasoning — both are forms of collaborative evidence-based argumentation.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'

## Domain: EN-Y4-D002 — Reading - Word Reading
**Subject:** English | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 8-9 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Reading — word reading at Year 4 consolidates automatic decoding so that pupils can read most words, including those with more complex morphology, without conscious attention. Pupils are expected to understand that many words have been borrowed from other languages and carry the spelling patterns of their language of origin — Latin, French, Greek — and to use this knowledge to tackle unfamiliar vocabulary in academic texts. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to continue to apply their phonic knowledge and skill to read aloud and to understand new words encountered in their independent reading. Year 4 is a crucial year for closing any remaining gaps in decoding fluency so that comprehension, rather than decoding, becomes the primary challenge in reading.

### Concepts (3)

#### EN-Y4-C013 — Root words for reading and meaning
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils apply growing knowledge of root words alongside etymology and morphology to read aloud and comprehend new words, supporting vocabulary development rather than decoding alone

**Teaching guidance:** Build on Year 3 root word knowledge by introducing Latin and Greek roots found in subject-specific vocabulary across the curriculum. Examples: 'aqua' (water), 'bio' (life), 'geo' (earth), 'port' (carry), 'rupt' (break), 'struct' (build), 'tele' (far). Use word webs to show how a single root generates multiple words. When encountering unfamiliar vocabulary in science, geography or history, prompt children to identify the root word and use it to infer meaning. Create class root word collections for each subject area.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may not connect root word knowledge to reading comprehension, treating it as a separate spelling activity. They may misidentify root words in words that are not etymologically related (e.g., thinking 'television' and 'telephone' share the root 'tel' when the actual root is 'tele-'). Some children memorise roots without understanding how to apply them to new vocabulary.

**Key vocabulary:** root word, Latin, Greek, origin, word family, meaning, derive, vocabulary, subject-specific, infer

#### EN-Y4-C014 — Prefixes and suffixes for reading (etymology and morphology)
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 2

Pupils apply knowledge of a wide range of prefixes and suffixes (as listed in English Appendix 1) both to read aloud and to understand the meaning of new words, testing different pronunciations for longer words

**Teaching guidance:** Extend prefix and suffix knowledge to support reading of unfamiliar vocabulary. Year 4 prefixes include: in-/im-/il-/ir- (meaning 'not': inactive, impossible, illegal, irregular), inter- (between: interact, international), and further practice with un-, dis-, mis-, re-. Year 4 suffixes include: -ation (information), -ous (famous), -ly (happily), -er/-or (teacher, inventor). Teach children to decode unfamiliar words in reading by identifying the prefix or suffix and the root word. Model this process during shared reading across all subjects.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may not realise that in-, im-, il- and ir- are all variants of the same 'not' prefix, applied depending on the initial letter of the root word. They may strip affixes from words that are not actually prefixed (e.g., thinking 'improve' has the prefix 'im-'). Some children can identify affixes but do not use this knowledge to work out the meaning of unfamiliar words.

**Key vocabulary:** prefix, suffix, morphology, in-, im-, il-, ir-, inter-, -ation, -ous, root word, decode, meaning

#### EN-Y4-C015 — Exception words (Years 3-4)
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils read further exception words from the Years 3-4 statutory list, noting the unusual correspondences between spelling and sound and where these occur in words

**Teaching guidance:** Continue practising the Years 3-4 statutory word list words throughout Year 4, focusing on those that children still find challenging. Use a range of strategies: look-say-cover-write-check, dictation in sentence contexts, word sorts by common patterns, mnemonics for particularly tricky words, and regular assessment. Focus on words that appear frequently in cross-curricular writing. Encourage children to self-monitor their spelling of exception words in independent writing and correct errors using dictionaries.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may be able to spell exception words in isolation (on a spelling test) but revert to phonetic spelling in independent writing. They may confuse similar-looking words (e.g., 'thought', 'though', 'through', 'thorough'). Some children assume that once they pass a spelling test on these words, they never need to practise them again.

**Key vocabulary:** exception word, statutory word, spelling, practise, remember, dictation, pattern, tricky, self-correct

Rationale: Root words, prefixes/suffixes for reading (etymology and morphology), and exception words from Y3-4 form the complete word reading curriculum for Y4; C013 lists C014 in co_teach_hints.
Inspired by: CC ELA RF.4.3a - Use combined knowledge of all letter-sound correspondences to decode words

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**EN-Y4-D002-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Morphological and etymological analysis is a pattern-application strategy: pupils use the systematic structure of roots, prefixes and suffixes as clues that generalise across all words sharing those elements.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Structure and Function**: How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Understanding why words are structured as they are (etymology) and how those structures produce meaning (morphology) is a direct application of structure-function thinking to vocabulary.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'

### Objectives (2)
- EN-Y4-O013 [statutory]: apply their growing knowledge of root words, prefixes and suffixes (etymology and morphology) as listed in English Appendix 1, both to read aloud and to understand the meaning of new words they meet
- EN-Y4-O014 [statutory]: read further exception words, noting the unusual correspondences between spelling and sound, and where these occur in the word

### Content Vehicles — Teaching Packs (1)
These are choosable teaching packs that deliver concepts in this domain. Teachers select the pack that fits their class.

#### EN-Y4-CV007 — Spelling and Vocabulary: Word Detective (text_study)

Writing outcome: Spelling log with word families, rules, and corrections applied in extended writing
Grammar focus: prefixes and suffixes spelling rules, suffix doubling rules, homophones
Key vocabulary: prefix, suffix, root word, etymology, homophone, word family, syllable, consonant, vowel
Assessment: Can pupils apply prefix and suffix rules to spell unfamiliar words? Can they use a dictionary effectively to check spellings and meanings? Can they distinguish homophones in context? Can they spell words from the Y3-4 statutory list?
Success criteria: Apply prefix and suffix rules to spell words correctly; Use a dictionary to check spellings and find meanings; Distinguish common homophones (there/their/they're, etc.) in context; Spell the majority of the Y3-4 statutory word list correctly

## Domain: EN-Y4-D003 — Reading - Comprehension
**Subject:** English | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 8-9 | **Structure:** mixed

### Curriculum Context
Reading comprehension at Year 4 expects pupils to read with developing independence, selecting and discussing books across a range of genres including fiction, poetry and information texts. Pupils develop skills of inference and deduction — reading between the lines to understand characters' motivations, the significance of events, and the effect of authorial choices. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to discuss words and phrases that capture their interest or imagination, to make comparisons within and across books, and to prepare poems and play scripts to read aloud and perform with appropriate intonation and volume. Comprehension is developed both through shared reading of challenging texts read aloud by the teacher and through pupils' independent reading of texts chosen for themselves.

### Concepts (18)

#### EN-Y4-C016 — Wide reading for positive attitudes
Type: attitude | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Pupils develop positive attitudes to reading through listening to and discussing a wide range of fiction, poetry, plays, non-fiction, reference books and textbooks, including books and authors they would not choose themselves

**Teaching guidance:** Foster positive attitudes to reading by ensuring access to a wide range of engaging texts, including books chosen by children, texts recommended by peers and adults, and texts representing diverse voices and experiences. Maintain daily independent reading time with teacher conferencing. Create a reading community through book clubs, author visits, library visits and reading challenges. Model your own reading habits: share what you are reading and why. Avoid linking reading to extrinsic rewards (stickers, prizes) that can undermine intrinsic motivation.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may equate reading ability with reading enjoyment, and those who find reading difficult may develop negative attitudes. Some children read only one genre or author and resist exploring new territory. Others may report enjoying reading but not actually read independently, suggesting their attitudes have not translated into habits.

**Key vocabulary:** reading for pleasure, attitude, enjoy, choice, recommend, wide reading, author, genre, motivation, engage

#### EN-Y4-C017 — Reading for different purposes and structures
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils read books structured in different ways and read for a range of purposes including pleasure and information, understanding how text structure serves its purpose

**Teaching guidance:** Teach children to read for different purposes and to recognise how text structure supports purpose. Study how different types of texts are structured: chronological texts (recounts, instructions, narratives), non-chronological texts (reports, explanations, discussion texts), and reference texts (dictionaries, encyclopaedias, websites). Teach children to identify the purpose of a text and to select the appropriate reading strategy: reading for gist (skimming), reading for specific information (scanning), or reading for deep understanding (close reading).

**Common misconceptions:** Children may read all texts at the same pace and with the same approach regardless of purpose. They may not recognise that the same topic can be presented in different text structures for different purposes. Some children struggle to switch between reading strategies, defaulting to reading everything from start to finish.

**Key vocabulary:** purpose, structure, chronological, non-chronological, skim, scan, close reading, text type, audience, form

#### EN-Y4-C018 — Dictionary use for reading comprehension
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils use dictionaries to check the meaning of words they have read, efficiently using alphabetical order and knowledge of first two or three letters

**Teaching guidance:** Develop efficient dictionary use in Year 4, building speed and independence. Teach children to use guide words at the top of dictionary pages to navigate quickly. When a word has multiple meanings, teach children to read all definitions and select the one that fits the context. Introduce the practice of checking pronunciation using the dictionary's pronunciation guide. Encourage dictionary use as a habit during independent reading — children should have dictionaries accessible whenever they read.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may look up a word but select the wrong definition because they do not consider the context. They may find dictionary use too slow and skip unfamiliar words instead. Some children rely on the dictionary for every unfamiliar word rather than using context first and the dictionary to confirm.

**Key vocabulary:** dictionary, definition, guide word, meaning, context, pronunciation, alphabetical, entry, look up, check

#### EN-Y4-C019 — Fairy stories, myths and legends
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Pupils increase familiarity with fairy stories, myths and legends from a range of traditions and retell some of these orally, recognising common themes such as triumph of good over evil and use of magical devices

**Teaching guidance:** Extend knowledge of fairy stories, myths and legends through texts from diverse cultural traditions. In Year 4, deepen analysis: compare versions of the same story from different cultures (e.g., Cinderella variants from around the world), discuss how myths reflect the values and beliefs of the culture that produced them, and explore how legends blend fact and fiction. Teach children to recognise structural patterns: the hero's journey, the quest, the transformation, the trickster tale. Use as models for children's own narrative writing.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may assume that myths from other cultures are simply 'wrong explanations' rather than understanding their cultural significance. They may think that all versions of a traditional story must be the same and be surprised by cultural variations. Some children struggle to see how mythological structures are still used in modern storytelling.

**Key vocabulary:** fairy story, myth, legend, culture, tradition, hero, quest, moral, origin story, variant, pattern

#### EN-Y4-C020 — Themes and conventions in books
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils identify themes and conventions in a wide range of books, recognising recurring themes in fiction and genre conventions in different types of writing (e.g. greeting in letters, first-person diary, presentational devices in instructions)

**Teaching guidance:** Deepen children's ability to identify and discuss themes and conventions in books read during the year. Teach children to track a theme across a whole text, noting how it is introduced, developed and resolved. Use a theme-tracking grid where children record evidence from different parts of the text. Compare themes across texts by the same author or within the same genre. Teach conventions of specific genres: the detective story (clues, red herrings, suspects, resolution), the adventure story (danger, courage, journey, return), the school story (friendships, conflicts, growing up).

**Common misconceptions:** Children may identify themes at a surface level ('it's about animals') rather than at a deeper level ('it's about loyalty'). They may confuse a theme with a moral or lesson. Some children can identify themes when prompted but do not notice them independently during reading.

**Key vocabulary:** theme, convention, genre, evidence, track, develop, compare, pattern, feature, detective, adventure

#### EN-Y4-C021 — Poetry and play performance
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Pupils prepare poems and play scripts to read aloud and perform, showing understanding through intonation, tone, volume and action, using drama to explore meaning and comprehension

**Teaching guidance:** Provide regular, purposeful opportunities for children to prepare and perform poems and play scripts. In Year 4, increase expectations for performance quality: appropriate use of tone, volume, pace, emphasis, pause, gesture and movement. Teach children to analyse a text before performing it, making deliberate choices about how to convey meaning and mood. Use group performance to develop ensemble skills — reading in unison, splitting parts, using dramatic pauses. Connect to writing by having children write their own scripts and poems for performance.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may prioritise volume over expression, thinking that speaking loudly equals performing well. They may not understand that performance choices should be driven by the meaning of the text. Some children memorise texts mechanically without understanding them deeply enough to perform expressively.

**Key vocabulary:** perform, rehearse, script, poem, expression, tone, emphasis, pause, gesture, movement, ensemble

#### EN-Y4-C022 — Effective language in texts
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Pupils discuss words and phrases that capture the reader's interest and imagination, extending their interest in the meaning and origin of words

**Teaching guidance:** Develop children's ability to analyse how authors use language for effect. Move beyond identifying individual powerful words to discussing how language choices work together to create mood, atmosphere, character and setting. Teach children to notice patterns in an author's language use: do they use short sentences for tension? Figurative language for description? Formal vocabulary for authority? Use close reading activities where children annotate short passages, highlighting language features and commenting on their effect.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may comment on language as 'good writing' without explaining what makes it effective. They may focus on individual words rather than how language features work together. Some children can identify language features (simile, metaphor, alliteration) but cannot explain their effect on the reader.

**Key vocabulary:** language, effect, author, choice, mood, atmosphere, figurative, imagery, technique, analyse, create, purpose

#### EN-Y4-C023 — Forms of poetry
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils recognise some different forms of poetry and their characteristics, including free verse and narrative poetry

**Teaching guidance:** Extend knowledge of poetry forms by introducing narrative poetry, ballads, sonnets (read not written), limericks, and concrete/shape poems alongside the forms introduced in Year 3. Read and perform a wide range of poetry throughout the year, not just during a 'poetry unit'. Teach children to appreciate how the form of a poem shapes its content — a haiku demands compression, a limerick demands humour, a narrative poem tells a story. Encourage children to experiment with different forms in their own writing.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may believe that poetry must follow strict rules and that deviation from a pattern is 'wrong' rather than a creative choice. They may think that learning about poetry forms is about following templates rather than understanding how form shapes meaning. Some children may feel poetry is exclusively a KS1 activity and resist engaging with it.

**Key vocabulary:** poem, form, narrative poem, ballad, limerick, sonnet, concrete poem, rhythm, rhyme scheme, stanza

#### EN-Y4-C024 — Comprehension monitoring
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils check that text makes sense to them, discussing their understanding and explaining the meaning of words in context, re-reading when meaning breaks down

**Teaching guidance:** Strengthen comprehension monitoring in Year 4 by teaching children to deploy a wider range of fix-up strategies independently. Teach the hierarchy: reread the sentence, read on to see if meaning becomes clear, use context to infer the meaning of unfamiliar words, break down unfamiliar words into roots and affixes, check a dictionary or glossary, and ask a peer or adult. Use think-aloud activities in guided reading to model metacognitive awareness: 'I noticed I lost track of what was happening here, so I...' Encourage children to annotate texts with question marks where they are confused.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may continue reading past points of confusion without noticing the breakdown in comprehension. They may rely on a single fix-up strategy (usually rereading) without trying alternatives. Some children monitor word-level accuracy but not overall text-level meaning.

**Key vocabulary:** comprehension, monitor, strategy, reread, context, infer, check, fix up, meaning, metacognition

#### EN-Y4-C025 — Questions to improve reading comprehension
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils ask questions to improve their understanding of a text, developing, agreeing on and evaluating rules for effective discussion, with expectation that all pupils take part

**Teaching guidance:** Teach questioning as a deep reading strategy, not just a comprehension exercise. Model generating questions at different levels: literal (What happened?), inferential (Why did the character...?), evaluative (Was this the right decision?), and authorial (Why did the writer choose to...?). Use reciprocal reading groups where children take turns as the 'questioner'. Teach children to distinguish between questions the text answers, questions the reader must infer answers to, and questions the text leaves deliberately unanswered.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may generate only literal recall questions rather than questions that promote deeper thinking. They may see questioning as something done to test comprehension rather than as a strategy to deepen it. Some children ask questions without attempting to answer them, treating questioning as an end in itself.

**Key vocabulary:** question, literal, inferential, evaluative, author, purpose, explore, discuss, higher-order, think

#### EN-Y4-C026 — Drawing inferences with evidence
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils draw inferences such as inferring characters' feelings, thoughts and motives from their actions, and justify inferences with evidence from the text

**Teaching guidance:** Develop inference skills in Year 4 by requiring children to use more precise textual evidence and to make more complex inferences about characters' feelings, motivations, and relationships. Teach children to consider what is deliberately left unsaid as well as what is stated. Use the inference equation: clues from the text + reader's knowledge = inference. Teach children to support their inferences with multiple pieces of evidence, not just one quote. Practise with increasingly subtle texts where meaning must be constructed rather than found.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may make inferences that are plausible but unsupported by the text. They may over-rely on personal experience rather than textual evidence. Some children state inferences without providing evidence, while others provide evidence without explaining what it shows. The most common error is confusing inference with retrieval.

**Key vocabulary:** infer, evidence, clue, motive, feeling, suggest, imply, deduce, multiple, justify, prove, show

#### EN-Y4-C027 — Prediction from stated and implied detail
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils predict what might happen from details stated and implied in the text, using explicit and implicit clues to make reasoned predictions

**Teaching guidance:** Develop prediction skills by requiring children to draw on both explicit and implicit information from the text. Teach children to use their knowledge of text structures and genre conventions to inform predictions: 'This is a detective story, so I expect the detective will find a clue soon.' Encourage children to make several predictions and to weigh which is most likely based on available evidence. After reading on, discuss which predictions were confirmed and what textual signals were helpful or misleading.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may rely on genre knowledge alone without attending to the specific details of the text. They may make predictions based on what they want to happen rather than what the evidence suggests. Some children abandon predictions too quickly when they encounter new information rather than weighing it against existing evidence.

**Key vocabulary:** predict, evidence, stated, implied, likely, because, genre, convention, confirm, revise, expect

#### EN-Y4-C028 — Identifying and summarising main ideas across paragraphs
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils identify main ideas drawn from more than one paragraph and summarise these, demonstrating ability to synthesise information across extended texts

**Teaching guidance:** Teach summarising across paragraphs — identifying the main idea of each paragraph and then synthesising these into an overall summary of the text or section. Use the strategy of writing a one-sentence summary for each paragraph, then combining these into a coherent summary of the whole text. Teach children to distinguish between essential information and supporting detail. Practise with both fiction (summarising the key events and themes) and non-fiction (summarising the main argument or information). Set word limits to force conciseness.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often struggle to summarise across multiple paragraphs, producing paragraph-by-paragraph retellings rather than integrated summaries. They may include minor details while omitting key information. Some children write summaries that are nearly as long as the original text. Others may summarise the beginning in detail but rush through the middle and end.

**Key vocabulary:** summarise, main idea, key events, paragraph, overall, essential, detail, concise, synthesise, gist

#### EN-Y4-C029 — Language, structure and presentation contributing to meaning
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Pupils identify how language, structure and presentation contribute to meaning, understanding how authors use these features to shape reader response

**Teaching guidance:** Deepen children's understanding of how language, structure and presentational features contribute to meaning. In fiction, analyse how authors use short sentences for tension, long sentences for description, dialogue for characterisation, and structural features (chapters, flashbacks, multiple narrators) to shape the reader's experience. In non-fiction, examine how headings, bullet points, diagrams, photographs with captions, and text boxes enhance understanding. Compare texts that present similar content with different structural and presentational choices.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may describe structural features without explaining their effect on the reader. They may not connect an author's structural choices to their purpose (e.g., not understanding why a mystery novel withholds information). Some children treat non-fiction presentational features as decorative rather than functional.

**Key vocabulary:** language, structure, presentation, effect, author's choice, technique, layout, text feature, purpose, audience

#### EN-Y4-C030 — Retrieving and recording information from non-fiction
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Pupils retrieve and record information from non-fiction, knowing what information they need before beginning and using contents pages and indexes to locate it efficiently

**Teaching guidance:** Develop retrieval and recording skills by teaching children to research more complex questions that require information from multiple sources or multiple sections of a text. Teach note-taking strategies: key words, abbreviations, tables and grids for comparing information, and paraphrasing in own words. Emphasise that recording information is not the same as copying text. Model how to cross-reference information from different sources and how to identify when sources disagree. Connect to cross-curricular research projects.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may copy chunks of text rather than selecting and paraphrasing key information. They may not check whether information from different sources is consistent. Some children record all information they find rather than selecting what is relevant to their research question. Others may accept all written information as factual without considering the source.

**Key vocabulary:** retrieve, record, research, note-taking, paraphrase, source, key words, cross-reference, compare, non-fiction

#### EN-Y4-C031 — Discussion about books
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Pupils participate in discussion about both books read to them and those they read independently, taking turns, listening to others, and with expectation that all pupils contribute

**Teaching guidance:** Develop the quality and depth of book discussions in Year 4. Teach children to support their views with evidence from the text, to compare texts with each other, and to consider alternative interpretations. Use Aidan Chambers' 'Tell Me' framework: 'What did you like? What puzzled you? What patterns or connections did you notice?' Provide time for both partner discussions and whole-class conversations about books. Encourage children to recommend books to each other with specific reasons. Teach the difference between sharing a personal response and making a critical judgement about a text.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may retell the plot as their primary response rather than sharing personal reactions, interpretations or evaluations. They may be reluctant to disagree with peers or the teacher about a text. Some children think there is one 'right' interpretation of a text that the teacher knows and they must discover.

**Key vocabulary:** discuss, respond, interpret, evidence, compare, recommend, critical, opinion, perspective, justify, text

#### EN-Y4-C064 — Justifying views about reading independently
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Pupils increasingly justify their views about what they have read independently by end of Year 4, having developed from supported justification at the start of Year 3 to full independence

**Teaching guidance:** Teach children to justify their views about books with increasing independence and specificity. Encourage children to go beyond 'I liked it because it was exciting' to explain what specifically made it exciting: character development, plot twists, descriptive language, relatable themes. Use book review frameworks that prompt children to evaluate specific aspects: character, setting, plot, language, themes, and overall impact. Teach children to support their views with direct reference to or quotation from the text.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may give vague evaluative statements ('It was good') without specific justification. They may evaluate books purely on plot (whether they liked what happened) without considering the quality of writing, characterisation or themes. Some children find it difficult to explain why they did not enjoy a book without simply saying 'it was boring'.

**Key vocabulary:** justify, opinion, evidence, review, recommend, character, plot, theme, language, effective, because, quote

#### EN-Y4-C065 — Silent reading with understanding
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Pupils read silently with good understanding, applying all comprehension strategies independently, and developing stamina for sustained independent reading

**Teaching guidance:** Continue developing silent reading stamina and comprehension in Year 4. Extend sustained silent reading periods to 15-20 minutes. Teach children to set a reading purpose before starting: 'I'm going to find out about...', 'I want to know what happens to...' Monitor silent reading comprehension through brief partner discussions, reading journals or teacher conferences. Ensure children are reading texts at an appropriate level — challenging enough to develop skills but not so difficult that comprehension breaks down. Teach children to self-select books at the right level.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may appear to be reading silently but actually be disengaged, turning pages without processing meaning. Some children choose books that are too easy because they are familiar and comfortable, missing opportunities for growth. Others choose books that are too difficult because of peer pressure or the status associated with thick books, and comprehension suffers.

**Key vocabulary:** silent reading, independent, sustained, comprehension, focus, concentrate, appropriate level, purpose, engage

  Domain: EN-Y4-D006 (Writing - Composition)
  Reason: parallel_concept
  Rationale: Okonkwo: 'Children who can discuss books critically can evaluate writing critically.' Justifying views about texts (reading) and evaluating own writing (writing) are the same critical thinking skill applied in different directions.

  Domain: SC-KS2-D007 (Living Things and Their Habitats)
  Reason: feeds_into
  Rationale: Kapoor + Okonkwo: Science environmental change concepts use non-fiction texts as source material. English 'retrieving information from non-fiction' (C030) is the literacy skill that enables science reading comprehension.

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**EN-Y4-D003-CL001:**
- **Perspective and Interpretation** (primary): Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?
  Why: Reading for different purposes across a range of texts develops pupils' awareness that different reading stances are required — reading fiction requires interpretation of character and theme while non-fiction reading requires evaluation of evidence.
  AI instruction: Use the PERSPECTIVE AND INTERPRETATION lens: prompt pupils to identify the author's or actor's viewpoint, consider what information or experience shapes that perspective, look for omissions or contradictions, and compare multiple accounts. Useful questions: 'Who wrote/said this, and why?', 'What might they have left out?', 'How would someone else see this differently?', 'What would change your view?'
- **Continuity and Change Over Time**: What has stayed the same, what has changed, and what drove that change?
  Why: Developing positive reading attitudes and silent reading stamina are cumulative outcomes that develop through sustained practice over time — the cluster is about gradual change in reader identity and capability.
  AI instruction: Use the CONTINUITY AND CHANGE OVER TIME lens: prompt pupils to construct timelines, identify turning points, distinguish what changed from what persisted, and explain what drove change. Useful questions: 'What was the same before and after?', 'What was the turning point?', 'Was this a sudden change or a gradual shift?', 'Who or what drove this change?'

**EN-Y4-D003-CL002:**
- **Perspective and Interpretation** (primary): Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?
  Why: Identifying themes, conventions and effective language requires pupils to read as an analyst of authorial choice — they ask why the author selected this form, these words, this structure, which is a perspectival interpretation task.
  AI instruction: Use the PERSPECTIVE AND INTERPRETATION lens: prompt pupils to identify the author's or actor's viewpoint, consider what information or experience shapes that perspective, look for omissions or contradictions, and compare multiple accounts. Useful questions: 'Who wrote/said this, and why?', 'What might they have left out?', 'How would someone else see this differently?', 'What would change your view?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Literary forms (fairy tale, myth, play), poetic conventions and genre themes are recurring textual patterns that pupils learn to recognise across multiple texts as reusable analytical categories.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**EN-Y4-D003-CL003:**
- **Evidence and Argument** (primary): What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Justifying views independently with textual evidence is the defining cognitive demand — pupils must not only interpret but also construct and communicate a text-grounded argument for their reading.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'
- **Perspective and Interpretation**: Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?
  Why: Drawing inferences from stated and implied information, and making predictions, both require pupils to reconstruct characters' motivations or authors' intentions — fundamentally perspectival reasoning.
  AI instruction: Use the PERSPECTIVE AND INTERPRETATION lens: prompt pupils to identify the author's or actor's viewpoint, consider what information or experience shapes that perspective, look for omissions or contradictions, and compare multiple accounts. Useful questions: 'Who wrote/said this, and why?', 'What might they have left out?', 'How would someone else see this differently?', 'What would change your view?'

**EN-Y4-D003-CL004:**
- **Evidence and Argument** (primary): What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Summarising main ideas across paragraphs and retrieving from non-fiction require pupils to identify the most evidentially significant information in a text and organise it coherently.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'
- **Structure and Function**: How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Analysing how language and structure contribute to meaning is an explicit structure-function task — pupils examine how specific textual choices (word selection, paragraph order, layout) serve the author's communicative purpose.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'

## Domain: EN-Y4-D004 — Writing - Transcription (Spelling)
**Subject:** English | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 8-9 | **Structure:** sequential

### Curriculum Context
Writing — transcription: spelling at Year 4 deepens pupils' mastery of spelling patterns and requires them to accurately apply the Year 3/4 statutory word list in their writing. Pupils learn further morphological patterns including the possessive apostrophe with plural nouns, the use of 'ough' letter strings, and the spelling of words with the 'k' sound spelt 'ch'. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to spell correctly a wider range of homophones and commonly confused words, and to use a dictionary and thesaurus to check and enhance their writing. Year 4 spelling instruction continues to require regular opportunities to investigate word patterns, test and apply spellings in writing, and revisit previously taught patterns.

### Concepts (8)

#### EN-Y4-C032 — Prefixes and suffixes spelling rules
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Pupils apply spelling rules for adding further prefixes and suffixes to root words as specified in English Appendix 1 for Years 3-4, with understanding of how they change meaning

**Teaching guidance:** Consolidate and extend prefix and suffix spelling rules taught in Year 3. Year 4 adds the prefixes in-, il-, im-, ir- (all meaning 'not'), teaching the rule that the prefix changes to match the initial letter of the root word: illegal (not legal), immature (not mature), irregular (not regular), insecure (not secure). For suffixes, practise the -ation ending (where the root changes: inform → information, explore → exploration) and the -ous ending (fame → famous, danger → dangerous). Use word-sorting activities to consolidate patterns.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may apply the wrong variant of the 'not' prefix (e.g., writing 'inlegal' instead of 'illegal' or 'inresponsible' instead of 'irresponsible'). They may not recognise that all four prefixes (in-, il-, im-, ir-) share the same meaning. Some children double or omit letters at the junction of prefix and root word.

**Key vocabulary:** prefix, suffix, spelling rule, in-, il-, im-, ir-, -ation, -ous, root word, change, pattern, not

#### EN-Y4-C033 — Suffix doubling rules for polysyllabic words
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Pupils apply the rule for doubling the final consonant in stressed syllables before vowel suffixes (forgetting, preferred, beginning) and not doubling in unstressed syllables (gardening, limiting, limitation)

**Teaching guidance:** Revisit and consolidate the consonant doubling rule for polysyllabic words, as this remains a challenging area. Practise with additional examples: refer → referring, referred; occur → occurring, occurred; commit → committing, committed. Contrast with non-doubling examples: visit → visiting (unstressed final syllable); garden → gardening; listen → listening. Use sorting activities: children sort words into 'doubles' and 'doesn't double' categories and articulate the rule in their own words.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may double consonants in words where the final syllable is unstressed (e.g., 'visiting' → 'visitting'). They may not hear the difference between stressed and unstressed syllables. Some children apply the rule to words ending in two consonants (e.g., doubling in 'jumping' → 'jumpping'), where doubling never occurs because the word already ends in two consonants.

**Key vocabulary:** double consonant, suffix, stressed syllable, -ing, -ed, -er, polysyllabic, rule, pattern, one vowel

#### EN-Y4-C034 — Homophones (Years 3-4)
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Pupils correctly spell pairs and groups of homophones and near-homophones from the Years 3-4 list, including accept/except, affect/effect, brake/break, grate/great, weather/whether, whose/who's and others

**Teaching guidance:** Continue practising Years 3-4 homophones with the full list for this phase. Focus on those that cause the most errors in children's writing: there/their/they're, to/too/two, your/you're, its/it's, where/wear/were, here/hear, plain/plane, whether/weather, whose/who's, piece/peace. Teach memory aids: 'their' contains 'heir' (ownership), 'there' contains 'here' (place), 'they're' = 'they are'. Practise through cloze passages and proof-reading activities. Assess in the context of independent writing, not just spelling tests.

**Common misconceptions:** Children most commonly confuse its/it's and their/there/they're. They may spell homophones correctly on a test but use the wrong one in independent writing because they are not thinking about meaning. Some children do not understand why English has homophones or why it matters which spelling is used.

**Key vocabulary:** homophone, same sound, different spelling, meaning, context, choose, its/it's, there/their/they're, your/you're

#### EN-Y4-C035 — Spelling patterns from various etymologies
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Pupils learn specific spelling patterns from Greek, Latin and French origins: /i/ spelt y (myth, gym), /u/ spelt ou (young), -ous suffix, -sure/-ture endings, -sion/-tion/-ssion/-cian endings, ch spelt Greek-style (chorus, scheme), ch spelt French-style (chef, machine), -gue/-que endings (league, antique), sc for /s/ (science), ei/eigh/ey for /ei/ (vein, eight, obey)

**Teaching guidance:** Extend knowledge of etymological spelling patterns. In Year 4, explore how words from different languages follow different spelling conventions: the /ʃ/ sound can be spelt 'sh' (English), 'ch' (French — chef, machine), 'ti' (Latin — station, nation), 'ci' (Latin — special, official), or 'ss' (Latin — mission, discussion). Teach the /k/ sound spelt 'ch' from Greek (chorus, chemistry, character) and 'que' from French (unique, antique). Use etymology dictionaries to investigate word origins when interesting examples arise during reading.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may not connect etymology to spelling, seeing them as separate topics. They may apply English phonics rules to words of foreign origin, producing incorrect spellings. Some children find it overwhelming that one sound can have many spellings and may not see the systematic patterns based on word origin.

**Key vocabulary:** etymology, spelling pattern, origin, French, Greek, Latin, English, /ʃ/ sound, /k/ sound, language

#### EN-Y4-C036 — Years 3-4 statutory word list
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Pupils learn to spell correctly all words from the statutory Years 3-4 word list: accident, actual, address, answer, appear, arrive, believe, bicycle, breath, breathe, build, busy/business, calendar, caught, centre, century, certain, circle, complete, consider, continue, decide, describe, different, difficult, disappear, early, earth, eight/eighth, enough, exercise, experience, experiment, extreme, famous, favourite, February, forward(s), fruit, grammar, group, guard, guide, heard, heart, height, history, imagine, important, increase, interest, island, knowledge, learn, length, library, material, medicine, mention, minute, natural, naughty, notice, occasion(ally), often, opposite, ordinary, particular, peculiar, perhaps, popular, position, possess(ion), possible, potatoes, pressure, probably, promise, purpose, quarter, question, recent, regular, reign, remember, sentence, separate, special, straight, strange, strength, suppose, surprise, therefore, though/although, thought, through, various, weight, woman/women

**Teaching guidance:** Continue systematic practice of the Years 3-4 statutory word list throughout Year 4, with particular attention to words that remain difficult. Use words in sentence-level dictation to practise applying correct spelling in context. Create personal spelling logs where children record words they find challenging. Teach children to use the 'have a go' strategy — trying a word two or three ways to see which looks right — before checking in the dictionary. Connect word list practice to independent writing: children should be expected to spell these words correctly in all written work.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may treat word list practice as a separate activity from 'real' writing and not transfer correct spellings to independent work. They may spell words correctly when focusing on spelling but revert to errors when concentrating on content. Some children rely on phonetic approximations for words that require whole-word memorisation.

**Key vocabulary:** statutory word list, spelling, practise, dictation, personal log, have a go, check, correct, independent

#### EN-Y4-C037 — Possessive apostrophe with plural nouns
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Pupils place the possessive apostrophe accurately with regular plurals (girls', boys', babies') and irregular plurals (children's, men's, mice's), understanding that the apostrophe is placed after the plural form

**Teaching guidance:** Consolidate understanding of the possessive apostrophe with both singular and plural nouns. Teach the rule clearly: for singular nouns, add 's (the cat's tail); for regular plurals ending in -s, add just an apostrophe (the cats' tails); for irregular plurals not ending in -s, add 's (the children's coats). Use a three-column sorting activity where children classify possessive nouns as singular, regular plural or irregular plural. Practise in the context of sentence writing and editing activities. Address possessive apostrophe with names ending in -s (James's or James').

**Common misconceptions:** Children frequently place the apostrophe in the wrong position, writing 'the dog's' when they mean multiple dogs (the dogs'). They may add possessive apostrophes to ordinary plural nouns (e.g., 'the apple's are red'). The irregular plural possessive (children's, women's) catches out many children because it follows the singular pattern.

**Key vocabulary:** possessive apostrophe, singular, plural, regular, irregular, belongs to, ownership, apostrophe, 's, s'

#### EN-Y4-C038 — Dictionary use for spelling
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Pupils use the first two or three letters of a word to check and correct spellings in a dictionary with sufficient efficiency, supported by adequate spelling knowledge

**Teaching guidance:** Develop efficient dictionary use for checking and confirming spellings. Teach children to make a 'best guess' spelling based on their phonic and morphological knowledge, then verify using the dictionary. Teach strategies for finding words when the initial spelling guess is wrong: try alternative phoneme-grapheme correspondences (e.g., if 'nolledge' is not found, try 'knowledge'), look for related words in the same word family, and use a 'hard words to spell' list. Make dictionaries easily accessible during all writing activities.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may give up looking for a word if their first spelling attempt is not found, rather than trying alternative spellings. They may see dictionary checking as disrupting their writing flow rather than as an integral part of good writing practice. Some children always ask a peer or adult rather than developing dictionary independence.

**Key vocabulary:** dictionary, spelling, check, verify, best guess, alternative spelling, word family, confirm, look up

#### EN-Y4-C039 — Writing from dictation
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Pupils write from memory simple sentences dictated by the teacher, demonstrating secure application of all spelling and punctuation knowledge taught so far

**Teaching guidance:** Use dictation as a regular practice activity, increasing complexity from Year 3. Dictate passages of 2-3 sentences at a time, including the punctuation as spoken cues ('capital letter... full stop... new sentence... comma'). Include Years 3-4 statutory word list words, apostrophes for contraction and possession, and varied sentence structures. After dictation, children self-check against the correct version, identifying and categorising their errors (spelling, punctuation, or grammatical). Use the pattern of errors to inform future teaching.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may struggle to hold longer sentences in working memory, particularly those with subordinate clauses or multiple punctuation marks. They may focus on spelling at the expense of punctuation or vice versa. Some children transcribe what they hear phonetically rather than applying spelling rules and exception word knowledge.

**Key vocabulary:** dictation, listen, write, sentence, punctuation, spell, check, self-correct, error, accuracy, pattern

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**EN-Y4-D004-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Morphological spelling rules for prefixes and the polysyllabic doubling rule are systematic patterns — pupils must identify the word class and apply the relevant rule predictably to all new derived words they encounter.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**EN-Y4-D004-CL002:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Etymology-based patterns (French, Greek, Latin origins) and statutory word lists both encode the historical regularities that explain modern English spelling — recognising the pattern behind the spelling reduces the memorisation load.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**EN-Y4-D004-CL003:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Plural possessive apostrophe extends the KS1 apostrophe pattern to a more complex rule; dictionary use applies pattern knowledge to verify whether a spelling matches the convention.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Evidence and Argument**: What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Writing from dictation and using dictionaries to check spelling are both evidence-checking practices — pupils test their orthographic knowledge against an external standard.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'

## Domain: EN-Y4-D005 — Writing - Transcription (Handwriting)
**Subject:** English | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 8-9 | **Structure:** sequential

### Curriculum Context
Handwriting at Year 4 aims for pupils to have fully consistent, legible joined handwriting that is sufficiently automatic to support extended composition without conscious attention to letter formation. Pupils are expected to choose an appropriate presentation style for different purposes — including when it is appropriate to use print rather than joined cursive. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to increase their legibility, consistency and quality of handwriting, developing their own personalised joined style that retains legibility at speed. By Year 4, the expectation is that handwriting should no longer present a barrier to extended writing, with pupils able to write continuously and fluently for sustained periods.

### Concepts (2)

#### EN-Y4-C040 — Joining strokes in handwriting
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils use the diagonal and horizontal strokes needed to join letters and understand which letters, when adjacent, are best left unjoined, with joined handwriting used throughout independent writing

**Teaching guidance:** Continue developing fluent, consistent joined handwriting in Year 4. By this stage, most children should be joining most letters automatically. Focus on maintaining legibility while increasing writing speed. Teach children to adapt their handwriting for different purposes: quick notes can be less neat than a presentation piece. Identify and address persistent formation or joining errors through targeted individual practice. Some children may need to continue using print for specific purposes (labelling diagrams, filling in forms) while using joined writing for continuous text.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may equate fast writing with good writing, sacrificing legibility for speed. They may have persistent formation errors (often in letters r, s, k) that become harder to correct the longer they go unaddressed. Some children can write neatly in handwriting practice but produce illegible work when composing because cognitive load affects motor control.

**Key vocabulary:** joined, cursive, fluent, legible, speed, consistent, join, stroke, adapt, purpose, presentation

#### EN-Y4-C041 — Handwriting fluency and quality
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils increase the legibility, consistency and quality of their handwriting, ensuring parallel equidistant downstrokes, sufficient spacing for ascenders and descenders, and sufficient fluency to keep pace with their ideas

**Teaching guidance:** Develop handwriting fluency and quality by setting clear expectations for presentation across all written work. Teach children to evaluate their own handwriting against the school's handwriting expectations: consistent size, correct joining, clear ascenders and descenders, appropriate spacing. Use self-assessment: children circle their best line of handwriting and identify one thing to improve. Ensure that handwriting practice addresses the specific errors each child makes, rather than whole-class repetition of letter formations that most children have mastered.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may view handwriting practice as unnecessary once they can join letters, not understanding that fluency and quality require ongoing attention. They may not connect legible handwriting to effective communication — if the reader cannot read the writing, the content is lost. Some children's handwriting deteriorates significantly under time pressure (tests, timed writing).

**Key vocabulary:** fluency, quality, legible, consistent, presentation, self-assess, improve, speed, handwriting, standard

Type: practice
Concepts: EN-Y4-C040 (Joining strokes in handwriting), EN-Y4-C041 (Handwriting fluency and quality)
Rationale: Joining strokes and handwriting fluency/quality are the two complementary aspects of the Y4 handwriting curriculum — the mechanics and the quality standard — taught in tandem throughout the year.
Inspired by: CC ELA L.3.3 - Use knowledge of language conventions in writing

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**EN-Y4-D005-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Handwriting fluency at Y4 is achieved through internalising the motor patterns of joining — consistent, automatic reproduction of letter connections is a pattern-mastery goal.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

### Objectives (2)
- EN-Y4-O037 [statutory]: use the diagonal and horizontal strokes that are needed to join letters and understand which letters, when adjacent to one another, are best left unjoined
- EN-Y4-O038 [statutory]: increase the legibility, consistency and quality of their handwriting [for example, by ensuring that the downstrokes of letters are parallel and equidistant; that lines of writing are spaced sufficiently so that the ascenders and descenders of letters do not touch]

## Domain: EN-Y4-D006 — Writing - Composition
**Subject:** English | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 8-9 | **Structure:** sequential

### Curriculum Context
Writing — composition at Year 4 expects pupils to compose extended pieces of writing independently across a range of genres, using their reading as a model for effective writing. Pupils are expected to create detailed settings, characters and plot in narratives; to use organisational features, sub-headings and paragraphing in non-fiction; and to write for a range of purposes including to persuade, describe and explain. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to independently assess the effectiveness of their own writing in relation to audience and purpose, making revisions to vocabulary, grammar and punctuation to improve it. Year 4 composition work emphasises the recursive nature of writing — planning, drafting, revising and editing — as an integrated process.

### Concepts (10)

#### EN-Y4-C042 — Planning writing from model texts
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Pupils plan their writing by discussing writing similar to what they plan to write in order to understand and learn from its structure, vocabulary and grammar, considering purpose and audience

**Teaching guidance:** Teach planning as a structured process using model texts as the basis for writing. Analyse the structure of high-quality model texts together, then use that structure as a planning framework. Teach different planning formats: boxing-up grids (dividing the text into sections with notes for each), flow charts for chronological texts, mind maps for non-chronological texts, and story mountains for narratives. In Year 4, plans should include notes on vocabulary, sentence structures and text features to use, not just content.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may write plans that are too detailed, effectively writing a first draft in their plan. They may plan content but not consider structure, vocabulary or audience. Some children produce neat, elaborate plans but then deviate significantly from them during writing, suggesting that planning is not yet integrated into their writing process.

**Key vocabulary:** plan, model text, structure, boxing up, mind map, flow chart, audience, purpose, vocabulary, draft

#### EN-Y4-C043 — Generating and recording ideas
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Pupils plan writing by discussing and recording ideas, thinking aloud to explore and collect ideas before drafting

**Teaching guidance:** Develop idea-generation skills by teaching children multiple strategies: brainstorming, researching using books and appropriate websites, drawing on personal experience, exploring through drama and discussion, and reading model texts for inspiration. Teach children to select and organise ideas after generating them — not all ideas will be used, and some will be combined. Model the process of choosing the strongest ideas for a piece of writing. Use collaborative idea-generation activities where children build on each other's suggestions.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may choose the first idea they think of rather than generating multiple options and selecting the best. They may try to include every idea they generate, producing unfocused writing. Some children struggle to generate ideas independently, relying heavily on teacher prompts or peer suggestions.

**Key vocabulary:** generate, ideas, brainstorm, research, select, organise, develop, inspiration, choose, combine, record

#### EN-Y4-C044 — Oral rehearsal of sentences including dialogue
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Pupils compose and rehearse sentences orally including dialogue, progressively building a varied and rich vocabulary and an increasing range of sentence structures, understanding how writing differs from speech

**Teaching guidance:** Teach oral rehearsal of increasingly complex sentences, including sentences with dialogue. Before writing a sentence containing speech, children should rehearse the whole sentence aloud: the reporting clause, the spoken words, and the correct intonation for direct speech. In Year 4, extend to rehearsing short sequences of dialogue between characters, paying attention to how speech sounds natural and how reporting verbs affect the reader's understanding. Use talk partners for rehearsal before independent writing.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may rehearse dialogue that sounds natural in speech but loses clarity in writing because they rely on tone and context rather than explicit reporting. They may rehearse simple sentences but revert to writing more complex structures without rehearsal. Some children see oral rehearsal as childish and resist it, particularly those who are confident writers.

**Key vocabulary:** rehearse, sentence, aloud, dialogue, speech, reporting verb, intonation, partner, compose, natural

#### EN-Y4-C045 — Paragraphing in composition
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Pupils organise writing into paragraphs around a theme, grouping related sentences together, building on the introduction to paragraphs in Year 3

**Teaching guidance:** Develop paragraphing skills in Year 4 with the expectation that all extended writing is organised into paragraphs. Teach children to plan their paragraphs before writing, identifying the main point of each paragraph. In narrative, teach that paragraphs signal changes in time, place, topic or speaker. In non-fiction, teach that each paragraph develops one main idea with supporting details. Model linking paragraphs using cohesive devices: adverbials of time (later that day, meanwhile), connecting phrases (in addition, however, as a result), and pronoun reference.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may create paragraphs of very uneven length — one very long paragraph followed by several short ones. They may break paragraphs at the wrong point, splitting a single idea across two paragraphs or combining unrelated ideas in one. Some children use paragraphs in one genre (usually non-fiction) but not in another (usually narrative).

**Key vocabulary:** paragraph, organise, topic sentence, main idea, cohesion, link, adverbial, time, place, topic, speaker

#### EN-Y4-C046 — Narrative elements: setting, character and plot
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Pupils create settings, characters and plot in narratives, developing the three elements together to form coherent and engaging stories

**Teaching guidance:** Extend children's ability to develop setting, character and plot in their narrative writing. Teach setting description using sensory details: What can the character see, hear, smell, feel? Teach characterisation through action and dialogue rather than just physical description — show the reader what a character is like through what they say and do. Teach plot structures: problem → complication → climax → resolution. Model these elements in shared writing, drawing explicitly on techniques observed in class reading.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may describe characters only by appearance ('She had long brown hair') without revealing personality or motivation. They may rush through the climax of their story because they find writing tension difficult. Some children create elaborate settings but weak plots, or strong plots but flat, undeveloped characters.

**Key vocabulary:** setting, character, plot, describe, dialogue, action, tension, climax, resolution, sensory detail, show

#### EN-Y4-C047 — Organisational devices in non-narrative writing
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Pupils structure non-fiction writing using simple organisational devices such as headings and sub-headings, understanding that these serve the reader

**Teaching guidance:** Teach children to use appropriate organisational devices in non-narrative writing, matching the device to the text type and purpose. Teach when to use: headings and subheadings (information reports, explanation texts), bullet points and numbered lists (instructions, summaries), diagrams and labelled illustrations (explanations, reports), text boxes and captions (information texts), and tables (comparison texts). Model choosing and using these devices during shared writing. Study published non-fiction texts to see how professionals use organisational devices.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may use organisational devices inconsistently or inappropriately (e.g., using bullet points within a flowing explanation text). They may add devices after writing rather than using them to plan and organise content. Some children prioritise making their work look visually attractive over ensuring the devices genuinely aid the reader's understanding.

**Key vocabulary:** heading, subheading, bullet point, diagram, caption, text box, table, layout, organise, navigation

#### EN-Y4-C048 — Evaluating own and others' writing
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Pupils assess the effectiveness of their own and others' writing, identifying strengths and suggesting specific improvements, monitoring whether writing makes sense at different levels

**Teaching guidance:** Develop evaluation skills by teaching children to assess their own and others' writing against clear, text-type-specific success criteria. Model the evaluation process: read the writing, identify what meets the success criteria, identify what could be improved, and suggest specific changes. Use the 'what, so what, now what' framework: what has the writer done? Why is it effective (or not)? What specific improvement could they make? Teach children to evaluate organisation, language choices, and audience awareness, not just surface accuracy.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may focus evaluation on neatness and length rather than quality of content, structure and language. They may give vague feedback ('It's good' or 'You need to add more') rather than specific, actionable suggestions. Some children can evaluate others' writing but not their own because they cannot distance themselves from their intentions.

**Key vocabulary:** evaluate, success criteria, effective, improve, specific, feedback, strength, target, audience, purpose

#### EN-Y4-C049 — Editing for grammar, vocabulary and consistency
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Pupils propose changes to grammar and vocabulary to improve consistency, including the accurate use of pronouns in sentences to avoid repetition and ensure clarity

**Teaching guidance:** Teach editing as a craft skill — the ability to improve the quality of writing by changing vocabulary, sentence structures and organisation. Model editing techniques: replacing weak verbs with strong ones, adding or removing adjectives for precision, combining or splitting sentences for varied rhythm, and reorganising paragraphs for better flow. Teach children to use an editing pen (different colour from their writing pen) to make changes directly on their draft. Ensure children reread their edited version to check that changes improve the text.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may equate editing with adding more detail rather than making existing text better. They may resist editing because they see their first draft as finished. Some children make surface-level changes (swapping one adjective for another) rather than substantive revisions to content, structure or style.

**Key vocabulary:** edit, revise, improve, vocabulary, sentence structure, reorganise, draft, refine, strengthen, craft

#### EN-Y4-C050 — Proof-reading
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Pupils check and correct spelling and punctuation mistakes by re-reading their writing, monitoring meaning as they write

**Teaching guidance:** Consolidate proof-reading skills, teaching children to check systematically for spelling, punctuation and grammatical accuracy. Teach multi-pass proof-reading: read once for spelling (touching each word), once for punctuation (checking sentence boundaries), and once for grammar (reading aloud for sense). Provide year-group-specific proof-reading checklists that include Year 4 expectations: apostrophes for possession, commas after fronted adverbials, speech punctuation, consistent tense, and accurate spelling of statutory word list words.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may skim-read when proof-reading, reading what they intended rather than what they wrote. They may check for one type of error but miss others. Some children introduce new errors when correcting existing ones because they do not reread the corrected sentence. Others may declare their work 'perfect' without actually checking it carefully.

**Key vocabulary:** proof-read, check, correct, spelling, punctuation, grammar, error, accuracy, systematic, checklist

#### EN-Y4-C051 — Reading aloud own writing
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Pupils present their writing orally to a group or whole class with appropriate intonation, controlling tone and volume so that meaning is clear

**Teaching guidance:** Provide regular opportunities for children to read their own writing aloud, treating it as a performance that communicates their work to an audience. In Year 4, increase expectations for expression: children should vary pace, volume and tone to reflect the mood and meaning of their writing. Use peer response: listeners identify specific effective moments and ask questions. Connect reading aloud to the editing process — children often notice weaknesses in their writing when they hear it spoken. Encourage children to read aloud different types of writing: stories, poems, information texts and persuasive writing.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may rush through reading their own work because they are self-conscious. They may read aloud without expression because they are concentrating on decoding their own handwriting. Some children ad-lib improvements as they read rather than reading what is actually written, which defeats the purpose of using reading aloud as an editing tool.

**Key vocabulary:** read aloud, perform, expression, intonation, pace, volume, audience, communicate, share, respond

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**EN-Y4-D006-CL001:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Planning from model texts involves understanding how the model's structure serves its purpose — pupils analyse what the text does and why before designing their own version with an equivalent structure.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: The plan-rehearse-draft process is a compositional procedure that pupils learn as a reusable pattern for approaching any writing task, building procedural fluency through repetition across different genres.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**EN-Y4-D006-CL002:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Narrative elements (setting, character, plot) and non-fiction organisational devices are structural choices that serve specific communicative functions — pupils learn why stories need each element and why non-fiction texts use particular layouts.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Genre patterns for narrative (character introduction, build-up, climax, resolution) and non-fiction (introduction, sections, conclusion) are templates pupils apply to organise content across different writing purposes.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**EN-Y4-D006-CL003:**
- **Evidence and Argument** (primary): What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Evaluating writing requires using the text itself as evidence — pupils assess whether the words on the page achieve the intended effect, then edit based on that judgement with criteria as the argumentative standard.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'
- **Perspective and Interpretation**: Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?
  Why: Reading aloud own writing and evaluating it requires adopting the perspective of the intended audience, asking whether the effect intended by the writer is the effect experienced by the reader.
  AI instruction: Use the PERSPECTIVE AND INTERPRETATION lens: prompt pupils to identify the author's or actor's viewpoint, consider what information or experience shapes that perspective, look for omissions or contradictions, and compare multiple accounts. Useful questions: 'Who wrote/said this, and why?', 'What might they have left out?', 'How would someone else see this differently?', 'What would change your view?'

## Domain: EN-Y4-D007 — Writing - Vocabulary, Grammar and Punctuation
**Subject:** English | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 8-9 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Vocabulary, grammar and punctuation at Year 4 builds on the grammatical understanding of Year 3 to develop pupils' ability to write sentences of greater complexity and variety. Pupils learn to use fronted adverbials, expanded noun phrases, pronouns to avoid ambiguity, and the possessive apostrophe — including for plural nouns. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to use inverted commas and other punctuation to indicate direct speech accurately, and to understand the grammatical difference between standard and non-standard English forms. Pupils extend their grammatical vocabulary to include noun phrase, relative pronoun, subordinate clause, direct and indirect speech, and possessive apostrophe, using these terms to discuss the effects of grammatical choices in reading and their own writing.

### Concepts (12)

#### EN-Y4-C052 — Multi-clause sentences with conjunctions
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Pupils extend the range of sentences with more than one clause by using a wider range of conjunctions, including when, if, because, although, creating subordinate clauses for varied effect

**Teaching guidance:** Consolidate and extend multi-clause sentence writing. In Year 4, children should use a wider range of subordinating conjunctions (although, while, until, since, unless, wherever) alongside co-ordinating conjunctions (and, but, or, so, yet). Teach children to vary sentence length and structure deliberately: short sentences for impact, longer multi-clause sentences for explanation and description. Model parsing complex sentences to identify clauses. Use sentence-combining and sentence-expanding activities to develop flexibility.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may write multi-clause sentences that are grammatically tangled, losing track of the main clause among multiple subordinate clauses. They may use 'when' and 'because' as their default subordinating conjunctions without varying their repertoire. Some children write either all simple sentences or all complex sentences, lacking the ability to vary for effect.

**Key vocabulary:** clause, multi-clause, conjunction, although, while, until, since, subordinate, co-ordinate, vary, sentence

#### EN-Y4-C053 — Present perfect tense
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Pupils understand and use the present perfect form of verbs (have/has + past participle) in contrast to the simple past tense, understanding the difference in meaning and when each is appropriate

**Teaching guidance:** Consolidate the present perfect tense by providing regular practice in Year 4 writing. Teach children to choose between the simple past and present perfect with awareness of the difference in meaning: 'I ate lunch' (completed) vs 'I have eaten lunch' (relevant to now). Practise with irregular past participles that cause common errors: gone (not went), done (not did), seen (not saw), written (not wrote), taken (not took). Use dictation and editing activities to reinforce correct usage.

**Common misconceptions:** Children commonly use the simple past form instead of the past participle with 'has/have' (e.g., 'I have went' instead of 'I have gone', 'She has wrote' instead of 'She has written'). They may not understand when to use the present perfect versus the simple past. Some children avoid the present perfect entirely because they find it confusing.

**Key vocabulary:** present perfect, has, have, past participle, tense, simple past, irregular, gone, done, seen, written

#### EN-Y4-C054 — Pronoun choice for cohesion
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Pupils choose nouns or pronouns appropriately for clarity and cohesion within and across sentences, avoiding repetition while ensuring pronoun references are clear

**Teaching guidance:** Develop pronoun use for cohesion in Year 4, focusing on clear and unambiguous pronoun reference. Teach children to check that every pronoun has a clear antecedent — the reader should always know who or what the pronoun refers to. Use editing activities where children identify unclear pronoun reference and revise for clarity. Teach possessive pronouns (his, her, its, their, our, your, my) and demonstrative pronouns (this, that, these, those) alongside personal pronouns. Model choosing between nouns and pronouns for variety and clarity during shared writing.

**Common misconceptions:** Children frequently use pronouns ambiguously, particularly in narratives with characters of the same gender (e.g., 'Tom told Harry that he was late' — who was late?). They may overuse pronouns, creating passages where the referent is unclear. Conversely, some children avoid pronouns and repeat nouns excessively, producing stilted writing.

**Key vocabulary:** pronoun, cohesion, reference, antecedent, clear, ambiguous, he, she, they, it, his, her, their

#### EN-Y4-C055 — Conjunctions, adverbs and prepositions for time and cause
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Pupils use conjunctions (when, before, after, while, so, because), adverbs (then, next, soon, therefore) and prepositions (before, after, during, in, because of) to express time, place and cause in writing

**Teaching guidance:** Extend children's use of conjunctions, adverbs and prepositions to express time, cause and purpose. Year 4 additions include: purpose conjunctions (so that, in order to), concessive conjunctions (although, even though), and a wider range of adverbials (meanwhile, consequently, as a result, in contrast). Teach children to use these connectives to build logical relationships between ideas in both narrative and non-fiction writing. Display a connectives menu organised by function (time, cause, contrast, addition, purpose) for reference during writing.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may overuse one connective function (usually time: 'then... then... then...') without using causal, contrastive or purposive connectives. They may use connectives incorrectly, placing 'however' where 'because' is needed. Some children sprinkle connectives into their writing without understanding the logical relationship they signal.

**Key vocabulary:** conjunction, adverb, preposition, time, cause, purpose, although, meanwhile, consequently, so that

#### EN-Y4-C056 — Fronted adverbials
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Pupils understand and use fronted adverbials placed at the start of sentences for effect (e.g. Later that day, I heard the bad news.) and use commas after them

**Teaching guidance:** Consolidate the use of fronted adverbials in Year 4, extending the range of adverbial types. Teach time adverbials (Later that evening, After several attempts), place adverbials (Beyond the hedge, At the top of the hill), manner adverbials (Cautiously, With great care), and frequency adverbials (Often, Every morning). Ensure children always use a comma after a fronted adverbial. Model using fronted adverbials to improve the opening of sentences and to create variety in sentence structure. Avoid overuse — not every sentence should begin with a fronted adverbial.

**Common misconceptions:** Children commonly forget the comma after a fronted adverbial. They may overuse fronted adverbials, starting every sentence with one, creating a repetitive pattern. Some children confuse fronted adverbials with conjunctions and produce sentence fragments. Others use only single-word adverbials rather than adverbial phrases.

**Key vocabulary:** fronted adverbial, comma, time, place, manner, sentence opener, variety, adverbial phrase, position

#### EN-Y4-C057 — Direct speech punctuation
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Pupils use and punctuate direct speech fully, using inverted commas and other punctuation to indicate direct speech, including a comma after the reporting clause and end punctuation within inverted commas (e.g. The conductor shouted, "Sit down!")

**Teaching guidance:** Consolidate direct speech punctuation by practising more complex dialogue structures. Teach: speech before the reporting clause ('Hello,' said Tom.), speech after the reporting clause (Tom said, 'Hello.'), speech interrupted by the reporting clause ('Hello,' said Tom, 'how are you?'), and new speaker on a new line. Practise varying reporting verbs beyond 'said': whispered, exclaimed, asked, replied, muttered, announced. Use drama to generate natural-sounding dialogue that children then punctuate correctly in writing.

**Common misconceptions:** Children frequently misplace speech marks, particularly forgetting to close them or placing them around the reporting clause as well as the speech. They may not place the comma before the closing speech mark. The interrupted speech pattern ('Hello,' said Tom, 'how are you?') is particularly challenging. Some children put speech marks around reported speech.

**Key vocabulary:** speech marks, inverted commas, dialogue, reporting clause, said, asked, replied, new line, comma, punctuation

#### EN-Y4-C058 — Expanded noun phrases
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Pupils expand noun phrases by adding modifying adjectives, nouns and preposition phrases (e.g. the teacher expanded to: the strict maths teacher with curly hair) to build more precise and varied descriptions

**Teaching guidance:** Develop the use of expanded noun phrases with modifiers before and after the noun. In Year 4, extend beyond adjective + noun to include prepositional phrases after the noun: 'the old man with a walking stick', 'the abandoned house on the hill', 'a small kitten with bright green eyes'. Teach children to use expanded noun phrases for precise, vivid description rather than vague generality. Model choosing noun phrases that create specific images in the reader's mind. Connect to reading — identify and discuss effective noun phrases in class texts.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may add modifiers that are redundant or contradictory ('a big enormous giant'). They may not realise that noun phrases can include information after the noun as well as before it. Some children produce noun phrases that are overloaded with modifiers, making sentences unwieldy and difficult to read.

**Key vocabulary:** noun phrase, expanded, modifier, adjective, prepositional phrase, describe, detail, precise, vivid, image

#### EN-Y4-C059 — Plural vs possessive -s distinction
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Pupils understand and apply the grammatical difference between the plural -s (indicating more than one) and the possessive -s (indicating ownership), including with irregular plurals

**Teaching guidance:** Teach the distinction between plural -s and possessive -s (and possessive s') explicitly in Year 4, as this is a persistent source of error. Use the test: if you can replace '-s' with 'belongs to', it is possessive and needs an apostrophe; if it simply means 'more than one', it is plural and does not. Provide sorting and editing activities: children categorise words ending in -s as plural or possessive and add apostrophes where needed. Practise in sentence contexts to build automaticity.

**Common misconceptions:** This is one of the most common errors in children's writing across all year groups. Children may add apostrophes to all words ending in -s ('the apple's are red') or omit them from all possessives ('the girls coat'). They may know the rule but fail to apply it consistently in independent writing because it requires pausing to consider whether each -s is plural or possessive.

**Key vocabulary:** plural, possessive, apostrophe, -s, 's, belongs to, more than one, singular, grammar, distinguish

#### EN-Y4-C060 — Standard English verb inflections
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Pupils use Standard English forms for verb inflections instead of local spoken forms (e.g. we were instead of we was, or I did instead of I done), understanding the difference between Standard and non-Standard English

**Teaching guidance:** Teach Standard English verb inflections that differ from non-standard dialect forms. Focus on the key distinctions: 'we were' (not 'we was'), 'I did' (not 'I done'), 'she saw' (not 'she seen'), 'they went' (not 'they gone'), 'he ran' (not 'he run'), 'we have' (not 'we has'). Use editing activities where children identify and correct non-standard verb forms in written text. Approach sensitively: Standard English is expected in writing and formal speech, but dialect is a valid and valued form of communication in other contexts.

**Common misconceptions:** Children who speak a non-standard dialect may not hear a difference between 'I done it' and 'I did it', making it difficult to correct in writing. They may apply corrections inconsistently. Some children feel that correcting their verb forms is criticising their home language. Others may overcorrect, producing hypercorrect forms ('I were going').

**Key vocabulary:** Standard English, verb, inflection, we were, I did, she saw, they went, correct, formal, written

#### EN-Y4-C061 — Paragraphs to organise ideas around a theme
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Pupils use paragraphs to organise ideas around a theme in their writing, with appropriate choice of pronoun or noun within and across sentences to aid cohesion and avoid repetition

**Teaching guidance:** Develop paragraphing skills by teaching children to organise paragraphs around a clear theme or idea, with explicit topic sentences. In narrative, teach children to use paragraphs to control pace: short paragraphs for fast-paced action or tension, longer paragraphs for description and reflection. In non-fiction, teach that each paragraph should have a clear main idea supported by details, examples or evidence. Model linking paragraphs with cohesive devices that show the relationship between ideas.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may write paragraphs without topic sentences, making it difficult for the reader to identify the main idea. They may not use linking devices between paragraphs, creating disjointed text. Some children understand paragraphing in one text type (usually non-fiction) but not in another (usually narrative).

**Key vocabulary:** paragraph, theme, topic sentence, organise, main idea, detail, evidence, link, cohesion, pace, structure

#### EN-Y4-C062 — Year 4 grammatical terminology
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Pupils learn and use Year 4 grammatical terminology accurately when discussing writing and reading: determiner, pronoun, possessive pronoun, adverbial (building on cumulative terminology from previous years)

**Teaching guidance:** Teach the Year 4 grammatical terminology from Appendix 2: determiner, pronoun, possessive pronoun, adverbial. Ensure children can both define these terms and identify examples in context. Teach 'determiner' as the broader category that includes articles (a, an, the), demonstratives (this, that, these, those), possessives (my, your, his, her, its, our, their) and quantifiers (some, many, every). Teach 'adverbial' as a word, phrase or clause that functions as an adverb, telling when, where, how or why.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may struggle to understand 'determiner' as a category because it includes many different word types. They may confuse possessive pronouns (mine, yours, his, hers) with possessive determiners (my, your, his, her). Some children know the terminology but cannot explain the function of these elements in a sentence.

**Key vocabulary:** determiner, pronoun, possessive pronoun, adverbial, article, demonstrative, function, identify, terminology

#### EN-Y4-C063 — Figurative language and academic vocabulary
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Pupils demonstrate understanding of figurative language, distinguish shades of meaning among related words, and use age-appropriate academic vocabulary to express and discuss ideas with precision

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce figurative language through reading: identify and discuss similes, metaphors, personification and onomatopoeia in class texts. Teach children to use figurative language purposefully in their own writing — to create vivid images, to compare unfamiliar things to familiar ones, and to engage the reader emotionally. Develop academic vocabulary through cross-curricular learning, teaching subject-specific terminology in science, history, geography and RE. Encourage children to use precise, ambitious vocabulary rather than defaulting to simple, familiar words.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may use similes and metaphors that are clichéd ('as fast as lightning', 'a blanket of snow') rather than creating original comparisons. They may use figurative language excessively, producing overwritten prose. Some children confuse simile and metaphor. Others may use ambitious vocabulary incorrectly because they have encountered it in reading but not fully understood its meaning.

**Key vocabulary:** figurative language, simile, metaphor, personification, onomatopoeia, academic vocabulary, precise, vivid

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**EN-Y4-D007-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Fronted adverbials, conjunctions for time and cause, and direct speech punctuation are all rule-governed patterns — each has a consistent syntactic form and punctuation convention that pupils learn to apply across all instances.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Structure and Function**: How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Understanding why fronted adverbials are followed by a comma, and why direct speech uses inverted commas, connects punctuation conventions to their structural function: marking clause boundaries and speech boundaries respectively.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'

**EN-Y4-D007-CL002:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Present perfect tense, pronoun-antecedent agreement and Standard English verb inflections are grammatical patterns that must be applied consistently — errors arise when pupils overgeneralise or fail to apply the correct rule.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Structure and Function**: How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Pronoun choice for cohesion is a structure-function relationship: selecting the right pronoun is about how referential structure functions to maintain meaning continuity without repetition.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'

**EN-Y4-D007-CL003:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Expanded noun phrase patterns (determiner + modifier + noun + postmodifier) are syntactic templates, and figurative language patterns (simile, metaphor, personification) are rhetorical conventions pupils learn to recognise and reproduce.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Structure and Function**: How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Understanding how expanded noun phrases add descriptive precision and how figurative language creates specific effects connects structural choices (the expanded phrase, the simile) to their communicative functions.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'

**EN-Y4-D007-CL004:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Paragraphing around a theme and using layout features (headings, bullet points) are organisational structures that serve the function of orienting the reader — the metalinguistic dimension (grammatical terminology) helps pupils talk about these structural choices.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'

## Domain: MA-Y4-D001 — Number - Number and Place Value
**Subject:** Mathematics | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 8-9 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
In Year 4, pupils extend place value understanding from three-digit numbers to four-digit numbers (thousands, hundreds, tens, ones), significantly expanding the range of numbers they can work with. The non-statutory guidance specifies that pupils should practise reading Roman numerals to 100 (I to C) and begin to understand the year written in Roman numerals. Pupils work with negative numbers in contexts such as temperature and debt, and with rounding — to the nearest 10, 100 and 1000 — which develops estimation skills and understanding of approximation. This domain forms the essential prerequisite for place value work with numbers up to a million in Year 5, and the rounding skills introduced here are used throughout the upper key stage.

### Concepts (5)

#### MA-Y4-C001 — Place value in four-digit numbers
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 2

Four-digit numbers have digits in the thousands, hundreds, tens and ones positions (e.g. 3,472 = 3000 + 400 + 70 + 2). Understanding this extends the place value system one column to the left. Mastery means pupils can identify the value of any digit in a four-digit number, partition it in standard and flexible ways, and use this understanding as the basis for all four-digit calculations.

**Teaching guidance:** Extend the Dienes blocks to include thousands cubes (a 10 × 10 × 10 block). Use place value mats with Th, H, T, O columns. Arrow cards now include 1000, 2000, 3000... cards. Place value charts and number lines up to 10,000 provide pictorial support. Key: the thousands digit value is always a multiple of 1000, not simply the digit read as a single number. Practise partitioning in multiple ways (3472 = 3000 + 472 = 2000 + 1472 etc.).

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils sometimes say 3,472 has a 3 'worth 3' rather than 3000. In four-digit numbers, the zero placeholder causes confusion in numbers like 3,072 (no hundreds) — pupils may write this as 372 or 3720. Writing numbers in words becomes more complex (three thousand, four hundred and seventy-two — note 'and' placement).

**Key vocabulary:** thousands, hundreds, tens, ones, four-digit number, place value, partition, digit, value, represent

#### MA-Y4-C002 — Counting in multiples of 6, 7, 9, 25 and 1000
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Year 4 extends skip-counting to the six, seven, nine, twenty-five and one thousand times tables. Counting in 6s, 7s and 9s consolidates the corresponding multiplication tables; counting in 25s connects to money and measurement; counting in 1000s extends place value. Mastery means pupils can count fluently in all these multiples from different starting points and in both directions.

**Teaching guidance:** For 6s and 9s, use the connection to the 3 times table (6 = 2 × 3; 9 = 3 × 3). The '9 times table finger trick' helps some pupils. For 25s, connect to money: 25p, 50p, 75p, £1.00 — four 25ps make £1. For 1000s, extend the place value understanding to counting in thousands on a number line up to 10,000. Practise all multiples with a mix of 'continue the sequence' and 'what comes after/before?' questions.

**Common misconceptions:** The 7 times table is the hardest for most pupils and has no obvious pattern to aid memorisation. Counting in 25s causes errors at 100 (some pupils say 100, 125, 150... but then say 275, 300, 325... — correct — having been unsure at 200 and 225). Counting backwards in 9s is particularly challenging.

**Key vocabulary:** multiples of six, seven, nine, twenty-five, thousand, skip count, sequence, count on, count back

#### MA-Y4-C003 — Negative numbers in context
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Negative numbers extend the number line below zero. In Year 4, pupils encounter them in contexts such as temperature below freezing, below sea level, and financial debt. Pupils must be able to count through zero in both directions and compare negative numbers. Mastery means pupils can read and record negative numbers in context, compare negative numbers (e.g. –3 > –7), count through zero, and calculate intervals crossing zero.

**Teaching guidance:** Use a vertical number line (like a thermometer) as the primary visual tool — the physical analogy of temperature falling below zero is highly effective. Number lines on the floor (walk below zero) and horizontal number lines that extend left of zero both help. Practise reading temperatures on a thermometer scale. Compare pairs of temperatures: 'Which is colder, –3°C or –7°C?' Establish: numbers get smaller the further left (or down) you go, even below zero.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils commonly think –7 is greater than –3 because 7 > 3 — they apply the absolute value comparison rather than the signed comparison. The language 'minus seven' is confused with 'take away seven', so some pupils treat –7 as a subtraction instruction rather than a number. The word 'negative' itself is important to use alongside 'minus' to make the distinction clear.

**Key vocabulary:** negative, below zero, minus, temperature, degrees Celsius, thermometer, number line, count through zero, compare, less than

#### MA-Y4-C004 — Rounding to nearest 10, 100 and 1000
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Rounding is the process of approximating a number to the nearest multiple of 10, 100 or 1000. The rule is: if the digit in the column to the right of the target column is 5 or more, round up; if it is 4 or less, round down. Mastery means pupils can round any number to the specified degree of accuracy, explain the rule with reference to the number line, and use rounding as a checking and estimation tool.

**Teaching guidance:** Use a number line to show rounding as finding the nearer of the two bounding multiples. For rounding 347 to the nearest 100: it is between 300 and 400, closer to 300, so it rounds to 300. The 'five is on the right side of the hill' mnemonic helps establish the convention for 5. Practise rounding to different degrees of accuracy on the same number. Connect to estimation: before computing 347 + 256, round both to nearest 100 to estimate 300 + 300 = 600.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils frequently look at the wrong digit when rounding (rounding to nearest 100, they look at the ones digit rather than the tens digit). The midpoint convention (when the digit is exactly 5, round up) is not understood conceptually, only as a rule. Rounding to the nearest 1000 can produce 0 for numbers less than 500, which surprises pupils.

**Key vocabulary:** round, nearest, approximate, ten, hundred, thousand, digit, round up, round down, boundary, midpoint

#### MA-Y4-C005 — Roman numerals to 100 (I to C)
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Roman numerals use letters to represent values: I=1, V=5, X=10, L=50, C=100. The system uses additive (VI = 5+1 = 6) and subtractive (IV = 5-1 = 4) principles. In Year 4, pupils read Roman numerals to 100 and understand historically how this differs from our place value system. Mastery means pupils can convert any number from 1-100 to and from Roman numerals and explain why the Roman system does not have place value.

**Teaching guidance:** Display the seven basic Roman numeral symbols prominently (I, V, X, L, C, D, M — though D and M are not required until later). Teach the subtractive rule: when a smaller numeral precedes a larger one, it is subtracted (IV = 4, IX = 9, XL = 40, XC = 90). Practise conversions in both directions. Connect to history: discuss why the Roman system had no zero and how that limited mathematical development. Contrast with our positional/place value system.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils frequently forget the subtractive rule and read IV as 6 (I + V) rather than 4 (V – I). They may apply the subtractive rule incorrectly: IIX is not a valid Roman numeral (the convention is that only one smaller numeral precedes a larger one). Some pupils confuse Roman numeral C (100) with the letter and assign it other values.

**Key vocabulary:** Roman numerals, I, V, X, L, C, additive, subtractive, symbol, convert, place value, zero

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**MA-Y4-D001-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Place value is the positional pattern in our base-10 number system — pupils recognise how each digit's value follows a regular, predictable rule they can extend indefinitely.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Scale, Proportion and Quantity**: How big, how many, or how much — and how does that change how we think about it?
  Why: Understanding that each place is ten times the previous introduces the multiplicative structure of our number system — a fundamentally proportional idea.

## Domain: MA-Y4-D002 — Number - Addition and Subtraction
**Subject:** Mathematics | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 8-9 | **Structure:** sequential

### Curriculum Context
In Year 4, pupils consolidate and extend the formal columnar methods introduced in Year 3 to four-digit numbers. The non-statutory guidance emphasises that pupils should practise adding and subtracting increasingly large numbers to aid fluency and develop their mental arithmetic, using jottings to support calculation where necessary. Pupils are expected to use efficient methods and to select the most appropriate approach for each calculation — mental, jottings or formal written. The extension to four-digit numbers means exchanges can occur in more columns simultaneously, making rigorous understanding of place value even more important. This consolidation prepares pupils for the multi-step addition and subtraction in contexts across all domains of Year 4 and the transition to larger numbers in Year 5.

### Concepts (1)

#### MA-Y4-C006 — Formal columnar addition and subtraction of four-digit numbers
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Columnar addition and subtraction are extended to four-digit numbers in Year 4, requiring exchanges (carries) to occur in up to three columns simultaneously. Pupils must apply the method reliably for any combination of four-digit numbers. Mastery means pupils can set out and solve any four-digit addition or subtraction using formal written methods, with correct alignment, carrying and borrowing, and can check answers using the inverse operation.

**Teaching guidance:** Revisit and consolidate three-digit columnar methods before extending to four digits. The structure of the method is identical — simply add a thousands column on the left. Emphasise alignment: use squared paper, printed column frames or turn plain paper landscape with hand-drawn columns. For subtraction with four digits, cascading exchanges (e.g. 3000 – 1 requires exchanging through three columns: 3000 = 2 thousands, 9 hundreds, 9 tens, 10 ones) need explicit practice. Check using the inverse.

**Common misconceptions:** The most common error remains forgetting the carry in addition. For subtraction, the cascading exchange through zeros (4000 – 1 = ?) is the most challenging case and requires step-by-step practice. Some pupils align the digits from the left rather than the right, corrupting the place value structure.

**Key vocabulary:** column addition, column subtraction, carry, exchange, borrow, align, thousands, hundreds, tens, ones, digit

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**MA-Y4-D002-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Place value is the positional pattern in our base-10 number system — pupils recognise how each digit's value follows a regular, predictable rule they can extend indefinitely.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Scale, Proportion and Quantity**: How big, how many, or how much — and how does that change how we think about it?
  Why: Understanding that each place is ten times the previous introduces the multiplicative structure of our number system — a fundamentally proportional idea.
  AI instruction: Use the SCALE, PROPORTION AND QUANTITY lens: prompt pupils to compare quantities using ratios and percentages, consider what changes when scale changes, and choose appropriate units of measurement. Useful questions: 'How many times bigger?', 'What fraction of the whole?', 'What changes when we zoom in/out?', 'Which units fit best here?'

## Domain: MA-Y4-D003 — Number - Multiplication and Division
**Subject:** Mathematics | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 8-9 | **Structure:** sequential

### Curriculum Context
Year 4 is the statutory point by which pupils must know all multiplication tables to 12 × 12, making it a landmark year for multiplicative fluency. The non-statutory guidance states that pupils should practise mental methods and should be able to derive quickly all multiplication and division facts from the tables they know, and should understand the distributive and commutative laws. Pupils are introduced to short multiplication (long multiplication is in Year 5) and short division, building on the mental and partial methods from Year 3. This thorough foundation in all multiplication facts is essential for fraction calculations, long division, ratio, and algebra throughout upper KS2 and into secondary school.

### Concepts (3)

#### MA-Y4-C007 — All multiplication tables to 12 × 12 **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 4 | Fan-out: 5

By end of Year 4, pupils must know all multiplication facts to 12 × 12 and the corresponding division facts to immediate recall. This is a statutory requirement and represents a major milestone in mathematical fluency. Mastery means automatic, accurate recall of any multiplication or division fact within the 12 × 12 grid without counting or deriving, enabling rapid computation and problem-solving.

**Teaching guidance:** By Year 4, pupils should know the 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 10 times tables from Year 3. New tables are 6, 7, 9, 11 and 12. Use commutativity to reduce the learning load: knowing 6 × 7 = 42 gives 7 × 6 = 42 for free. Highlight patterns: 9 times table (digit sum always 9; ones digits decrease by 1 as tens digits increase by 1). 11 times table (to 9 × 11 = 99, the digits repeat: 11, 22, 33...). 12 times table (connect to 10× and 2×: 12 × n = 10 × n + 2 × n). Use a range of practice methods: games, cards, rapid-fire oral tests, written grids.

**Common misconceptions:** The 6 × 7 = 42 and 7 × 8 = 56 facts are the most commonly misremembered in the 12 × 12 grid. Pupils who have memorised facts by rote without connections confuse similar-sounding facts (6 × 8 = 48 vs 6 × 7 = 42). Division facts are frequently less secure than multiplication facts, even when the multiplication is known — pupils must practise division recall explicitly.

**Key vocabulary:** multiplication table, times table, multiplication fact, division fact, recall, product, quotient, factor, multiple, fluency, 12 × 12

#### MA-Y4-C008 — Short multiplication (2- and 3-digit × 1-digit)
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Short multiplication is the compact formal written method for multiplying a multi-digit number by a single-digit number, working right to left and carrying any value of 10 or more into the next column. In Year 4, this is used for two-digit and three-digit numbers multiplied by one-digit numbers. Mastery means pupils can reliably set out and complete any such calculation using the formal compact method.

**Teaching guidance:** Build from the grid method (used in Year 3) to the compact method. Show how the grid method's partial products combine into carries in the compact layout. The CPA sequence: Dienes blocks for physical regrouping → grid as pictorial → compact method. Emphasise: multiply the ones digit first, carry to the tens; multiply the tens digit, add the carry, carry to the hundreds; and so on. Carry digits written small above the relevant column. Example: 247 × 3 — ones: 7×3=21 (write 1, carry 2); tens: 4×3=12+2=14 (write 4, carry 1); hundreds: 2×3=6+1=7; answer 741.

**Common misconceptions:** The most common error is forgetting to add the carried digit. Some pupils multiply from left to right, which works but produces the wrong carry sequence. Others carry the complete partial product rather than just the tens digit (e.g. 7 × 3 = 21, carrying the '21' rather than writing 1 and carrying 2).

**Key vocabulary:** short multiplication, formal method, carry, digit, ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, compact, multiply

#### MA-Y4-C009 — Factor pairs and commutativity in mental calculation
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 2

A factor pair of a number is a pair of integers that multiply to give that number (e.g. factor pairs of 24 include 1 × 24, 2 × 12, 3 × 8, 4 × 6). Commutativity means a × b = b × a. Together, these allow pupils to reorder and regroup calculations for efficiency: 4 × 17 × 5 = 4 × 5 × 17 = 20 × 17 = 340 (reordering to create a convenient factor pair). Mastery means pupils can identify factor pairs of numbers up to 100, apply commutativity to reorder calculations, and explain why these strategies work.

**Teaching guidance:** Use arrays to demonstrate commutativity: a 4 × 6 array is identical to a 6 × 4 array, just rotated. For factor pairs, systematic listing from 1 upwards helps ensure completeness: factors of 24: 1 and 24, 2 and 12, 3 and 8, 4 and 6 — stop when the smaller factor reaches the square root. Connect factor pairs to the multiplication table grid: every entry in the grid corresponds to a factor pair of that number.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often confuse factors and multiples (a factor of 24 divides 24 exactly; a multiple of 24 is 24 times a whole number). When listing factor pairs, pupils frequently miss pairs or stop before reaching all pairs. Some pupils do not spontaneously apply commutativity in mental calculation, missing opportunities to create simpler calculations.

**Key vocabulary:** factor, factor pair, product, commutative, commutative law, associative, reorder, mental calculation, efficient

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**MA-Y4-D003-CL001:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Geometry connects structural properties (angles, side lengths, symmetry) to what is possible or provable — the question is always how the structure determines the behaviour.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Scale, Proportion and Quantity**: How big, how many, or how much — and how does that change how we think about it?
  Why: Similarity, enlargement and trigonometry are fundamentally about proportional relationships between measurements in figures across different scales.
  AI instruction: Use the SCALE, PROPORTION AND QUANTITY lens: prompt pupils to compare quantities using ratios and percentages, consider what changes when scale changes, and choose appropriate units of measurement. Useful questions: 'How many times bigger?', 'What fraction of the whole?', 'What changes when we zoom in/out?', 'Which units fit best here?'

**MA-Y4-D003-CL002:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: The four operations follow consistent patterns and rules (commutativity, distributivity, inverse relationships) that pupils recognise across different number types.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Each operation enacts a causal transformation: adding causes an increase, multiplying by a factor causes proportional growth — understanding this causality deepens fluency.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

## Domain: MA-Y4-D004 — Number - Fractions (including Decimals)
**Subject:** Mathematics | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 8-9 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
In Year 4, the fractions domain expands significantly to include decimals for the first time. Pupils learn that the decimal system extends the place value system to the right of the decimal point — tenths (one tenth = 0.1) and hundredths (one hundredth = 0.01). The non-statutory guidance explains that pupils connect tenths to place value and decimal measures, and understand that decimal notation is an alternative to fraction notation for parts of a whole. Pupils learn to find equivalent fractions systematically by multiplying numerator and denominator by the same number, and to add and subtract fractions and mixed numbers with the same denominator. This domain bridges the fraction understanding of Year 3 with the percentages and fraction operations of Year 5.

### Concepts (3)

#### MA-Y4-C010 — Hundredths and decimal place value **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 3

A hundredth is one of one hundred equal parts of a whole (1/100 = 0.01). The second decimal place (hundredths) extends the decimal place value system established with tenths in Year 3. Mastery means pupils understand that 0.01 = 1/100, can count up and down in hundredths, understand that 10 hundredths = 1 tenth, and can identify the value of any digit in a decimal number with two decimal places.

**Teaching guidance:** Use a 10 × 10 grid (like a hundred square but representing one whole): each small square is 1/100 = 0.01, each row/column of 10 squares is 1/10 = 0.1. Hundredths number lines (0 to 1 marked in 0.01 steps) provide pictorial support. Connect to metric measures: 1 cm = 0.01 m, since 100 cm = 1 m. Money provides a natural context: £1.47 means 1 pound, 4 tenths of a pound and 7 hundredths of a pound. Practise reading and writing decimal numbers with up to two decimal places.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often think 0.17 is 'zero point seventeen' and therefore larger than 0.9 (which they read as 'zero point nine') because 17 > 9. This is the most critical misconception in decimal place value. Pupils may also think 0.1 = 0.10 but not understand why (the zero adds no value). The connection between fraction and decimal notation (1/100 = 0.01) is often procedural rather than conceptual.

**Key vocabulary:** hundredth, one hundredth, 0.01, 1/100, decimal place, tenths, hundredths, decimal point, column, value

#### MA-Y4-C011 — Equivalent fractions using multiples and factors
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 2

Equivalent fractions can be generated by multiplying or dividing both numerator and denominator by the same non-zero number. For example, 1/2 = 2/4 = 3/6 = 4/8 (multiplying by 2, 3, 4 respectively). Families of equivalent fractions share a common value. Mastery means pupils can generate equivalent fractions systematically, recognise whether two fractions are equivalent, and use equivalence to compare and order fractions with different denominators.

**Teaching guidance:** Use fraction walls and fraction circles to show equivalence visually. The rule: multiplying numerator and denominator by the same number (×n/n = 1) preserves the value. Generate families: 1/3, 2/6, 3/9, 4/12... Practice: find three fractions equivalent to 2/5 (4/10, 6/15, 8/20). Connect to simplifying fractions (divide both by the same number). Use equivalent fractions to add fractions with different but related denominators: 1/3 + 1/6 = 2/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils understand that multiplying both parts works but struggle to explain why it preserves value. They may think only one specific fraction in a family is 'correct'. When using equivalence to compare fractions, pupils may use trial and error rather than a systematic approach.

**Key vocabulary:** equivalent, fraction, numerator, denominator, multiply, divide, simplify, fraction wall, family, common value

#### MA-Y4-C012 — Decimal equivalents to common fractions
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Certain common fractions have well-known decimal equivalents: 1/2 = 0.5, 1/4 = 0.25, 3/4 = 0.75, 1/10 = 0.1, 1/100 = 0.01. These equivalences must be known to automaticity. Mastery means pupils can convert between fraction and decimal notation for these key fractions instantly and use these equivalences in measurement and money contexts.

**Teaching guidance:** Use money as the most natural context: £0.50 = £1/2; £0.25 = £1/4 (25p is a quarter of a pound). Use the hundredths grid: shade 50 squares for 1/2 = 0.50; shade 25 squares for 1/4 = 0.25. Connect to division: 1 ÷ 2 = 0.5; 1 ÷ 4 = 0.25. Extend to any tenths: 3/10 = 0.3, 7/10 = 0.7. Display a reference table until these are memorised.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often write 1/4 = 0.4 (reading the denominator as the decimal digit rather than dividing). They may know 1/2 = 0.5 but not connect 3/4 = 0.75 (which requires recognising it as 3 × 0.25). The equivalence 1/10 = 0.1 is usually secure; 1/100 = 0.01 is less so.

**Key vocabulary:** decimal equivalent, fraction, one half, one quarter, three quarters, decimal point, convert, tenths, hundredths

  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

## Domain: MA-Y4-D005 — Measurement
**Subject:** Mathematics | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 8-9 | **Structure:** mixed

### Curriculum Context
In Year 4, measurement extends to calculating area (introduced formally for the first time) alongside perimeter, converting between standard metric units (e.g. km to m, l to ml, kg to g), and reading scales more accurately. The non-statutory guidance explains that pupils should connect decimals to metric measures (e.g. 1.25 km = 1 km and 250 m). Time work includes converting between analogue and digital formats and between units of time (minutes to hours, hours to days). The introduction of area — counting squares and using length × width for rectangles — is a major new concept that connects geometry and number, and pupils must distinguish clearly between perimeter (distance around) and area (space inside). Practical measurement contexts reinforce number concepts throughout the year.

### Concepts (2)

#### MA-Y4-C013 — Area of rectilinear shapes
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Area is the amount of space enclosed within a 2-D shape, measured in square units (cm², m²). In Year 4, pupils find area of rectilinear shapes by counting squares on a grid. They should also understand that area of a rectangle = length × width. Mastery means pupils can find area by counting, apply the formula for rectangles, and clearly distinguish area (space inside) from perimeter (distance around).

**Teaching guidance:** Begin by counting squares on squared paper — trace a shape onto squared paper and count every full square. Progress to L-shaped and irregular rectilinear shapes. Introduce the formula: a rectangle of length 5 cm and width 3 cm can be seen as 5 columns of 3 squares = 5 × 3 = 15 cm². Connect to multiplication: length × width uses the multiplication skills from the multiplication domain. Always compare with perimeter of the same shape to keep the distinction clear.

**Common misconceptions:** Confusion between area and perimeter is the single most persistent misconception in measurement. Pupils may count perimeter squares instead of area squares, or use addition (l + w) for area and multiplication (l × w) for perimeter — exactly backwards. When shapes are not rectangles (L-shapes), pupils often struggle to decompose them into rectangles for calculating area.

**Key vocabulary:** area, square centimetre, cm², square metre, m², length, width, multiply, rectilinear, rectangle, count squares, formula

#### MA-Y4-C014 — Converting between metric units
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Metric unit conversion uses the prefix system: kilo- means × 1000 (km to m, kg to g), centi- means × 100 (m to cm), milli- means × 1000 (l to ml, m to mm). Pupils must convert in both directions (km to m and m to km). Mastery means pupils know the key conversion facts by heart and can perform conversions correctly in both directions, connecting to multiplication and division.

**Teaching guidance:** Use the memorable prefix facts: kilo- = 1000 (connect to the word 'kilogram' = 1000 grams, like a kilowatt = 1000 watts in science). Practice conversion tables: 1 km = 1000 m, 1 m = 100 cm, 1 m = 1000 mm, 1 kg = 1000 g, 1 l = 1000 ml. Converting down (larger unit to smaller) involves multiplication; converting up (smaller to larger) involves division. Connect to decimals: 1.5 km = 1500 m; 250 m = 0.25 km.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils frequently multiply when they should divide and vice versa (confusing which direction the conversion goes). They may think 1 m = 10 cm or 1 kg = 100 g (confusing the different prefix multipliers). The fact that both 'm' and 'mm' involve metres causes confusion: 1 m = 1000 mm (not 100 mm) because milli- = 1/1000.

**Key vocabulary:** convert, kilometre, metre, centimetre, millimetre, kilogram, gram, litre, millilitre, kilo-, centi-, milli-, multiply, divide

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**MA-Y4-D005-CL001:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Geometry connects structural properties (angles, side lengths, symmetry) to what is possible or provable — the question is always how the structure determines the behaviour.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Scale, Proportion and Quantity**: How big, how many, or how much — and how does that change how we think about it?
  Why: Similarity, enlargement and trigonometry are fundamentally about proportional relationships between measurements in figures across different scales.
  AI instruction: Use the SCALE, PROPORTION AND QUANTITY lens: prompt pupils to compare quantities using ratios and percentages, consider what changes when scale changes, and choose appropriate units of measurement. Useful questions: 'How many times bigger?', 'What fraction of the whole?', 'What changes when we zoom in/out?', 'Which units fit best here?'

**MA-Y4-D005-CL002:**
- **Scale, Proportion and Quantity** (primary): How big, how many, or how much — and how does that change how we think about it?

Useful questions: 'How many times bigger?', 'What fraction of the whole?', 'What changes when we zoom in/out?', 'Which units fit best here?'
- **Structure and Function**: How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

## Domain: MA-Y4-D006 — Geometry - Properties of Shapes
**Subject:** Mathematics | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 8-9 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
In Year 4, geometry develops from the Year 3 foundation of angles and line types to classifying shapes according to their properties and working with coordinates. Pupils compare and classify triangles (equilateral, isosceles, scalene, right-angled) and quadrilaterals (square, rectangle, rhombus, parallelogram, trapezium), identifying properties such as parallel and perpendicular sides and types of angles. Coordinates in the first quadrant (positive x and y values) are introduced as a means of describing position precisely, preparing for reflections and translation in Year 5. The non-statutory guidance emphasises that pupils should use right angles, acute angles and obtuse angles to classify shapes, and should use coordinate notation (x, y) correctly.

### Concepts (2)

#### MA-Y4-C016 — Classifying triangles and quadrilaterals
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Triangles are classified by side length (equilateral: all equal; isosceles: two equal; scalene: all different) and by angles (right-angled: contains a 90° angle; acute: all angles less than 90°; obtuse: one angle greater than 90°). Quadrilaterals include squares, rectangles, parallelograms, rhombuses and trapeziums. Mastery means pupils can classify any triangle or quadrilateral from a description or diagram, giving reasons based on measured properties.

**Teaching guidance:** Provide sets of triangles and quadrilaterals for sorting and classifying, including non-prototypical examples (an isosceles triangle pointing sideways; a tilted square). Use Venn diagrams for overlapping classifications (right-angled AND isosceles). For quadrilaterals, build a hierarchy: square is a special rectangle (all sides equal); rectangle is a special parallelogram (right angles); parallelogram is a special trapezium (both pairs of parallel sides). Measure angles and sides to verify classifications.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils frequently think squares and rectangles are entirely different (not recognising a square as a special rectangle). They may not accept an isosceles triangle as isosceles when it is presented pointing left or right rather than upward. Some pupils classify by appearance (prototype matching) rather than by measuring and checking properties.

**Key vocabulary:** triangle, equilateral, isosceles, scalene, right-angled, acute, obtuse, quadrilateral, square, rectangle, parallelogram, rhombus, trapezium, parallel, perpendicular, classify, properties

#### MA-Y4-C017 — Lines of symmetry
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

A line of symmetry (also called a mirror line) divides a shape into two halves that are mirror images of each other. A shape may have zero, one or more lines of symmetry. Pupils in Year 4 identify lines of symmetry in 2-D shapes presented in different orientations and complete symmetric figures given one line of symmetry. Mastery means pupils can identify all lines of symmetry in common shapes, test whether a given line is a line of symmetry, and complete a half-shape accurately.

**Teaching guidance:** Use mirrors (Mira mirrors are ideal) to check symmetry practically. Folding: fold a shape along a proposed line of symmetry and check whether the two halves match exactly. On squared/dotted paper, completing a symmetric figure requires reflecting each key point the same distance on the other side of the line. Regular polygons: equilateral triangle has 3, square has 4, regular pentagon has 5, regular hexagon has 6. A scalene triangle has 0. Irregular shapes may have 0 or 1.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often identify only vertical lines of symmetry, not recognising diagonal or horizontal lines. They may think all shapes have at least one line of symmetry. When completing symmetric figures, pupils reflect the shape rather than the key points, leading to inaccurate completions. Shapes presented in non-standard orientations may be unrecognised as symmetric.

**Key vocabulary:** symmetry, line of symmetry, mirror line, reflect, reflection, fold, match, equal, half, shape, orientation

## Domain: MA-Y4-D007 — Geometry - Position and Direction
**Subject:** Mathematics | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 8-9 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
In Year 4, position and direction is formalised through the introduction of coordinates in the first quadrant of a grid. Pupils learn to plot and read points using (x, y) notation, with x measuring horizontal distance from the origin and y measuring vertical distance. The curriculum specifies that pupils should describe movements between positions as translations (moving left/right and up/down). This is the first formal algebraic representation pupils encounter — an ordered pair of numbers describing a unique position. Coordinate geometry provides the geometric language needed for Year 5 reflections and translations, and ultimately for graphing linear functions in secondary school.

### Concepts (1)

#### MA-Y4-C015 — Coordinates in the first quadrant
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

A coordinate is an ordered pair of numbers (x, y) that uniquely describes a position on a 2-D grid. The first quadrant contains points with positive x (horizontal) and positive y (vertical) values. Pupils must plot and read coordinates accurately. Mastery means pupils can read any coordinate from a grid, plot any given coordinate, use coordinates to describe positions of shapes, and connect changes in coordinates to translations.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach the mnemonic 'along the corridor, then up the stairs' (x first, then y) to establish the conventional order. Use large grid paper and plot points physically. Start with integer coordinates, then extend to half-unit coordinates if pupils are secure. Plot the vertices of shapes and ask pupils to identify coordinates; give coordinates and ask pupils to draw shapes. Connect to the first quadrant specifically — all values positive. Introduce the origin (0, 0) as the reference point.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils frequently reverse x and y coordinates — plotting (3, 5) at the position (5, 3). This is very common and persistent. Some pupils count the grid lines rather than the spaces, giving coordinates one unit too large. Pupils may also confuse the x-axis (horizontal) with the y-axis (vertical).

**Key vocabulary:** coordinate, x-coordinate, y-coordinate, origin, grid, first quadrant, horizontal, vertical, plot, ordered pair, axis, axes

## Domain: MA-Y4-D008 — Statistics
**Subject:** Mathematics | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 8-9 | **Structure:** sequential

### Curriculum Context
In Year 4, statistics introduces continuous data and time graphs alongside the bar charts and tables of Year 3. The non-statutory guidance clarifies that pupils should understand the difference between discrete data (individual counts, shown as bar charts) and continuous data (measurements over time, shown as line graphs). Pupils solve comparison, sum and difference problems using information from graphs and tables. The introduction of line graphs to show how a quantity changes over time (e.g. temperature through the day) prepares pupils for the more complex data interpretation of Years 5 and 6. Pupils also practise choosing appropriate representations for their data.

### Concepts (1)

#### MA-Y4-C018 — Time graphs and continuous data
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

A time graph (line graph) shows how a quantity changes continuously over time, with time on the horizontal axis. The continuous line between plotted points implies values exist for all intermediate times. Pupils must read values from the graph, describe trends (rising, falling, constant) and calculate changes. Mastery means pupils can read and interpret a time graph accurately, describe the trend, and answer comparison and difference questions.

**Teaching guidance:** Use familiar real-world contexts: temperature through the day, plant growth over weeks, a car journey showing distance over time. Plot simple datasets (4-6 data points) and draw the line between them. Distinguish from bar charts (bar charts use bars for discrete categories; line graphs use a continuous line for values that change over time). Emphasise reading values between plotted points (interpolation) as a key feature of continuous graphs.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often try to draw bar charts for data that should be a line graph (not understanding the discrete/continuous distinction). They may read only the plotted points and not realise they can read values between them. Some pupils join points with a straight ruler between each pair correctly, but then interpret the joined-up shape as the 'answer' rather than as a visual representation of change.

**Key vocabulary:** time graph, line graph, continuous data, trend, increase, decrease, constant, horizontal axis, vertical axis, read, interpolate, temperature

Working scientifically at KS2 underpins all science learning and requires pupils to use a range of scientific methods and processes, progressing from the exploratory approaches of KS1 to systematic, fair-test investigations. Pupils develop the ability to plan different types of scientific enquiry — including observing over time, pattern seeking, classifying, comparative and fair testing, and researching using secondary sources — selecting the most appropriate method for the question being asked. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to recognise that scientific evidence is used to support or refute ideas, to take measurements using standard units, to record and present data in a variety of graphical forms, and to draw conclusions consistent with their evidence. By the end of KS2, pupils should be able to report and present findings from enquiries using appropriate scientific language and representations.

### Concepts (10)

#### SC-KS2-C001 — Relevant Questioning and Enquiry Selection
Type: process | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

The ability to ask relevant scientific questions and select the most appropriate type of scientific enquiry to answer them (observation over time, pattern seeking, classifying, fair testing, secondary research). Develops from KS1 simple questioning to active enquiry design.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce the five types of scientific enquiry explicitly: observation over time, pattern seeking, classifying and grouping, comparative and fair testing, and researching using secondary sources. Present pupils with a question and ask them to decide which type of enquiry would best answer it. Use a 'question sorter' display where pupils categorise questions by enquiry type. Model asking relevant questions by connecting to the content being studied — for example, during a rocks topic ask 'Which rock is the most permeable?' (fair test) versus 'How are fossils formed?' (secondary research).

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often believe that all scientific questions must be answered by carrying out an experiment. They need explicit teaching that observation over time, classification, pattern seeking and secondary research are equally valid enquiry types. Some pupils confuse 'relevant' questions with 'interesting' questions — relevant questions are those that can be investigated scientifically.

**Key vocabulary:** enquiry, investigate, fair test, comparative test, observation over time, pattern seeking, classify, secondary source, relevant, variable, method, question

#### SC-KS2-C002 — Fair and Comparative Testing
Type: process | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Setting up simple practical enquiries as fair tests, recognising and controlling variables. Understanding that a fair test changes only one variable at a time while keeping others constant, enabling valid comparisons.

**Teaching guidance:** Begin with comparative tests (e.g., 'Which surface does the car travel furthest on?') before introducing fair tests with controlled variables. Use a planning framework that explicitly asks: 'What will I change? What will I measure? What will I keep the same?' Provide practical contexts such as testing which paper towel is most absorbent or which material is best for insulating a cup of warm water. Encourage pupils to predict outcomes before testing and to explain why the test must be fair to get reliable results.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils frequently change more than one variable at a time without recognising this invalidates the comparison. Some pupils believe that a test is 'fair' simply because everyone in the group gets a turn, rather than understanding it as controlling variables. Pupils may also confuse prediction with guessing — a prediction should be based on existing knowledge or prior observations.

**Key vocabulary:** fair test, comparative test, variable, change, measure, keep the same, control, predict, result, reliable, method, equipment

#### SC-KS2-C003 — Systematic Measurement with Standard Units
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Making systematic and careful observations using standard units (e.g., degrees Celsius, metres, grams). Using a range of equipment including thermometers and data loggers. Increasing accuracy over Lower KS2.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach pupils to select appropriate equipment for the measurement being taken — rulers for length, thermometers for temperature, measuring cylinders for liquid volume, balances for mass. Practise reading scales with different intervals (ones, twos, fives, tens). Introduce data loggers for temperature and light investigations, demonstrating how they capture readings automatically over time. Link measurement to maths by reinforcing standard units (cm, m, g, kg, ml, l, °C) and by practising estimation before measuring.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils commonly misread scales by counting lines rather than intervals, leading to systematic errors. Some pupils believe that digital instruments are always more accurate than analogue ones. Children may not understand that reading a thermometer requires waiting for the liquid to stop moving before recording the value.

**Key vocabulary:** measure, standard unit, centimetre, metre, gram, kilogram, millilitre, litre, degrees Celsius, thermometer, data logger, accurate, systematic, scale, interval, reading

#### SC-KS2-C004 — Data Classification and Presentation
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Gathering, recording, classifying and presenting data in a variety of ways: simple scientific language, labelled diagrams, classification keys, bar charts, and tables. Moving from recording towards analytical presentation.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach each data presentation format explicitly: tables with headings and units, bar charts with labelled axes, and classification keys. Use sorting and grouping activities with real specimens (leaves, rocks, minibeasts) before introducing branching databases or keys. Model how to construct a bar chart step by step — choosing a scale, labelling axes, drawing bars accurately. Encourage pupils to select the most appropriate format for their data type (categories → bar chart, yes/no questions → classification key).

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often confuse bar charts with pictograms or line graphs and may draw bars that do not start from the baseline. Some pupils think a table is simply writing numbers in any arrangement — they need to understand that tables have clear headings, units and consistent formatting. Children may also believe that more elaborate presentation (colour, decoration) makes data 'better'.

**Key vocabulary:** table, bar chart, axis, label, scale, tally, key, classification key, data, record, present, category, diagram, heading, unit

#### SC-KS2-C005 — Drawing Conclusions and Predictions
Type: process | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Using results to draw simple conclusions, make predictions for new values, suggest improvements and raise further questions. Iterative development of scientific understanding through evidence-based reasoning.

**Teaching guidance:** Scaffold conclusion-writing with sentence starters: 'Our results show that...', 'This happened because...', 'If we changed X, I predict that...' Teach the difference between describing results (what happened) and explaining them (why it happened). Introduce prediction for new values by asking pupils to extend patterns — for example, 'If we tested a fourth surface, what do you think would happen based on our results?' Encourage pupils to identify when results are unexpected and to suggest reasons or further tests.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often restate their prediction as their conclusion regardless of what the data actually shows. They may confuse correlation with causation — for example, concluding that one thing caused another simply because they occurred together. Some pupils think that if their prediction was wrong, the investigation has 'failed', rather than understanding that disconfirming evidence is equally valuable in science.

**Key vocabulary:** conclusion, result, evidence, prediction, pattern, explain, because, support, suggest, further question, improve, unexpected, reason

#### SC-KS2-C006 — Scientific Reporting and Communication
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Reporting on findings from enquiries through oral and written explanations, displays and presentations. Using scientific language and illustrations to communicate findings to different audiences.

**Teaching guidance:** Provide opportunities for both oral and written reporting. Use 'science conferences' where groups present findings to the class, encouraging questions from the audience. Teach the structure of a scientific report: question, method, results, conclusion. Model the use of scientific vocabulary in explanations and provide word banks. Encourage pupils to use labelled diagrams and data displays as part of their communication, not just written prose.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often think that writing more equals better science communication. They need to understand that clarity and precision matter more than length. Some pupils believe that scientific reports should only contain text, not realising that diagrams, tables and charts are essential components of scientific communication.

**Key vocabulary:** report, findings, present, explain, scientific language, diagram, display, audience, evidence, method, results, conclusion, communicate

#### SC-KS2-C007 — Variable Control in Enquiry Planning
Type: process | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 4

Planning scientific enquiries by recognising and controlling variables where necessary. Understanding which variables to keep constant, which to change, and which to measure. Required for valid experimental design.

**Teaching guidance:** Use a structured planning template that requires pupils to explicitly name the independent variable (what I will change), the dependent variable (what I will measure), and the control variables (what I will keep the same). Provide practice in identifying variables across different contexts before asking pupils to plan independently. Use 'spot the error' activities where pupils critique a flawed investigation plan and identify uncontrolled variables. Connect variable control to the concept of reliability — explaining why uncontrolled variables make results untrustworthy.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often confuse the independent and dependent variables, or believe that 'keeping things the same' refers to getting the same results rather than controlling conditions. Some pupils think that controlling variables means nothing should change at all, not understanding that the independent variable must be deliberately changed. Upper KS2 pupils may struggle to identify hidden variables that they have not considered.

**Key vocabulary:** independent variable, dependent variable, control variable, plan, enquiry, method, reliable, valid, change, measure, keep the same, systematic, accuracy, precision

#### SC-KS2-C008 — Precision and Repeat Measurements
Type: skill | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 4

Taking measurements with increasing accuracy and precision using a range of scientific equipment. Understanding the value of repeat readings to improve reliability and identify anomalies.

**Teaching guidance:** Demonstrate the importance of repeat measurements by having different groups measure the same thing and comparing their results. Discuss why readings differ and how taking multiple measurements and calculating a mean improves reliability. Teach pupils to identify and discard anomalous results before calculating averages. Use contexts where precision matters — such as measuring the time for a pendulum swing or the distance a ball rolls — to motivate the need for careful, repeated measurement.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often confuse accuracy (closeness to the true value) with precision (consistency of repeat readings). Some pupils believe that taking more decimal places automatically makes a measurement more precise. Children may think that if their result differs from a classmate's, one of them must be 'wrong', rather than understanding natural variation in measurement.

**Key vocabulary:** precision, accuracy, repeat, reliable, anomaly, mean, average, measurement, reading, consistent, error, equipment, range, unit

#### SC-KS2-C009 — Complex Data Recording
Type: skill | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 4

Recording data and results of increasing complexity using scatter graphs, line graphs, bar charts, classification keys, tables and scientific diagrams. Selecting the most appropriate representation for different types of data.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce scatter graphs and line graphs as tools for continuous data, distinguishing them from bar charts used for categorical data. Teach pupils to plot points accurately and, where appropriate, draw lines of best fit. Provide opportunities to select the most suitable graph type for different investigations. Use ICT tools (spreadsheets, graphing software) alongside hand-drawn graphs. Model how to read information from graphs, including interpolating between data points and identifying trends.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often join scatter graph points dot-to-dot rather than drawing a line of best fit. They may confuse line graphs (for continuous data) with bar charts (for categorical data), using the wrong type for their data. Some pupils believe that a graph must always go through the origin (0,0), not understanding that this depends on the data.

**Key vocabulary:** scatter graph, line graph, bar chart, axis, scale, plot, data point, trend, line of best fit, classification key, table, continuous, categorical, interpret

#### SC-KS2-C010 — Causal Relationships and Evidence Evaluation
Type: process | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 4

Identifying causal relationships in data. Evaluating degree of trust in results. Identifying scientific evidence that supports or refutes ideas and arguments. Distinguishing opinion from fact in secondary sources.

**Teaching guidance:** Use investigations with clear causal links (e.g., increasing temperature speeds up dissolving) to model the difference between correlation and causation. Teach pupils to evaluate the trustworthiness of results by considering sample size, whether variables were controlled, and whether results are repeatable. Introduce the idea that scientific claims require evidence by examining real examples of scientific debate. Use newspaper or media science claims as stimuli for critical evaluation, asking 'What is the evidence? Is it strong enough?'

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils commonly assume that correlation implies causation — for example, that because ice cream sales and sunburn both increase in summer, ice cream causes sunburn. They may also believe that a single investigation provides definitive proof, rather than understanding that scientific conclusions become stronger with repeated, independent evidence. Some pupils struggle to distinguish between scientific evidence and personal opinion.

**Key vocabulary:** cause, effect, causal, correlation, evidence, evaluate, trust, reliable, secondary source, opinion, fact, argument, support, refute, scientific claim

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS2-D001-CL001:**
- **Cause and Effect** (primary): What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Fair testing and investigations are designed to isolate variables and establish causal relationships — the cognitive demand is reasoning from controlled evidence to causal claims.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Data from repeated investigations reveals patterns that allow pupils to generalise their findings beyond the specific test conditions.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

- **Evidence and Argument** (primary): What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: This cluster asks pupils to gather, record or communicate scientific findings — the core cognitive demand is evaluating what counts as valid evidence and how to present it clearly.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Scientific observations and enquiry serve to establish causal relationships; framing questions around 'what causes X' gives purpose to the observation work.

## Domain: SC-KS2-D002 — Plants
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
The Plants domain at KS2 builds on the introductory plant knowledge from KS1 to develop a scientific understanding of the life processes, nutrition and reproduction of plants. Pupils investigate how plants grow and are structured, learning about the functions of the root, stem, leaf and flower in the plant's life cycle. The statutory content requires pupils to explore what plants need for life and growth, to understand photosynthesis as the process by which plants make food from sunlight, water and carbon dioxide, and to understand the process of seed dispersal and pollination. Pupils investigate and observe the growing of plants from seeds and bulbs, developing their ability to conduct systematic observations over time and record changes.

### Concepts (6)

#### SC-KS2-C011 — Plant Part Functions
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that different parts of flowering plants have specific functions: roots (anchorage and water/nutrient uptake), stems/trunks (support and water transport), leaves (photosynthesis and gas exchange), flowers (reproduction). Structure-function relationship.

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate root function by growing plants in transparent containers so pupils observe root growth. Demonstrate water transport by placing white carnations or celery in coloured water and observing colour change in petals or leaves over 24 hours. Use leaf rubbings and close observation with hand lenses to explore leaf structure. Dissect flowers to connect flower parts to their reproductive function. Create annotated diagrams linking each plant part to its role: roots absorb water and anchor; stems transport water and support; leaves make food using light; flowers enable reproduction.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often think that roots only absorb water, not realising they also anchor the plant and absorb dissolved minerals. Many children believe that plants get their food from the soil rather than making it in their leaves through photosynthesis. Some pupils think all flowers are decorative and do not understand their essential reproductive function.

**Key vocabulary:** root, stem, leaf, flower, absorb, anchor, transport, support, photosynthesis, nutrition, reproduction, petal, stamen, carpel, pollen, function

#### SC-KS2-C012 — Plant Requirements for Life and Growth
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that plants need air, light, water, nutrients from soil, and room to grow. These requirements vary between plant species. Plants can make their own food (photosynthesis concept introduced without detailed mechanism).

**Teaching guidance:** Set up controlled investigations where plants are deprived of one requirement at a time — one group with no light, one with no water, one in a cold environment — while a control plant receives all requirements. Record observations over two to three weeks using a consistent observation schedule. Introduce the concept that plants make their own food using light (photosynthesis) without requiring the detailed mechanism. Compare plant nutrition with animal nutrition — plants make food, animals must eat. Discuss why different plants may need different amounts of light or water.

**Common misconceptions:** The most persistent misconception is that plants get their food from the soil. Plants make their own food through photosynthesis — they absorb water and minerals from the soil but these are raw materials, not food. Some children think plants only need sunlight and water, forgetting that air (carbon dioxide) is also essential. Children may believe that fertiliser is plant food rather than a mineral supplement.

**Key vocabulary:** light, water, air, nutrients, soil, temperature, photosynthesis, food, grow, healthy, survive, requirements, conditions, minerals, carbon dioxide

#### SC-KS2-C013 — Water Transport in Plants
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding that water is transported upward within plants through the stem to leaves and flowers. Observable through the coloured carnation investigation. Links root function to water availability and stem function to transport.

**Teaching guidance:** Conduct the classic coloured water investigation: place white carnations or celery sticks in water with food colouring and observe the results after several hours. Cut celery stalks crosswise to reveal the coloured transport vessels. Use magnifying glasses to examine the tiny tubes visible in cut stems. Connect this observation to the function of roots (absorbing water) and stems (transporting it upward). Discuss why plants wilt when they lack water — the transport system has nothing to carry.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often think water travels through the centre of the stem rather than through specialised tubes (xylem vessels) near the outside. Some children believe the plant 'sucks' water up like a straw, rather than understanding that water is drawn up by evaporation from the leaves (transpiration pull). Children may not connect wilting to water transport failure.

**Key vocabulary:** transport, water, stem, root, absorb, vessel, tube, upward, wilt, leaf, flower, nutrients, dissolved, minerals

#### SC-KS2-C014 — Flowering Plant Life Cycle **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 4 | Fan-out: 3

Understanding the complete life cycle of flowering plants: germination, growth, pollination, seed formation, seed dispersal, and back to germination. Understanding the role of flowers in reproduction and the variety of seed dispersal mechanisms.

**Teaching guidance:** Create a life cycle diagram as a circular flow chart, emphasising that it is a continuous cycle. Grow fast-cycling plants such as rapid-cycling brassicas (Wisconsin Fast Plants) that complete their life cycle in 35-40 days, allowing pupils to observe every stage. Dissect mature flowers to observe pollen and ovules. Collect seed heads and fruits to examine dispersal structures. Use time-lapse videos to show stages that are too slow to observe in real time. Compare the flowering plant life cycle with animal life cycles studied later.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think of a life cycle as linear (seed → plant → death) rather than circular. Some pupils believe all plants grow from seeds, not recognising that bulbs, tubers and runners are also starting points. Children may confuse pollination (transfer of pollen) with fertilisation (fusion of male and female cells) or use the terms interchangeably.

**Key vocabulary:** life cycle, germination, growth, pollination, fertilisation, seed formation, seed dispersal, flower, fruit, pollen, ovule, reproduce, mature, cycle

#### SC-KS2-C015 — Pollination
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding that pollination is the transfer of pollen between flowers, enabling seed formation. Part of the flowering plant reproductive cycle. Includes wind and insect pollination.

**Teaching guidance:** Examine flowers with hand lenses to identify the pollen-producing stamens and the pollen-receiving stigma. Compare insect-pollinated flowers (bright petals, scent, nectar, sticky pollen) with wind-pollinated flowers (small petals or none, large amounts of light pollen, feathery stigmas). Observe bees visiting flowers in the school garden if possible, discussing how pollen is transferred on their bodies. Use role-play or models to demonstrate pollen transfer between flowers. Link pollination to fruit and seed formation as the next stage in the plant life cycle.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often confuse pollination with seed dispersal or think pollination is the same as fertilisation. Some pupils believe bees deliberately collect pollen to help plants, rather than understanding that pollination is an incidental consequence of bees feeding on nectar. Children may think that all flowers are insect-pollinated, not recognising wind pollination in grasses and many trees.

**Key vocabulary:** pollination, pollen, stamen, stigma, anther, insect pollination, wind pollination, nectar, transfer, flower, bee, reproduce, fertilisation

#### SC-KS2-C016 — Seed Dispersal
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding that seeds are dispersed from parent plants by various mechanisms including wind, water, animals (internally and externally) and explosive mechanisms. Structure of fruits relates to dispersal method.

**Teaching guidance:** Collect a variety of seeds and fruits and challenge pupils to identify their dispersal mechanism by examining their structures. Examples: dandelion (wind — parachute), sycamore (wind — helicopter), burdock (animal — hooks), cherry (animal — eaten), coconut (water — floats), pea pod (explosive — springs open). Design and make seed dispersal models (paper helicopters, parachutes) and test which designs travel furthest. Discuss why dispersal away from the parent plant is advantageous — reduced competition for light, water and space.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think fruits are only the sweet edible items found in supermarkets. In biology, a fruit is any structure that contains seeds — including sycamore wings, conkers and pea pods. Some pupils believe seeds need to land on soil to grow, rather than understanding that seeds can germinate in many substrates if conditions are right. Children may not understand why dispersal is beneficial, thinking it would be better for seeds to stay near the parent plant.

**Key vocabulary:** seed dispersal, wind, water, animal, explosive, parachute, hook, fruit, scatter, spread, structure, mechanism, advantage, competition, germination

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS2-D002-CL001:**
- **Cause and Effect** (primary): What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Fair testing and investigations are designed to isolate variables and establish causal relationships — the cognitive demand is reasoning from controlled evidence to causal claims.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Data from repeated investigations reveals patterns that allow pupils to generalise their findings beyond the specific test conditions.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**SC-KS2-D002-CL002:**
- **Evidence and Argument** (primary): What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: This cluster asks pupils to gather, record or communicate scientific findings — the core cognitive demand is evaluating what counts as valid evidence and how to present it clearly.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Scientific observations and enquiry serve to establish causal relationships; framing questions around 'what causes X' gives purpose to the observation work.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

## Domain: SC-KS2-D003 — Animals, Including Humans
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Animals Including Humans at KS2 extends pupils' understanding from the basic needs and life processes studied at KS1 to a more detailed understanding of animal biology, nutrition, circulation and reproduction. Pupils learn about the digestive system and the role of nutrition in health, the structure and function of the skeletal and muscular systems, and the circulatory system including the heart and blood. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to investigate the effects of diet, exercise and lifestyle on health and wellbeing, and to understand how offspring inherit characteristics from parents through reproduction. By upper KS2, pupils understand the changes that occur as humans develop from birth to old age, providing a foundation for the more detailed human biology studied at KS3.

### Concepts (9)

#### SC-KS2-C017 — Animal Nutrition
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding that animals, including humans, require the right types and amounts of nutrition and cannot make their own food — they obtain nutrition from what they eat. Contrasts with plants which can make their own food.

**Teaching guidance:** Explore the concept that animals, unlike plants, cannot make their own food and must eat other organisms. Classify foods into food groups (carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, fibre, water) and discuss the role of each in the body. Compare the diets of different animals and relate diet to body structure and habitat. Use food packaging labels to identify nutrients. Emphasise the contrast with plants — animals are consumers, plants are producers. Link to the concept of a balanced diet and why variety matters for health.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often think 'nutrition' means only eating healthy food, rather than understanding it as the process of obtaining the substances needed for growth and energy. Some children believe that fat and carbohydrates are always 'bad' rather than essential in appropriate amounts. Children may not understand the fundamental difference between plant and animal nutrition — that plants make their food while animals must consume it.

**Key vocabulary:** nutrition, nutrient, carbohydrate, protein, fat, vitamin, mineral, fibre, balanced diet, food group, energy, consumer, producer, diet, health

#### SC-KS2-C018 — Skeletal and Muscular Systems
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that humans and some other animals have skeletons for support, protection and movement. Muscles are attached to bones and enable movement by contracting and relaxing. Different body parts have different skeletal structures suited to their functions.

**Teaching guidance:** Use life-sized skeleton models or posters to identify major bones: skull, ribs, spine, pelvis, femur, humerus. Ask pupils to feel their own bones through their skin to connect the model to their bodies. Demonstrate how joints allow movement by comparing hinge joints (elbow, knee) with ball-and-socket joints (shoulder, hip). Use elastic bands attached to cardboard tubes to model how muscles pull on bones — showing that muscles can only pull (contract), not push. Investigate which animals have endoskeletons, exoskeletons, or no skeleton, and discuss the advantages of each.

**Common misconceptions:** Children commonly think muscles both push and pull — in reality, muscles can only contract (pull) and work in antagonistic pairs to produce movement in both directions. Some pupils believe the skeleton is a dead, rigid structure rather than living tissue that grows and repairs. Children may not realise that some animals (insects, crabs) have their skeleton on the outside (exoskeleton) and that some animals (worms, jellyfish) have no skeleton at all.

**Key vocabulary:** skeleton, bone, muscle, joint, skull, ribs, spine, pelvis, femur, support, protect, movement, contract, relax, endoskeleton, exoskeleton, hinge, ball-and-socket

#### SC-KS2-C031 — Digestive System
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding the functions of the basic parts of the human digestive system: mouth (chewing, saliva), oesophagus (transport), stomach (churning, digestion), small intestine (nutrient absorption), large intestine (water absorption). Food is broken down to release nutrients.

**Teaching guidance:** Use a large-scale diagram or model of the digestive system for pupils to trace the journey of food from mouth to large intestine. Create a physical simulation using a plastic bag (stomach) with bread and orange juice to show churning and chemical breakdown. Use tights filled with mashed banana to demonstrate the squeezing action of the oesophagus (peristalsis). Label the key organs and their functions: mouth (chewing and saliva), oesophagus (muscular tube), stomach (acid and churning), small intestine (nutrient absorption), large intestine (water absorption). Link to nutrition — digestion breaks food down so nutrients can be absorbed into the blood.

**Common misconceptions:** Children commonly think the stomach is the main organ of digestion, when in fact most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption occurs in the small intestine. Some pupils believe food passes through the body in one tube with the stomach at the bottom, rather than understanding the winding path through distinct organs with different functions. Children may think digestion is only mechanical (chewing), not understanding the role of chemical breakdown by enzymes and acid.

**Key vocabulary:** digestive system, mouth, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, saliva, chew, digest, absorb, nutrient, enzyme, acid, peristalsis, breakdown, organ

#### SC-KS2-C032 — Types and Functions of Teeth
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding that humans have different types of teeth with different functions: incisors (cutting), canines (tearing), premolars and molars (grinding). Diet of carnivores and herbivores relates to different tooth structures.

**Teaching guidance:** Examine real or model teeth to identify the four types: incisors (flat, sharp, at the front — for cutting and biting), canines (pointed — for tearing), premolars and molars (flat, broad — for crushing and grinding). Use mirrors for pupils to examine their own teeth and identify each type. Compare human teeth with those of herbivores (flat, ridged molars for grinding plants) and carnivores (large canines and carnassials for tearing meat). Link tooth type to diet and feeding behaviour. Discuss dental health: the role of bacteria and sugar in tooth decay, and how brushing and diet protect teeth. Consider using disclosing tablets to show plaque.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think humans have only two types of teeth (front teeth and back teeth) rather than four types with distinct functions. Some pupils believe that baby teeth do not matter because they will fall out, not understanding that decay can affect the permanent teeth developing beneath. Children may think herbivores have no sharp teeth at all — in fact, many herbivores have sharp incisors for cutting grass and leaves.

**Key vocabulary:** incisor, canine, premolar, molar, cut, tear, grind, crush, tooth, teeth, enamel, decay, dentine, pulp, root, crown, carnivore, herbivore, omnivore, plaque

#### SC-KS2-C033 — Food Chains with Producers, Predators and Prey
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Constructing and interpreting food chains that include producers (plants), consumers, predators and prey. Understanding that food chains show the flow of energy and that producers are always the starting point. Extends KS1 simple food chains.

**Teaching guidance:** Build food chains using real organisms from a local habitat, starting with a producer (green plant) and showing energy flow through arrows. Emphasise that the arrow means 'is eaten by' or 'provides energy for', not 'eats'. Introduce the terms producer, consumer, predator and prey explicitly. Construct multiple food chains from the same habitat and discuss what happens if one organism is removed — does the chain collapse? Use food chain card games where pupils assemble chains from shuffled organism cards. Link to habitats work and classification.

**Common misconceptions:** The most common error is drawing food chain arrows in the wrong direction — arrows should point from the organism being eaten to the organism doing the eating, showing the direction of energy flow. Children often think predators are always large, fierce animals and do not recognise that a ladybird eating an aphid is also a predator-prey relationship. Some pupils believe removing one organism from a food chain only affects the organism directly above or below it, not understanding the cascading effects.

**Key vocabulary:** food chain, producer, consumer, predator, prey, energy, arrow, habitat, organism, plant, herbivore, carnivore, top predator, population, depend

#### SC-KS2-C046 — Human Development and Ageing
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding the full sequence of human development from birth through childhood, puberty, adulthood and old age. Changes at puberty are introduced. Timeline of growth stages. Gestation period concept.

**Teaching guidance:** Create a human timeline showing the stages from birth through infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood and old age, using photographs to illustrate each stage. Discuss the physical changes at each stage — growth in height and weight, development of teeth, puberty changes (growth spurts, body shape changes, development of secondary sexual characteristics). Handle puberty sensitively, following school RSE policy and ensuring a safe environment for questions. Compare human development timelines with those of other animals — some develop rapidly (mice), others slowly (elephants). Discuss gestation periods of different mammals.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think puberty happens at the same age for everyone, not understanding that there is a wide normal range (typically 8-14 for onset). Some pupils believe that growing old means the body simply wears out, rather than understanding that ageing involves specific biological processes. Children may not recognise that human development is much slower than most other mammals — a cat reaches adulthood in about one year.

**Key vocabulary:** development, growth, baby, toddler, child, adolescent, teenager, adult, elderly, puberty, gestation, stage, life span, ageing, mature, reproduce

#### SC-KS2-C060 — Circulatory System
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding the main parts of the human circulatory system: heart (pump), blood vessels (arteries carry oxygenated blood from heart, veins return deoxygenated blood, capillaries enable exchange). Blood transports nutrients, oxygen and waste. Functions of each component.

**Teaching guidance:** Use a large diagram or 3D model of the heart showing its chambers, valves and connected blood vessels. Demonstrate the pumping action by squeezing a rubber ball to simulate heartbeats. Measure pulse rate before and after exercise to show the heart responds to the body's needs. Trace the route of blood: heart → arteries → capillaries (where exchange occurs) → veins → heart → lungs (for oxygen) → heart. Use red and blue to distinguish oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in diagrams. Discuss the role of blood in transporting oxygen, nutrients and waste. Link to the respiratory system — the lungs oxygenate blood before it returns to the heart.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think the heart is on the left side of the chest — it is actually roughly central, slightly to the left. Some pupils believe blood is blue in veins and red in arteries — blood is always red; deoxygenated blood is dark red, not blue (veins appear blue through the skin due to how light penetrates tissue). Children may think the heart only pumps blood one way, not understanding the double circulation through the lungs and around the body.

**Key vocabulary:** heart, blood, blood vessel, artery, vein, capillary, pump, oxygenated, deoxygenated, oxygen, circulatory system, pulse, chamber, valve, lung, transport, cell

#### SC-KS2-C061 — Diet, Exercise, Drugs and Lifestyle
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding that diet, exercise, drugs and lifestyle choices affect how the body functions. Both beneficial choices (regular exercise, balanced diet) and harmful choices (drugs, poor diet) have impacts on body function and health.

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate the effects of exercise on heart rate and breathing rate through practical measurement — measure resting pulse, exercise for 2 minutes, then measure pulse again at intervals. Discuss the components of a balanced diet using the Eatwell Guide, linking nutrient types to body functions (protein for growth and repair, carbohydrates for energy, fats for insulation and energy). Discuss the impact of harmful substances — tobacco on lungs and circulation, alcohol on the liver and brain — using age-appropriate resources. Explore lifestyle choices: sleep, hydration, mental health. Use case studies or role-play scenarios where characters make different lifestyle choices and discuss the consequences.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think 'drugs' only refers to illegal substances, not understanding that medicines, caffeine and alcohol are also drugs. Some pupils believe that exercise is only beneficial if you are overweight, rather than understanding its benefits for cardiovascular health, mental health and bone strength regardless of weight. Children may think a 'balanced diet' means eating equal amounts of all food groups, rather than proportions recommended in the Eatwell Guide.

**Key vocabulary:** diet, exercise, balanced, healthy, nutrient, drug, tobacco, alcohol, lifestyle, heart rate, breathing rate, energy, protein, carbohydrate, fat, vitamin, organ, wellbeing

#### SC-KS2-C062 — Nutrient and Water Transport in Animals
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding that the circulatory system transports nutrients (absorbed from the small intestine) and water to all cells in the body. Blood is the transport medium. This links the digestive system output to the circulatory system.

**Teaching guidance:** Link the digestive system (studied in Y4) to the circulatory system: nutrients absorbed through the wall of the small intestine enter the blood and are transported to cells throughout the body. Use diagrams showing blood capillaries surrounding the small intestine to illustrate absorption. Discuss what happens to water — absorbed mainly in the large intestine and transported by blood. Trace the journey of a nutrient molecule from food on the plate through digestion, absorption, transport in blood and delivery to a cell. This concept bridges Y4 digestion knowledge with Y6 circulation knowledge, building an integrated understanding of body systems working together.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think food goes directly from the stomach to the rest of the body without understanding the role of the small intestine in absorption and the blood in transport. Some pupils believe the body uses food in its original form (e.g., a piece of bread reaching the muscles) rather than understanding that food must be broken down into tiny dissolved nutrient molecules. Children may not connect the digestive and circulatory systems as working together.

**Key vocabulary:** nutrient, water, transport, blood, circulatory system, digestive system, absorb, small intestine, large intestine, cell, capillary, dissolve, deliver, oxygen, waste, organ system

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS2-D003-CL001:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Body parts, organs and systems are understood by connecting their physical structure to their biological function — why is the heart shaped as it is, and how does that shape enable pumping?
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Systems and System Models**: What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Bodily systems (circulatory, digestive, skeletal) are interacting systems; tracing inputs, outputs and feedback between them deepens the structural understanding.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'

**SC-KS2-D003-CL002:**
- **Evidence and Argument** (primary): What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: This science cluster requires pupils to gather observations, evaluate their reliability, and construct evidence-based conclusions — the core of scientific thinking.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Understanding natural phenomena involves identifying causal mechanisms; pupils ask why things happen and what would change if conditions were different.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

**SC-KS2-D003-CL003:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?

  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Stability and Change**: What keeps this stable, what causes change, and how quickly does change happen?
  Why: Ecosystems maintain dynamic equilibria that can be disrupted by changes to one component — exploring what keeps the system stable and what destabilises it is an equally powerful framing.
  AI instruction: Use the STABILITY AND CHANGE lens: prompt pupils to identify what conditions keep a system in balance, what disrupts equilibrium, and how change can be gradual or sudden. Useful questions: 'What keeps this the same?', 'What would tip it into change?', 'Is the change reversible?', 'How fast is this changing, and why?'

## Domain: SC-KS2-D004 — Rocks
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
The Rocks domain introduces pupils to the geological materials that make up the Earth's surface, providing a foundation for understanding Earth processes, the rock cycle and the fossil record. Pupils compare and group rocks on the basis of their appearance and physical properties, and learn to distinguish between sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic rocks. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to describe how fossils are formed and understand what they tell us about living things that existed millions of years ago, connecting palaeontology to the concept of evolution. Pupils also study soil, understanding its composition and the role of living organisms and weathering processes in soil formation.

### Concepts (3)

#### SC-KS2-C019 — Rock Classification
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that rocks can be grouped and compared based on appearance and physical properties such as grain size, crystal structure, hardness, porosity, and whether they contain fossils. Examples: igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic (informal introduction).

**Teaching guidance:** Provide a collection of rock samples for hands-on investigation. Test rocks for hardness (scratch test), permeability (water drop test), appearance (crystal/grain examination with hand lens), and reaction to acid (vinegar test for limestone). Use the tests to group rocks rather than simply memorising names. Introduce the three rock types informally: rocks formed from cooled magma (igneous, e.g., granite, basalt), rocks formed from compressed layers (sedimentary, e.g., sandstone, chalk, limestone), and rocks changed by heat and pressure (metamorphic, e.g., marble, slate). Link to local geology where possible.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think all rocks are hard and heavy — pumice floats on water, chalk crumbles easily. Some pupils believe rocks are unchanging and permanent, not understanding that rocks are slowly broken down by weathering and reformed over geological time. Children may confuse rocks with minerals, or think that 'sedimentary' means the rock contains mud rather than understanding the process of layers being compressed.

**Key vocabulary:** rock, mineral, grain, crystal, hard, soft, permeable, sedimentary, igneous, metamorphic, limestone, sandstone, granite, chalk, slate, marble, fossil, appearance, property

#### SC-KS2-C020 — Fossil Formation
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding in simple terms how fossils are formed when the remains or traces of living things are trapped within sedimentary rock over millions of years. Fossils provide evidence of past life on Earth.

**Teaching guidance:** Use a layered modelling activity to demonstrate fossil formation: press plastic animals or shells into soft clay or plaster of Paris, then layer 'sediment' on top. Discuss the timescale — millions of years — and why only hard parts (bones, shells, teeth) typically fossilise. Examine real or replica fossils and ask pupils to identify which living things they came from. Discuss Mary Anning's contributions to palaeontology as a historical case study. Link fossil evidence to the concept that Earth has changed over time and that organisms that lived long ago may differ from those alive today.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think fossils are the actual bones of the animal rather than mineralised replacements or impressions in rock. Some pupils believe dinosaur bones are found complete and assembled, rather than as scattered fragments requiring reconstruction. Children may not grasp the immense timescales involved — they tend to underestimate geological time by orders of magnitude.

**Key vocabulary:** fossil, remains, sediment, sedimentary rock, preserved, impression, millions of years, palaeontologist, evidence, extinct, organism, shell, bone, trace, decay

#### SC-KS2-C021 — Soil Composition
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that soils are made from rock particles (formed by weathering) and organic matter (decayed living material). Different soils have different properties depending on their rock and organic matter composition.

**Teaching guidance:** Collect soil samples from different locations around the school grounds and compare them. Shake soil in water to separate layers — gravel sinks first, then sand, then silt, with organic material floating. Use hand lenses to examine soil closely and identify fragments of rock, decayed leaves, roots and small organisms. Discuss how soil forms from the breakdown of rocks (physical and chemical weathering) combined with decomposed plant and animal material. Connect to the rock cycle and the role of living organisms (earthworms, fungi, bacteria) in soil formation.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think soil is just 'dirt' with no particular composition or structure. Some pupils believe soil has always existed and do not connect it to the breakdown of rocks. Children may not realise that soil contains living organisms — bacteria, fungi, worms — that are essential for its formation and fertility. Some pupils think all soils are the same, not recognising that different soils have different properties.

**Key vocabulary:** soil, rock, particle, sand, silt, clay, organic matter, humus, weathering, decompose, earthworm, mineral, erosion, fertile, layer, compost

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS2-D004-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Sorting, classifying and identifying similarities directly trains pupils to recognise regularities and use them to predict or generalise.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Evidence and Argument**: What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Drawing conclusions from observations requires constructing a claim supported by specific evidence — not just describing what was seen.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'

**SC-KS2-D004-CL002:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Earth science topics involve large-scale systems (water cycle, solar system, rock cycle) where components interact in cycles — mapping the system helps pupils understand processes they cannot directly observe.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Stability and Change**: What keeps this stable, what causes change, and how quickly does change happen?
  Why: Geological, atmospheric and astronomical systems exhibit both stability (seasons repeat, rock types persist) and change (erosion, climate shifts), making stability-and-change a productive alternative framing.
  AI instruction: Use the STABILITY AND CHANGE lens: prompt pupils to identify what conditions keep a system in balance, what disrupts equilibrium, and how change can be gradual or sudden. Useful questions: 'What keeps this the same?', 'What would tip it into change?', 'Is the change reversible?', 'How fast is this changing, and why?'

### Objectives (3)
- SC-KS2-O022 [statutory]: compare and group together different kinds of rocks on the basis of their appearance and simple physical properties

### Content Vehicles — Teaching Packs (1)
These are choosable teaching packs that deliver concepts in this domain. Teachers select the pack that fits their class.

#### SC-KS2-CV003 — Rocks and Fossils (investigation)
Observation and classification enquiry — pupils examine, group, and compare rocks based on observable properties, then explore fossil formation and soil composition.
Delivers: SC-KS2-C004, SC-KS2-C019, SC-KS2-C020, SC-KS2-C021
Enquiry type: identifying_and_classifying
Equipment: rock samples (granite, chalk, sandstone, slate, marble), hand lenses, vinegar (acid test for chalk), scratch test tools, fossil samples
Expected outcome: Pupils classify rocks by hardness, appearance, and reaction to acid. They understand that fossils form in sedimentary rock and that soil contains rock fragments plus organic material.
Key vocabulary: igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic, fossil, soil, mineral, permeable, erosion
Assessment: Can pupils group rocks using observable properties (hardness, grain, permeability)? Can they explain the three main rock types? Can they describe how fossils form in sedimentary rock? Can they explain what soil is made of?
Success criteria: Group rocks by at least 3 observable properties; Name the three main rock types with an example of each; Describe the process of fossil formation in sequence; Explain that soil is made from rock fragments and organic material

## Domain: SC-KS2-D005 — Light
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
The Light domain at KS2 requires pupils to understand light as a physical phenomenon — how it is produced, how it travels and how it interacts with materials. Pupils discover that light travels in straight lines and that we see because light enters the eye, correcting common misconceptions from younger years. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to investigate how shadows are formed and how their size and shape relate to the position of the light source, and to understand reflection as the mechanism by which mirrors and smooth surfaces change the direction of light. Pupils also explore how light is refracted, providing the conceptual foundation for understanding how lenses and optical instruments work.

### Concepts (4)

#### SC-KS2-C022 — Light and Vision
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that light is needed to see — dark is the absence of light. In Year 3, this is the observable phenomenon; in Year 6, it is explained using the model that light travels in straight lines from sources to eyes or via reflection.

**Teaching guidance:** Create a dark den or use a blacked-out area to explore the concept that we need light to see. Demonstrate that in complete darkness we cannot see at all — dark is the absence of light, not a substance. Introduce the idea that we see objects because light from a source reaches our eyes — either directly from a light source (sun, lamp, candle) or after reflecting off objects. Discuss sun safety: never look directly at the sun. Compare objects that produce their own light (luminous — sun, torch, candle) with those that reflect light (non-luminous — moon, most objects).

**Common misconceptions:** The most common misconception is that we can see in complete darkness if we 'wait long enough for our eyes to adjust'. In complete darkness (no light at all), we cannot see anything. Children often believe the Moon produces its own light — it reflects sunlight. Some pupils think darkness is a substance that can be 'pushed away' by light, rather than understanding darkness as the absence of light.

**Key vocabulary:** light, dark, light source, luminous, reflect, shadow, see, eye, torch, candle, sun, absence, visible, darkness, bright, dim

#### SC-KS2-C023 — Reflection of Light
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that light is reflected from surfaces, including mirrors and other reflective materials. In Year 3 this is observed; in Year 6 it is explained using the straight-line travel model.

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate reflection using mirrors, torches and darkened rooms. Show that shiny, smooth surfaces (mirrors, foil, still water) reflect light well, while rough or dark surfaces reflect less light. Use mirrors to redirect a torch beam around obstacles. Introduce the idea that we see most objects because light bounces off them into our eyes — even non-shiny objects reflect some light. Compare reflections in flat mirrors (clear image) with curved mirrors (distorted image). Connect to everyday applications: bicycle reflectors, reflective clothing, cat's eyes on roads.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think that only shiny objects like mirrors reflect light. In fact, all visible objects reflect some light — that is how we see them. Some pupils believe that light only comes from very bright sources and do not recognise that a candle or even a glow-worm is a light source. Children may think reflection only occurs in mirrors, not understanding that water, polished floors and even walls reflect light.

**Key vocabulary:** reflect, reflection, mirror, surface, shiny, smooth, light, bounce, torch, image, beam, direction, reflective, visible, angle

#### SC-KS2-C024 — Shadow Formation
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that shadows are formed when light from a source is blocked by an opaque object. In Year 3, the pattern of shadow size changes is explored. In Year 6, shadow shape is explained using the straight-line travel model.

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate shadows using torches and opaque objects in a darkened area. Explore how shadow size changes with the distance between the light source and the object — closer to the light makes a larger shadow, closer to the screen makes a smaller shadow. Investigate how shadow shape relates to the shape of the object. Classify materials as opaque (blocks all light, creates shadow), translucent (lets some light through, creates faint shadow) or transparent (lets most light through, no shadow). In Year 6, revisit shadows and explain their sharp edges using the model that light travels in straight lines.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think shadows have colour or are reflections of objects rather than areas where light has been blocked. Some pupils believe shadows are always the same size as the object, not understanding how distance from the light source affects shadow size. Children may think transparent objects have no effect on light at all, when in fact they can refract (bend) light passing through them.

**Key vocabulary:** shadow, opaque, translucent, transparent, light source, block, screen, shape, size, dark, bright, edge, outline, torch, distance

#### SC-KS2-C067 — Light Travels in Straight Lines
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

The explanatory model that light travels in straight lines from sources. This model explains why we see objects (light reaches our eyes directly from sources or via reflection), why shadows have the same shape as the object casting them, and how optical instruments work.

**Teaching guidance:** Demonstrate that light travels in straight lines by shining a torch through a series of cards with holes — the light only reaches the end if all holes are aligned. Use laser pointers (teacher-operated, safely) in a dusty or misty room to show the straight beam. Apply the straight-line model to explain how shadows have the same shape as the opaque object — draw ray diagrams showing light blocked by the object. Explain how we see objects: light from a source reflects off an object and travels in a straight line to our eyes. Use ray diagrams to model this process. Revisit shadow formation from Y3 and explain it using this model.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think light travels from the eye to the object (emission theory) rather than from the object to the eye. This misconception has deep historical roots and is very persistent. Some pupils believe light can bend around corners — it cannot without a reflective or refractive surface. Children may think shadows are dark because they contain something (a dark substance) rather than understanding that a shadow is simply an area where light does not reach.

**Key vocabulary:** light, straight line, ray, beam, source, reflect, eye, shadow, opaque, ray diagram, travel, block, illuminate, direction, model, refract

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS2-D005-CL001:**
- **Cause and Effect** (primary): What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Fair testing and investigations are designed to isolate variables and establish causal relationships — the cognitive demand is reasoning from controlled evidence to causal claims.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Data from repeated investigations reveals patterns that allow pupils to generalise their findings beyond the specific test conditions.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

## Domain: SC-KS2-D006 — Forces and Magnets
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Forces and Magnets at KS2 introduces pupils to the concept of force as an interaction between objects, progressing from the intuitive, qualitative understanding of push and pull in KS1 to a more systematic, measurable account. Pupils investigate how objects move on different surfaces, understanding friction as a force that opposes motion, and explore the properties of magnets — attraction, repulsion and the existence of magnetic fields. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to distinguish between contact forces (friction, air resistance, water resistance) and non-contact forces (gravity, magnetic and electrostatic forces), comparing how objects move on different surfaces. This foundational understanding of forces prepares pupils for the more mathematical treatment of Newton's laws at KS3.

### Concepts (3)

#### SC-KS2-C025 — Contact and Non-Contact Forces
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that most forces require direct contact between objects (e.g., pushing, pulling, friction) but some forces, notably magnetic forces and gravity, can act at a distance without direct contact.

**Teaching guidance:** Explore contact forces through practical activities: pushing and pulling objects, observing friction between surfaces, and feeling the resistance of water when moving objects through it. Introduce non-contact forces using magnets (attraction and repulsion without touching) and dropping objects (gravity pulls without touching). Create a two-column sorting activity: 'forces that need touching' versus 'forces that act at a distance'. Use force arrows to represent the direction of forces on simple diagrams. Discuss everyday examples of both types.

**Common misconceptions:** Children commonly think a force is needed to keep an object moving, rather than understanding that forces are needed to start, stop or change movement (a precursor to Newton's first law). Some pupils believe gravity only acts on heavy objects or only works at large distances. Children may think that magnetic force requires contact because they usually see magnets touching metal objects — they need to explore magnetic attraction through materials and at a distance.

**Key vocabulary:** force, push, pull, contact, non-contact, friction, gravity, magnetic, attract, repel, distance, surface, direction, strength, interaction

#### SC-KS2-C026 — Magnetic Properties
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that magnets attract some materials (magnetic materials, principally metals containing iron, nickel or cobalt) and not others. Magnets have two poles (north and south); like poles repel and unlike poles attract. Magnetic force acts at a distance.

**Teaching guidance:** Provide a collection of magnets (bar, horseshoe, ring) and a variety of materials for systematic testing. Challenge pupils to predict and then test which materials are attracted to magnets, recording results in a table. Investigate magnetic poles: demonstrate that like poles repel and unlike poles attract using bar magnets on a smooth surface or suspended from string. Explore the magnetic field using iron filings on paper above a bar magnet. Test whether magnetic force acts through materials (paper, wood, plastic, water) by trying to move a paper clip through a table. Investigate which metals are magnetic — only iron, nickel and cobalt, not all metals.

**Common misconceptions:** The most widespread misconception is that all metals are magnetic. Only iron, nickel, cobalt and their alloys (e.g., steel) are magnetic — copper, aluminium, gold and silver are not. Children often think magnets are strongest in the middle rather than at the poles. Some pupils believe bigger magnets are always stronger than smaller ones, which is not necessarily true as strength depends on the material and magnetisation.

**Key vocabulary:** magnet, magnetic, attract, repel, pole, north, south, iron, nickel, cobalt, force, field, material, metal, non-magnetic, bar magnet, horseshoe magnet

#### SC-KS2-C027 — Friction and Movement on Surfaces
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that the surface of an object affects how it moves — rough surfaces produce more friction and slow objects down more than smooth surfaces. Friction is a contact force.

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate friction by rolling a toy car down a ramp onto different surfaces (carpet, sandpaper, smooth wood, lino) and measuring the distance it travels. Use force meters to pull objects across different surfaces and compare the readings. Discuss why shoes have treads, why tyres have grip patterns, and why ice is slippery. Explore the idea that friction can be both useful (brakes, grip) and a nuisance (wear, heat, slowing down). Connect to the concept that rougher surfaces produce more friction than smoother ones.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think that smooth objects have no friction at all, rather than understanding that all surfaces produce some friction when in contact. Some pupils believe friction only slows things down and do not recognise its essential role in enabling movement — without friction, we could not walk, drive or hold objects. Children may think friction is only related to the roughness of surfaces, not understanding that weight and surface area also play a role.

**Key vocabulary:** friction, surface, rough, smooth, grip, slide, resistance, force, contact, ramp, distance, slow down, speed up, useful, nuisance, force meter

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS2-D006-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Sorting, classifying and identifying similarities directly trains pupils to recognise regularities and use them to predict or generalise.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Evidence and Argument**: What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Drawing conclusions from observations requires constructing a claim supported by specific evidence — not just describing what was seen.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'

**SC-KS2-D006-CL002:**
- **Cause and Effect** (primary): What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Fair testing and investigations are designed to isolate variables and establish causal relationships — the cognitive demand is reasoning from controlled evidence to causal claims.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Data from repeated investigations reveals patterns that allow pupils to generalise their findings beyond the specific test conditions.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

## Domain: SC-KS2-D007 — Living Things and Their Habitats
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Living Things and Their Habitats at KS2 develops pupils' ecological understanding, moving from the simple identification of living and non-living things at KS1 to an understanding of the relationships between organisms and their environments. Pupils classify living things into broad groups (plants, animals, fungi, micro-organisms) using observable characteristics, and understand how classification systems are constructed and used by scientists. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to explore how habitats provide for the basic needs of different organisms, to construct and interpret food chains, and to understand how changes to an environment can affect the living things that depend on it. Pupils are introduced to the concepts of producer, consumer, predator and prey.

### Concepts (7)

#### SC-KS2-C028 — Classification Keys
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Using and making simple branching keys (dichotomous keys) to identify and classify living things by asking yes/no questions about observable characteristics. An important tool in biological identification.

**Teaching guidance:** Begin with teacher-made branching keys that pupils use to identify specimens (leaves, minibeasts, shells). Progress to pupils creating their own keys by choosing yes/no questions based on observable characteristics. Start with familiar objects (e.g., sorting classroom items) before moving to living organisms. Emphasise that good key questions focus on observable, unambiguous features rather than subjective qualities. Use local habitats for fieldwork — identify organisms found in the school grounds using published keys, then create a key for the organisms found.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often write key questions based on subjective criteria ('Is it pretty?') rather than observable, measurable features ('Does it have more than six legs?'). Some children think a key must lead to only one correct answer at each branch, not understanding that keys are tools for narrowing down possibilities based on available evidence. Children may confuse classification keys with identification guides that use pictures rather than questions.

**Key vocabulary:** classification key, branching key, dichotomous, identify, characteristic, feature, observable, yes/no, question, group, sort, organism, specimen, distinguish

#### SC-KS2-C029 — Variety of Classification Criteria
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding that living things can be grouped in many different ways depending on the characteristics chosen as criteria. No single correct grouping — different criteria produce different and equally valid classifications.

**Teaching guidance:** Provide the same set of organisms (or pictures) and challenge groups to classify them using different criteria: habitat, diet, body covering, number of legs, method of reproduction. Compare the different groupings that result and discuss which are most useful for different purposes. Introduce the idea that scientists choose classification criteria carefully and that the system we use today is based on evolutionary relationships. Use Venn diagrams and Carroll diagrams to explore overlapping and non-overlapping criteria. Discuss why some organisms are difficult to classify.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think there is only one correct way to classify organisms, not recognising that different criteria produce different but equally valid groupings. Some pupils classify animals by where they live rather than by biological features — for example, grouping whales with fish because they live in water. Children may struggle with organisms that do not fit neatly into one group, such as platypuses (mammals that lay eggs).

**Key vocabulary:** classify, group, criteria, characteristic, feature, similar, different, sort, compare, habitat, structure, Venn diagram, Carroll diagram, category, organism

#### SC-KS2-C030 — Environmental Change and Impact
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding that environments change over time (seasonal changes, human impact) and that these changes can sometimes pose dangers to living things. Includes positive and negative human impacts on environments.

**Teaching guidance:** Study a local habitat over time and record seasonal changes in the organisms present. Discuss both positive human impacts (nature reserves, reforestation, wildlife corridors) and negative impacts (pollution, deforestation, littering, urbanisation). Use case studies of environmental change — for example, the effect of hedgerow removal on bird populations, or the impact of river pollution on aquatic invertebrates. Investigate how changes in one part of a food chain affect other organisms. Link to geography work on land use and sustainability.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think environmental change is always negative and caused by humans, not recognising that natural changes (seasons, flooding, volcanic eruptions) also affect habitats. Some pupils believe that if an animal's habitat is destroyed, it can simply move to another habitat without difficulty. Children may not understand that changes to one species in a food chain have knock-on effects for other species in the same ecosystem.

**Key vocabulary:** environment, habitat, change, impact, pollution, deforestation, conservation, endangered, extinct, human, positive, negative, food chain, population, adapt, seasonal

#### SC-KS2-C044 — Comparative Life Cycles
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5 | Fan-out: 2

Describing and comparing the life cycles of four types of animals: mammals (live birth, parental care), amphibians (metamorphosis, aquatic larval stage), insects (complete or incomplete metamorphosis), birds (eggs, hatching, fledging). Understanding variety within the concept of life cycle.

**Teaching guidance:** Compare life cycles of mammals (e.g., human — live birth, extended parental care), amphibians (e.g., frog — eggs → tadpole → froglet → adult frog, metamorphosis), insects (e.g., butterfly — egg → caterpillar → chrysalis → butterfly, complete metamorphosis), and birds (e.g., robin — eggs → chick → fledgling → adult, hatching). Use diagrams to show each life cycle as a circular process. Create comparison tables highlighting similarities and differences. If possible, observe real life cycles — frog spawn developing, caterpillars pupating, chick eggs hatching. Discuss why different animals have evolved such different strategies.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think metamorphosis only applies to butterflies, not recognising it in frogs, beetles, and many other animals. Some pupils believe all animals are born as miniature versions of the adult (like mammals), not understanding that many go through dramatically different larval stages. Children may think a chrysalis is a resting state where nothing happens, rather than understanding that major body restructuring occurs inside.

**Key vocabulary:** life cycle, mammal, amphibian, insect, bird, metamorphosis, larva, pupa, tadpole, chrysalis, caterpillar, egg, hatch, fledgling, adult, offspring, gestation, stage

#### SC-KS2-C045 — Reproduction in Plants and Animals
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding the life process of reproduction. In plants: sexual reproduction (pollination, fertilisation, seed formation) and asexual reproduction (runners, bulbs, cuttings, tubers). In animals: sexual reproduction. Understanding that reproduction maintains species.

**Teaching guidance:** Distinguish between sexual reproduction (two parents, offspring show variation) and asexual reproduction (one parent, offspring genetically identical to parent). For plants: review pollination and seed formation as sexual reproduction, then investigate asexual methods — take cuttings from geraniums, plant strawberry runners, grow new plants from potato tubers and garlic bulbs. For animals: discuss sexual reproduction without detailed mechanism (appropriate to Y5). Compare sexual and asexual reproduction in terms of the variety of offspring produced. Link to evolution — sexual reproduction produces variation, which is the raw material for natural selection.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think all reproduction requires two parents, not understanding that many organisms (plants, some animals) can reproduce asexually. Some pupils confuse growth with reproduction — a plant getting bigger is growth, not reproduction. Children may believe that cuttings from a plant will produce a different variety of plant rather than an identical clone of the parent.

**Key vocabulary:** reproduction, sexual, asexual, offspring, parent, variation, identical, pollination, fertilisation, seed, cutting, runner, tuber, bulb, clone, species, inherit

#### SC-KS2-C058 — Formal Biological Classification
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding the formal biological classification system: broad groups of living things (micro-organisms, plants, animals) can be subdivided. Animals classified as vertebrates (fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals) and invertebrates. Plants classified as flowering and non-flowering. Based on work of Carl Linnaeus.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce Linnaeus and his contribution to biological classification. Use a classification hierarchy diagram showing the broad groups: living things → plants and animals → further subdivisions. For animals, distinguish vertebrates (fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals) from invertebrates (insects, spiders, worms, snails, etc.). For plants, distinguish flowering from non-flowering plants (ferns, mosses, conifers). Introduce micro-organisms as a third major group alongside plants and animals. Use specimen collections or high-quality photographs to practise classification. Create classification posters showing the hierarchy with examples at each level.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think invertebrates are less important or less complex than vertebrates — invertebrates actually make up about 97% of all animal species. Some pupils classify organisms by habitat rather than biological features (putting dolphins with fish because they live in water). Children may not recognise that fungi are a separate group, not plants — fungi do not photosynthesise. Some pupils think classification is about personal preference rather than observable shared characteristics.

**Key vocabulary:** classification, Linnaeus, vertebrate, invertebrate, fish, amphibian, reptile, bird, mammal, insect, flowering plant, non-flowering plant, micro-organism, kingdom, group, characteristic, hierarchy

#### SC-KS2-C059 — Micro-organisms
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Introduction to micro-organisms as a broad group of living things too small to see with the naked eye. Included in the formal classification of living things. Not yet expected to classify into bacteria, fungi, viruses etc. at this stage.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce micro-organisms through practical examples: grow bread mould, observe yeast producing bubbles when mixed with warm water and sugar, discuss bacteria in yoghurt-making. Use microscope images or videos to show the diversity of micro-organisms. Discuss both helpful micro-organisms (yeast for bread, bacteria for decomposition, gut bacteria for digestion) and harmful ones (bacteria causing food poisoning, viruses causing illness). Link to hygiene — handwashing, food safety. Emphasise that micro-organisms are living things that are too small to see without a microscope. At this stage, pupils need not classify them into bacteria, viruses and fungi.

**Common misconceptions:** Children commonly believe that all micro-organisms are harmful 'germs', when many are essential for life — decomposition, digestion, food production. Some pupils think micro-organisms are not really alive because they cannot be seen. Children may confuse bacteria and viruses, thinking they are the same thing and can be treated the same way (antibiotics work against bacteria but not viruses). Some pupils think micro-organisms only exist in 'dirty' places.

**Key vocabulary:** micro-organism, microbe, bacteria, virus, fungi, yeast, mould, microscope, tiny, invisible, decompose, disease, hygiene, helpful, harmful, living

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS2-D007-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Sorting, classifying and identifying similarities directly trains pupils to recognise regularities and use them to predict or generalise.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Evidence and Argument**: What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Drawing conclusions from observations requires constructing a claim supported by specific evidence — not just describing what was seen.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'

**SC-KS2-D007-CL002:**
- **Cause and Effect** (primary): What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Fair testing and investigations are designed to isolate variables and establish causal relationships — the cognitive demand is reasoning from controlled evidence to causal claims.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Data from repeated investigations reveals patterns that allow pupils to generalise their findings beyond the specific test conditions.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next.

  Why: Data from repeated investigations reveals patterns that allow pupils to generalise their findings beyond the specific test conditions.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**SC-KS2-D007-CL004:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Food chains, food webs and ecosystems are system models: pupils map components (producers, consumers, decomposers), trace energy flows, and predict what happens when one part changes.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Stability and Change**: What keeps this stable, what causes change, and how quickly does change happen?
  Why: Ecosystems maintain dynamic equilibria that can be disrupted by changes to one component — exploring what keeps the system stable and what destabilises it is an equally powerful framing.
  AI instruction: Use the STABILITY AND CHANGE lens: prompt pupils to identify what conditions keep a system in balance, what disrupts equilibrium, and how change can be gradual or sudden. Useful questions: 'What keeps this the same?', 'What would tip it into change?', 'Is the change reversible?', 'How fast is this changing, and why?'

## Domain: SC-KS2-D008 — States of Matter
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
States of Matter at KS2 introduces pupils to the particle model as the scientific explanation for the properties and behaviour of solids, liquids and gases. Pupils compare and group materials together according to whether they are solid, liquid or gas at room temperature, and investigate the processes of evaporation and condensation in the context of the water cycle. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to observe that some materials change state when they are heated or cooled, and to measure or research the temperature at which this happens. This provides the conceptual foundation for understanding thermodynamics, chemical reactions and the physical geography of the water cycle at later stages.

### Concepts (3)

#### SC-KS2-C034 — Three States of Matter
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding that materials can be classified as solids, liquids or gases based on their observable properties. Solids hold their shape; liquids form a pool but not a pile; gases escape from unsealed containers and are not visible.

**Teaching guidance:** Sort a collection of materials into solids, liquids and gases based on observable properties. Investigate borderline cases — is sand a solid or a liquid? (Solid, because each grain is solid even though sand pours.) Is toothpaste a solid or a liquid? Introduce the particle model informally: in solids, particles are closely packed and vibrate in fixed positions; in liquids, particles are close but can move around each other; in gases, particles are far apart and move freely. Use physical modelling (pupils acting as particles) to represent each state. Explore gases by trapping air in syringes and balloons.

**Common misconceptions:** Children commonly think that powders (flour, sand, sugar) are liquids because they pour. They are collections of tiny solids. Some pupils think gases have no mass or do not exist because they are invisible — weighing a balloon before and after inflation can address this. Children may struggle with the concept that the same substance (e.g., water) can exist as a solid, liquid or gas depending on temperature.

**Key vocabulary:** solid, liquid, gas, state of matter, property, shape, volume, flow, pour, compress, particle, fixed, vibrate, container, material, classify

#### SC-KS2-C035 — Changes of State
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding that materials change state when heated or cooled: melting (solid to liquid), freezing (liquid to solid), evaporation/boiling (liquid to gas), condensation (gas to liquid). Temperature at which state changes occur can be measured in degrees Celsius.

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate changes of state practically: melt ice and chocolate, freeze water and fruit juice, observe evaporation from wet surfaces, and collect condensation on a cold mirror held above steam. Measure temperatures at which changes occur using thermometers. Create a diagram showing the cycle of changes: solid ⇌ liquid ⇌ gas, with heating arrows in one direction and cooling arrows in the other. Use the terms melting, freezing, evaporating, boiling and condensing precisely. Investigate factors that affect evaporation rate (temperature, surface area, air movement) through fair test investigations.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often confuse evaporation with boiling — evaporation occurs at any temperature from the surface of a liquid, while boiling occurs throughout the liquid at a specific temperature. Some pupils think that when water evaporates it disappears or ceases to exist, rather than becoming invisible water vapour in the air. Children may believe that melting and dissolving are the same process — melting is a change of state caused by heat, while dissolving is a solid mixing into a liquid.

**Key vocabulary:** melting, freezing, evaporation, boiling, condensation, solid, liquid, gas, change of state, temperature, degrees Celsius, thermometer, heat, cool, reversible, boiling point, melting point

#### SC-KS2-C036 — The Water Cycle
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding that evaporation and condensation are key processes in the water cycle. Water evaporates from oceans, lakes and land when heated; water vapour condenses to form clouds; precipitation returns water to the surface. Rate of evaporation increases with temperature.

**Teaching guidance:** Create a physical model of the water cycle using a sealed container with warm water, ice placed on top, and a heat source. Observe evaporation, condensation on the cool surface, and 'precipitation' dripping back down. Label each stage of the cycle and connect to the scientific terms learned in states of matter. Discuss where water evaporates from in nature (oceans, lakes, rivers, soil, plants) and what causes condensation (cooling of water vapour as it rises in the atmosphere). Link to geography — rivers, rainfall patterns, clouds. Investigate how temperature affects evaporation rate.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think clouds are made of water vapour — clouds are actually made of tiny liquid water droplets or ice crystals; water vapour is invisible. Some pupils believe rain falls from clouds when they 'get too heavy' or 'burst', rather than understanding the role of further condensation and coalescence. Children may think the water cycle is a one-way process (evaporation → rain) rather than a continuous cycle with water endlessly recycling.

**Key vocabulary:** water cycle, evaporation, condensation, precipitation, cloud, water vapour, temperature, heat, ocean, river, lake, rain, atmosphere, cycle, sun, energy

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS2-D008-CL001:**
- **Evidence and Argument** (primary): What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: This cluster asks pupils to gather, record or communicate scientific findings — the core cognitive demand is evaluating what counts as valid evidence and how to present it clearly.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Scientific observations and enquiry serve to establish causal relationships; framing questions around 'what causes X' gives purpose to the observation work.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

**SC-KS2-D008-CL002:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Material properties link physical structure (molecular arrangement, surface texture) to functional behaviour (waterproofing, strength, flexibility) — the key question is always 'why does this material behave this way?'
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Properties can be sorted and classified into patterns (metals conduct, insulators don't), allowing pupils to make predictions about unfamiliar materials.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

### Objectives (3)
- SC-KS2-O042 [statutory]: compare and group materials together, according to whether they are solids, liquids or gases

## Domain: SC-KS2-D009 — Sound
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
The Sound domain requires pupils to understand sound as a physical phenomenon produced by vibration, and to explore the properties of sound — pitch, volume and the materials through which sound travels. Pupils identify how sounds are made (all sounds result from something vibrating), and understand that vibrations travel through a medium to the ear. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to investigate the relationship between the vibration of a string and the pitch of the sound produced, and to understand how sound is attenuated by distance. Pupils develop the ability to design fair test investigations, measuring and recording sound levels and making predictions about variables that affect pitch and volume.

### Concepts (4)

#### SC-KS2-C037 — Vibration as the Cause of Sound **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 4 | Fan-out: 3

Understanding that all sounds are made by vibrating objects. The vibration causes surrounding particles to vibrate, transmitting the sound as a wave through the medium (solid, liquid or gas) to the ear.

**Teaching guidance:** Explore sound production through hands-on activities: pluck a guitar string and watch it vibrate, strike a tuning fork and touch it to water to see splashing, tap a drum with rice grains on top to see them bounce, and hold a ruler over the edge of a desk and twang it. Use the common thread to establish the principle that all sounds come from something vibrating. Place a hand on the throat while humming to feel vocal cord vibration. Discuss how to stop a sound — stop the vibration (damping). Use the term 'vibration' consistently and ask pupils to identify what is vibrating in each example.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think sounds just 'happen' without anything vibrating, or that only musical instruments vibrate. They may not connect everyday sounds (speech, traffic, wind) to vibration. Some pupils think that when they hear a sound, the vibrating object has sent something physical to their ear rather than understanding that vibrations pass through the air as a wave.

**Key vocabulary:** sound, vibration, vibrate, source, wave, ear, hear, loud, quiet, pitch, tuning fork, instrument, drum, string, vocal cords, energy

#### SC-KS2-C038 — Sound Transmission Through Media
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding that vibrations from sounds travel through a medium (solid, liquid or gas) to the ear. Sound cannot travel through a vacuum. Sound travels through different media at different speeds.

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate sound travelling through different media: use a 'string telephone' to demonstrate sound travelling through a taut string (solid); listen to sounds underwater in a large container (liquid); compare sounds heard through air (gas). Press an ear to a desk while a partner taps the other end to hear sound travelling through a solid. Discuss why astronauts cannot hear each other in space — sound needs a medium and space is a vacuum. Compare how well sound travels through solids, liquids and gases. Use a bell in a vacuum jar demonstration (video if equipment unavailable) to show that sound cannot travel without a medium.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often believe sound can travel through a vacuum (influenced by science fiction films showing explosions in space). Some pupils think sound travels only through air and are surprised it can travel through solids and liquids. Children may believe sound travels at the same speed through all materials — it actually travels faster through solids than liquids, and faster through liquids than gases.

**Key vocabulary:** sound, vibration, travel, medium, solid, liquid, gas, vacuum, ear, wave, transmit, air, speed, distance, string telephone, particle

#### SC-KS2-C039 — Pitch and Sound Source Features
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding that the pitch of a sound is related to features of the object producing it. Longer, larger or looser objects produce lower pitch sounds. Shorter, smaller or tighter objects produce higher pitch sounds. Patterns can be found and investigated.

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate pitch using musical instruments: pluck guitar strings of different thickness and tension, blow across bottles filled to different levels, and use chime bars of different lengths. Identify the pattern: shorter, thinner and tighter objects produce higher-pitched sounds. Make a simple instrument (e.g., an elastic band guitar on a shoebox) and systematically change one variable at a time to observe its effect on pitch. Use tuning forks of different sizes to demonstrate the relationship between size and pitch. Connect to music curriculum — high and low notes on a keyboard or recorder.

**Common misconceptions:** Children commonly confuse pitch with volume — they may describe a high-pitched sound as 'loud' and a low-pitched sound as 'quiet'. Pitch and volume are independent properties. Some pupils think that only the length of an object affects pitch, not recognising that thickness and tension also play a role. Children may believe that bigger instruments always make lower sounds, which is generally true but not always (a piccolo is smaller than a flute but plays higher).

**Key vocabulary:** pitch, high, low, vibration, frequency, length, thickness, tension, tight, loose, long, short, thick, thin, instrument, note, tuning fork, pattern

#### SC-KS2-C040 — Volume and Vibration Strength
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding that the volume (loudness) of a sound is related to the strength (amplitude) of the vibrations producing it. Stronger vibrations produce louder sounds. Sound becomes fainter as distance from the source increases.

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate volume by striking a drum with different amounts of force and observing the effect. Use a tuning fork: strike it gently and then firmly, observing larger vibrations producing louder sounds. Place rice grains on a drum skin and observe them bouncing higher with louder hits. Investigate how sound becomes fainter with distance — have one pupil clap while others stand at increasing distances and describe the volume. Discuss everyday applications: why we shout to be heard across a playground, why walls muffle sound, why ear defenders work. Use decibel meters or apps to measure sound levels.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often confuse volume (loudness) with pitch (high or low). They are independent — a sound can be loud and high, loud and low, quiet and high, or quiet and low. Some pupils think that louder sounds travel faster than quieter sounds — volume and speed of sound are unrelated. Children may not understand why sound gets fainter with distance, thinking the sound 'runs out' rather than understanding that sound energy spreads out over a larger area.

**Key vocabulary:** volume, loud, quiet, faint, vibration, amplitude, strength, force, distance, energy, decibel, sound level, ear, hear, muffle, absorb

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS2-D009-CL001:**
- **Cause and Effect** (primary): What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Fair testing and investigations are designed to isolate variables and establish causal relationships — the cognitive demand is reasoning from controlled evidence to causal claims.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes.

#### SC-KS2-CV004 — Sound Investigation (investigation)
Pattern-seeking enquiry into how sounds are made and how pitch and volume can be changed. Pupils explore vibrations using tuning forks, rulers, and elastic bands.
Delivers: SC-KS2-C037, SC-KS2-C038, SC-KS2-C039, SC-KS2-C040
Enquiry type: pattern_seeking
Equipment: tuning forks, water tray, rulers, elastic bands, shoe boxes (string telephones), rice on drum skin

## Domain: SC-KS2-D010 — Electricity
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Electricity at KS2 introduces pupils to electric circuits as systems in which energy is transferred from a power source through components. Pupils construct simple series circuits and investigate the effects of adding or removing components, predicting whether a lamp will light based on whether the circuit is complete. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to understand the function of common circuit components — cells, wires, bulbs, switches and buzzers — and to use recognised circuit symbols to draw diagrams. By upper KS2, pupils investigate how circuit properties (voltage, number of cells, component type) affect the behaviour of the circuit, developing the quantitative understanding of electricity that is extended at KS3.

### Concepts (4)

#### SC-KS2-C041 — Series Electrical Circuits
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding that a simple series electrical circuit consists of components (cells, bulbs, switches, buzzers, wires) connected in a single unbroken loop. A lamp will only light when part of a complete circuit. In Year 6, circuits can be represented using standard symbols.

**Teaching guidance:** Provide circuit-building kits (cells, wires, bulbs, switches, buzzers, motors) and challenge pupils to make a bulb light up. Investigate what happens when the circuit is broken — the bulb goes out, demonstrating the need for a complete loop. Add switches and discuss their function as deliberate circuit breakers. In Year 4, use pictorial representations of circuits. In Year 6, introduce standard circuit symbols and teach pupils to draw and interpret circuit diagrams. Investigate what happens when more bulbs or more cells are added to a series circuit.

**Common misconceptions:** The most persistent misconception is that electricity 'flows out of' the battery into the bulb and is 'used up'. In fact, current flows in a complete loop and is not consumed — energy is transferred, not the charge itself. Some pupils think electricity flows from both ends of the battery and meets in the bulb ('clashing currents' model). Children may believe that the order of components in a series circuit matters — it does not for a simple series circuit.

**Key vocabulary:** circuit, series, cell, battery, wire, bulb, switch, buzzer, motor, loop, complete, break, component, electrical, current, flow, symbol, diagram

#### SC-KS2-C042 — Conductors and Insulators
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that some materials allow electricity to flow through them (conductors) while others do not (insulators). Metals tend to be good conductors. Insulators are used to protect us from electrical current and to prevent short circuits.

**Teaching guidance:** Build a test circuit with a gap and challenge pupils to test a variety of materials by placing them in the gap to see if the bulb lights. Test metals (copper, iron, aluminium, steel), non-metals (wood, plastic, rubber, glass, paper), and liquids (water, salt water). Record results in a table and look for patterns — metals generally conduct, non-metals generally do not. Discuss why electrical wires have metal cores (conductor) wrapped in plastic (insulator). Link to safety: insulators protect us from electric shocks; never touch bare wires or damaged cables.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think all metals are conductors and all non-metals are insulators. While this is broadly true, graphite (a non-metal) conducts electricity, and some metal oxides are poor conductors. Some pupils confuse electrical conductors with thermal conductors — a material can be good at conducting one but not the other. Children may think that water always conducts electricity — pure water is a poor conductor, but dissolved salts (as in tap water) make it conductive.

**Key vocabulary:** conductor, insulator, conduct, electricity, metal, non-metal, material, test, circuit, bulb, flow, current, copper, plastic, rubber, safety, protection

#### SC-KS2-C043 — Voltage and Circuit Effects
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding that the brightness of a lamp and the volume of a buzzer are associated with the number and voltage of cells in a circuit. More cells/higher voltage produces brighter bulbs and louder buzzers. Voltage is introduced informally.

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate the effect of adding more cells to a series circuit: with one cell the bulb is dim, with two cells it is brighter, with three cells it is very bright (and may blow). Use this to introduce the idea that more cells provide more 'push' (voltage) to the current. Compare circuits with different numbers of cells systematically, measuring brightness using a light sensor or ranking by observation. Discuss why we use different numbers of batteries in different devices (a torch needs fewer than a laptop). Introduce the volt as the unit of voltage. Predict and test what happens when cells are reversed.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often confuse voltage with current, thinking they are the same thing. Voltage is the 'push' or energy given to the current; current is the flow of charge. Some pupils think that adding more bulbs to a series circuit makes them all brighter (it actually makes them dimmer because the voltage is shared). Children may not understand why batteries go flat — the chemical energy is gradually converted to other forms.

**Key vocabulary:** voltage, volt, cell, battery, brightness, circuit, component, bulb, buzzer, current, push, energy, series, increase, decrease, effect, power

#### SC-KS2-C068 — Circuit Symbols and Diagrams
Type: skill | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 4 | Fan-out: 1

Using recognised standard symbols to represent components in circuit diagrams: cell, battery, bulb, switch, buzzer, wire. Ability to draw and interpret circuit diagrams using standard symbols, building on pictorial representations from Year 4.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach the standard circuit symbols systematically: cell (long and short parallel lines), battery (multiple cells), bulb (circle with cross), switch (break in line), buzzer (semicircle), wire (straight line), motor (circle with M). Provide printed symbol reference cards. Practise converting pictorial circuit drawings into standard symbol diagrams and vice versa. Build circuits from diagrams and draw diagrams from built circuits. Emphasise the advantages of standard symbols — they are understood internationally and remove ambiguity. Use circuit diagram puzzles where pupils predict whether a circuit will work based on the diagram. Link to Y4 practical circuit-building skills.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often confuse the symbols for a cell and a battery — a single cell has one long and one short line; a battery (multiple cells) has several pairs. Some pupils draw circuit diagrams with gaps or components floating rather than connected in a complete loop. Children may think the diagram represents the physical layout of the circuit rather than understanding it as a schematic representation — components do not need to be in the same spatial positions as in the real circuit.

**Key vocabulary:** circuit diagram, symbol, cell, battery, bulb, switch, buzzer, motor, wire, component, series, standard, represent, draw, interpret, connect, international

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS2-D010-CL001:**
- **Cause and Effect** (primary): What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Fair testing and investigations are designed to isolate variables and establish causal relationships — the cognitive demand is reasoning from controlled evidence to causal claims.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Data from repeated investigations reveals patterns that allow pupils to generalise their findings beyond the specific test conditions.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**SC-KS2-D010-CL002:**
- **Evidence and Argument** (primary): What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: This cluster asks pupils to gather, record or communicate scientific findings — the core cognitive demand is evaluating what counts as valid evidence and how to present it clearly.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Scientific observations and enquiry serve to establish causal relationships; framing questions around 'what causes X' gives purpose to the observation work.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

## Domain: SC-KS2-D011 — Properties and Changes of Materials
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Properties and Changes of Materials at upper KS2 requires pupils to compare and group materials based on physical properties — hardness, solubility, thermal conductivity, response to magnets, transparency — and to investigate mixtures and methods of separating them. Pupils understand that some changes (dissolving, mixing, changes of state) are reversible while others (burning, rusting, reactions involving new substances) are not, and learn to describe the differences using appropriate scientific language. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to investigate whether dissolving, mixing and changes of state produce new materials, providing the foundation for understanding chemical change at KS3.

### Concepts (5)

#### SC-KS2-C047 — Extended Material Properties
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5 | Fan-out: 1

Comparing and grouping materials based on a wider range of properties: hardness, solubility, transparency, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and response to magnets. Builds on KS1 and Y4 materials knowledge with additional property types.

**Teaching guidance:** Set up a systematic investigation of material properties using a range of tests: scratch test for hardness (compare wood, metal, plastic, stone), dissolving test for solubility (test sugar, sand, salt, chalk in water), transparency test (classify as transparent, translucent or opaque), thermal conductivity test (wrap identical cups of hot water in different materials and measure cooling rate), electrical conductivity test (insert into a circuit gap), and magnet test. Record results in a property comparison table. Discuss how property knowledge helps engineers and designers choose the right material for each purpose.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often confuse thermal conductivity with temperature — a metal spoon feels cold not because it is colder than a wooden spoon but because it conducts heat away from your hand faster. Some pupils think that if a material dissolves it has disappeared or been destroyed, rather than understanding it has dispersed into the liquid. Children may believe that hardness and strength are the same thing — glass is hard but brittle, while rubber is soft but strong.

**Key vocabulary:** property, hardness, solubility, transparency, conductivity, thermal, electrical, magnetic, opaque, translucent, transparent, dissolve, soluble, insoluble, compare, group, material, purpose

#### SC-KS2-C048 — Dissolving and Solutions
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding that some materials dissolve in liquid to form a solution — the solute appears to disappear but is not lost. Understanding that a dissolved substance can be recovered by evaporating the solvent. Dissolving is different from melting.

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate dissolving by adding salt, sugar, sand and chalk to water, stirring and observing. Weigh the water before and after dissolving salt to show the mass has increased — the salt is still there even though invisible. Investigate factors that affect dissolving rate: temperature, stirring, grain size. Recover a dissolved substance by evaporating the water — leave a saucer of salt solution on a warm windowsill and observe salt crystals forming. Explicitly distinguish dissolving from melting: dissolving requires a solvent (liquid), melting requires heat. Use the terms solute, solvent and solution consistently.

**Common misconceptions:** The most common misconception is confusing dissolving with melting. Dissolving requires a liquid (solvent); melting requires heat to change a solid to a liquid. Sugar dissolves in water; ice melts in warm air. Children often think that when something dissolves it has gone forever or been destroyed — weighing before and after proves the dissolved substance is still present. Some pupils think stirring makes more solid dissolve rather than simply speeding up the process.

**Key vocabulary:** dissolve, solution, solute, solvent, soluble, insoluble, filter, evaporate, recover, crystal, stir, temperature, rate, mass, disappear, transparent, mixture

#### SC-KS2-C049 — Separating Mixtures
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding that mixtures of solids, liquids and gases can be separated using various techniques: filtering (remove insoluble solids from liquids), sieving (separate solids by particle size), evaporating (recover dissolved solids). Technique chosen depends on properties of components.

**Teaching guidance:** Demonstrate each separation technique practically: use sieving to separate rice from flour; filtering to separate sand from water (using filter paper and funnel); evaporating to recover salt from salt water (using an evaporating dish over a water bath). Discuss which technique is appropriate for which mixture and why — sieving separates by particle size, filtering separates insoluble solids from liquids, evaporation separates dissolved solids from liquids. Challenge pupils with mystery mixtures to separate (e.g., salt, sand and iron filings — use magnet, then dissolve salt in water and filter, then evaporate). Link separation techniques to real-world applications: water purification, mining, recycling.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think that filtering can separate dissolved substances from water — it cannot; only evaporation or distillation works for solutions. Some pupils confuse sieving with filtering, not recognising the difference in particle size involved. Children may believe that once mixed, substances can never be separated, rather than understanding that different properties allow different separation methods.

**Key vocabulary:** separate, mixture, filter, sieve, evaporate, dissolve, insoluble, soluble, technique, method, filter paper, funnel, residue, filtrate, solution, particle, purify

#### SC-KS2-C050 — Reversible Changes
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that some material changes are reversible — the original materials can be recovered. Examples: dissolving, mixing, melting, freezing, evaporation, condensation. The material is changed in form but not in substance.

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate a range of reversible changes: melt chocolate and let it re-solidify; dissolve salt and evaporate to recover it; freeze water and melt the ice. Create a concept map linking all reversible changes, emphasising that the original materials can always be recovered and no new substance is formed. Compare each reversible change with an equivalent irreversible change — melting chocolate (reversible) versus burning toast (irreversible). Use the criterion 'Can we get the original material back?' as the key test. Discuss everyday examples: drying wet clothes (reversible evaporation of water), recycling metals by melting and reshaping.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think that all changes caused by heating are irreversible, not recognising that melting and evaporation are reversible. Some pupils believe dissolving is irreversible because they cannot see the solid, when in fact evaporation will recover it. Children may confuse reversible changes with the idea of 'undoing' something — reversibility means the original materials can be recovered, not that the exact same object is restored.

**Key vocabulary:** reversible, change, recover, original, material, melt, freeze, dissolve, evaporate, condense, mix, separate, substance, form, physical change, state

#### SC-KS2-C051 — Irreversible Changes
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding that some changes result in the formation of new materials and are not easily reversed. Examples: burning, rusting, acid reacting with bicarbonate of soda, cooking. New substances are formed that cannot easily be changed back.

**Teaching guidance:** Demonstrate irreversible changes safely: burn a piece of paper or candle (adult-supervised), mix vinegar with bicarbonate of soda to observe gas production, cook an egg, and observe rusting of iron wool in damp conditions over several days. In each case, discuss what evidence shows a new substance has formed — change in colour, production of gas, change in temperature, production of light or smoke. Contrast with reversible changes done in parallel: melt ice alongside burning a candle. Emphasise that irreversible changes produce new materials with different properties. Introduce the term 'chemical change' informally.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often struggle to distinguish irreversible from reversible changes. A useful test is: 'Has a new substance been formed with different properties?' Cooking an egg is irreversible — you cannot uncook it because the proteins have permanently changed. Some pupils think burning makes things disappear rather than producing new substances (ash, gases, smoke). Children may not recognise rusting as a chemical change because it happens slowly.

**Key vocabulary:** irreversible, chemical change, new substance, burn, rust, react, gas, temperature change, permanent, original, material, evidence, property, formation, combustion

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS2-D011-CL001:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Material properties link physical structure (molecular arrangement, surface texture) to functional behaviour (waterproofing, strength, flexibility) — the key question is always 'why does this material behave this way?'
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Properties can be sorted and classified into patterns (metals conduct, insulators don't), allowing pupils to make predictions about unfamiliar materials.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**SC-KS2-D011-CL002:**

## Domain: SC-KS2-D012 — Earth and Space
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Earth and Space at upper KS2 provides pupils with an understanding of the solar system, Earth's movements and the phenomena associated with them — day and night, seasons, phases of the Moon. Pupils learn that the Earth, along with other planets, orbits the Sun, and that the Moon orbits the Earth, using models and research to understand the relative sizes, distances and movements of these bodies. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to explain day and night as the result of Earth rotating on its axis, and to understand how this differs from the annual orbit of the Earth around the Sun. This provides important foundations for astronomical and geographical concepts at KS3 and beyond.

### Concepts (3)

#### SC-KS2-C052 — The Solar System
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that the Sun is a star at the centre of our solar system and that eight planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) orbit it. Heliocentric model replaced earlier geocentric model. History of scientific ideas including Ptolemy, Alhazen, Copernicus.

**Teaching guidance:** Create a scale model of the solar system using appropriately scaled spheres (or fruits) to show relative sizes, and use the school field or corridor to show relative distances (even scaled down, the distances are striking). Teach the order of the eight planets using a mnemonic (e.g., 'My Very Enthusiastic Mother Just Served Us Nachos'). Discuss the heliocentric model and its history — how Copernicus, Galileo and others challenged the geocentric model with evidence from observations. Use videos or planetarium software to visualise planetary orbits. Emphasise that the Sun is a star and that planets orbit it due to gravity.

**Common misconceptions:** Children commonly believe that the Sun orbits the Earth (geocentric model) because that matches everyday observation of the Sun 'moving' across the sky. Pupils often dramatically underestimate the distances between planets and overestimate the relative size of Earth compared to Jupiter or Saturn. Some children think stars and planets are the same thing — stars produce light, planets reflect it. Children may believe Pluto is still classified as a planet.

**Key vocabulary:** solar system, Sun, star, planet, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, orbit, heliocentric, geocentric, satellite, gravity, astronomer, Copernicus

#### SC-KS2-C053 — Earth's Rotation and Day/Night
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding that the Earth rotates on its axis once every 24 hours, causing day and night. The part of Earth facing the Sun experiences day; the opposite side experiences night. The Sun's apparent movement across the sky is explained by Earth's rotation, not the Sun moving.

**Teaching guidance:** Use a globe and a torch in a darkened room to model Earth's rotation and day/night. Mark the pupils' location on the globe and slowly rotate it to show how their location moves from day (facing the torch) to night (facing away). Emphasise that it is Earth rotating, not the Sun moving around Earth. Discuss time zones as evidence of Earth's rotation. Use the model to explain why the Sun appears to move across the sky during the day — we are rotating beneath a stationary Sun. Link to KS1 work on seasonal day length changes. Use slow-motion videos of sunrises and sunsets to reinforce that these are caused by Earth's rotation.

**Common misconceptions:** The most persistent misconception is that day and night are caused by the Sun going around the Earth. Some children think night occurs because the Moon or clouds block the Sun. Pupils may confuse Earth's daily rotation (causing day/night) with its yearly orbit around the Sun (causing seasons). Some children think that different countries have day and night at different times because the Sun travels to different places, rather than because Earth rotates.

**Key vocabulary:** Earth, rotate, rotation, axis, spin, day, night, Sun, globe, orbit, shadow, time zone, sunrise, sunset, 24 hours, apparent movement

#### SC-KS2-C054 — Moon's Orbit
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding that the Moon is a natural satellite that orbits the Earth. The Moon is approximately spherical. Other planets also have moons. The Moon's orbital relationship with Earth distinguishes it from planets.

**Teaching guidance:** Use a model with a torch (Sun), a large ball (Earth) and a small ball (Moon) to demonstrate the Moon orbiting Earth while Earth orbits the Sun. Observe the Moon over a month and record its appearance — noting the phases from new moon through crescent, quarter, gibbous to full moon and back. Discuss why the Moon appears to change shape (different portions illuminated as it orbits). Compare the Moon with planets — the Moon is a natural satellite, not a planet. Research other moons in the solar system (Jupiter's Galilean moons, Saturn's Titan). Emphasise that the Moon is approximately spherical.

**Common misconceptions:** Children commonly believe the Moon produces its own light — it reflects sunlight. Some pupils think the Moon's phases are caused by Earth's shadow falling on the Moon (that is a lunar eclipse, which is rare). Children may believe the Moon is only visible at night, when in fact it is often visible during the day. Some pupils think the Moon does not rotate, but it does — once per orbit, which is why we always see the same face.

**Key vocabulary:** Moon, orbit, satellite, natural satellite, Earth, phase, full moon, new moon, crescent, sphere, spherical, reflect, illuminate, rotate, month, lunar

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS2-D012-CL001:**
- **Cause and Effect** (primary): What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Fair testing and investigations are designed to isolate variables and establish causal relationships — the cognitive demand is reasoning from controlled evidence to causal claims.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

## Domain: SC-KS2-D013 — Forces
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Forces at upper KS2 moves beyond the qualitative introduction of Year 3 to a more quantitative understanding, including gravity, air resistance, water resistance and mechanisms that can change the effect of forces. Pupils investigate how objects fall due to gravity and explore the effects of air resistance and water resistance in opposing motion. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to understand that some mechanisms — levers, pulleys and gears — allow a smaller force to have a greater effect, introducing the concept of mechanical advantage. Pupils design and evaluate fair tests investigating factors that affect the force of air resistance or water resistance, developing their scientific investigation skills.

### Concepts (3)

#### SC-KS2-C055 — Gravity
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding that gravity is a non-contact force of attraction acting between the Earth and objects. Unsupported objects fall towards Earth because of gravity. Gravity is responsible for keeping planets in orbit around the Sun and the Moon in orbit around Earth.

**Teaching guidance:** Drop a range of objects (feather, ball, piece of paper, stone) and observe that unsupported objects fall due to gravity. Discuss why a feather falls more slowly than a ball — air resistance, not less gravity. Use the term 'gravitational force' or 'gravitational pull' and explain it as an attractive force between the Earth and all objects. Demonstrate that gravity acts on all objects regardless of mass by dropping two objects of different mass but similar shape from the same height. Discuss gravity's role in keeping planets orbiting the Sun and the Moon orbiting Earth. Connect to the concept of weight as a measure of gravitational force.

**Common misconceptions:** Children commonly believe heavier objects fall faster than lighter ones. In a vacuum they fall at the same rate — in air, differences are caused by air resistance, not gravity. Some pupils think gravity only exists on Earth or only works at the Earth's surface. Children may confuse mass and weight — mass is the amount of matter (measured in kg), weight is the gravitational force acting on that mass (measured in Newtons). Some pupils think there is no gravity in space.

**Key vocabulary:** gravity, gravitational force, attract, pull, weight, mass, fall, unsupported, orbit, Earth, Sun, Moon, Newton, force, non-contact, downward

#### SC-KS2-C056 — Resistance Forces
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding that air resistance, water resistance and friction are forces that act against motion between moving surfaces. These forces slow objects down and can be useful (parachutes, brakes) or a problem (inefficiency). Friction acts between surfaces in contact.

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate air resistance by dropping paper shapes of different sizes and observing fall rates. Design and test parachutes of different sizes and materials, measuring the time they take to fall a fixed distance. Investigate water resistance by pulling different shapes through water and comparing the force required. Compare friction on different surfaces using a force meter to pull a shoe across carpet, wood, tile and sandpaper. Discuss the design features of real objects that minimise resistance (streamlined cars, cyclists' clothing) or maximise it (parachutes, brake pads, non-slip shoes). Link to fair testing — changing one variable at a time.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think that moving objects have a force pushing them forward even after the push has stopped. Once no force acts, the object slows due to friction and air resistance. Some pupils believe friction only acts when objects are moving — static friction also acts to prevent objects from starting to move. Children may think that air resistance only affects large objects like parachutes, not recognising it acts on all moving objects.

**Key vocabulary:** air resistance, water resistance, friction, streamlined, drag, force, surface, parachute, shape, area, speed, slow down, oppose, motion, force meter, Newton

#### SC-KS2-C057 — Mechanisms as Force Multipliers
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding that simple mechanisms — levers, pulleys and gears — allow a smaller input force to have a greater effect. These machines do not create energy but redistribute force and distance. Applications in everyday tools and machines.

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate levers by using a ruler balanced on a pencil to lift objects — explore how moving the fulcrum changes the effort needed. Explore pulleys using a simple pulley system to lift a weight — compare the force needed with and without the pulley. Examine gears using construction kits (LEGO Technic, K'Nex) to see how different-sized gears change speed and force. Identify mechanisms in everyday objects: scissors (lever), bicycle gears, fishing rod (lever), flagpole (pulley), clock mechanism (gears). Emphasise that these mechanisms do not create energy — they trade force for distance. A small force over a large distance can move a large load a small distance.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think that machines create energy or force from nothing — they actually redistribute force and distance. A lever does not reduce the total work done; it allows a smaller force to be applied over a larger distance. Some pupils think pulleys only change the direction of force, not recognising that pulley systems with multiple wheels also provide mechanical advantage. Children may not recognise everyday objects (scissors, wheelbarrows, bottle openers) as levers.

**Key vocabulary:** mechanism, lever, pulley, gear, fulcrum, pivot, effort, load, force, distance, mechanical advantage, machine, simple machine, input, output, energy, transfer

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS2-D013-CL001:**
- **Energy and Matter** (primary): Where does the energy come from, where does it go, and is anything conserved?
  Why: Energy clusters require pupils to trace where energy comes from, how it is transferred or transformed, and where it ends up — conservation and flow are the central ideas.
  AI instruction: Use the ENERGY AND MATTER lens: prompt pupils to trace energy pathways, identify transformations between energy forms, track matter through cycles, and apply conservation thinking. Useful questions: 'Where did the energy come from?', 'What happened to it?', 'Is anything created or destroyed?', 'Can you draw the energy flow?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Physical phenomena (shadows, circuits, forces) involve clear causal chains: changing one variable produces a predictable effect, making cause-and-effect reasoning the investigative frame.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

**SC-KS2-D013-CL002:**

## Domain: SC-KS2-D014 — Evolution and Inheritance
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Evolution and Inheritance at upper KS2 introduces pupils to Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection as the scientific explanation for the diversity of life on Earth. Pupils learn that living things have changed over millions of years and that fossils provide evidence of organisms that lived long ago, connecting this to the geological evidence studied in the Rocks domain. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to understand that offspring are not identical to their parents (variation), that some variations are advantageous in a particular environment (natural selection), and that this can lead to evolution over many generations. This domain provides the conceptual framework for understanding inheritance, genetics and biodiversity at KS3.

### Concepts (4)

#### SC-KS2-C063 — Fossils as Evidence of Change Over Time
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that fossils (introduced in Y3 as trapped remains in rock) provide evidence that living things have changed over time and that animals and plants that no longer exist once lived on Earth millions of years ago.

**Teaching guidance:** Revisit fossil knowledge from Year 3 and extend it to the concept of change over time. Compare fossils of extinct organisms with their closest living relatives — for example, ammonites with modern nautilus, trilobites with modern woodlice. Use a geological timeline to show when major groups appeared and disappeared. Discuss what fossils tell us: the types of organisms that existed, the environments they lived in, and how life has changed over millions of years. Link to Darwin's use of fossil evidence in developing his theory of evolution. Examine the concept of extinction — why species disappear and what causes it.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think dinosaurs and humans lived at the same time. Dinosaurs became extinct approximately 66 million years ago; modern humans appeared around 300,000 years ago. Some pupils believe that fossils are only of dinosaurs, not recognising the vast range of fossilised organisms (plants, shells, fish, insects). Children may think that if a species goes extinct, it was somehow 'inferior', rather than understanding that extinction results from environmental change exceeding a species' ability to adapt.

**Key vocabulary:** fossil, evidence, extinct, change, time, millions of years, species, organism, geological, ancient, remains, compare, ancestor, descendant, evolution, palaeontology

#### SC-KS2-C064 — Variation in Offspring
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that living things reproduce offspring of the same kind, but that offspring vary and are not identical to their parents or to each other. This natural variation within species is the raw material for natural selection. Genes/chromosomes not required at this stage.

**Teaching guidance:** Explore variation within the class — measure hand span, height, arm length, eye colour, and discuss why no two people are identical (except identical twins, who share DNA). Compare parents and offspring using photographs: children resemble their parents but are not identical to them. Investigate variation in other organisms — leaf size in a species of tree, shell patterns in snails. Distinguish between inherited variation (eye colour, nose shape) and environmental variation (scars, hairstyle, language). At this stage, genes and chromosomes are not required, but the idea that characteristics are passed from parent to offspring through reproduction should be established.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think offspring are exact copies of their parents or an exact 50/50 mix. Offspring inherit a combination of characteristics but the expression is complex and not a simple blend. Some pupils confuse inherited characteristics with learned or environmental characteristics — speaking English is environmental, not inherited. Children may believe that individual organisms can change their characteristics during their lifetime and pass these changes to offspring (Lamarckian inheritance), which is incorrect.

**Key vocabulary:** variation, offspring, parent, inherit, characteristic, feature, similar, different, species, reproduce, identical, unique, trait, generation, diversity

#### SC-KS2-C065 — Adaptation
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that animals and plants have features that help them survive in their particular environment. These adaptations may be structural (camouflage, body shape, insulation) or behavioural. Different environments select for different adaptations.

**Teaching guidance:** Use striking examples of adaptation to engage pupils: polar bear fur (insulation and camouflage), cactus spines (reduced water loss), giraffe neck (reaching high vegetation), woodpecker beak (drilling into wood). Compare organisms from different environments — arctic versus desert, deep sea versus rainforest — and identify how their features help them survive. Challenge pupils to design an imaginary animal adapted to a specific environment, justifying each feature. Investigate examples of camouflage using peppered moth photographs. Distinguish between structural adaptations (physical features) and behavioural adaptations (migration, hibernation, nocturnal activity).

**Common misconceptions:** Children commonly think that individual animals deliberately adapt or choose to develop helpful features in response to their environment (e.g., 'giraffes stretched their necks to reach high leaves'). Adaptation occurs over many generations through natural selection, not within an individual's lifetime. Some pupils think adaptation means animals are perfectly suited to their environment — in reality, organisms are 'good enough' rather than optimal. Children may believe that adaptation is a conscious or intentional process.

**Key vocabulary:** adaptation, adapted, environment, habitat, survive, feature, structural, behavioural, camouflage, predator, prey, competition, advantage, suited, desert, arctic, specialised

#### SC-KS2-C066 — Evolution
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding that adaptation may lead to evolution — that over very long periods of time, variation and natural selection can lead to populations becoming better adapted to their environments and to the development of new species. Work of Darwin and Wallace.

**Teaching guidance:** Build from the concepts of variation, inheritance and adaptation to explain evolution by natural selection: organisms vary; those with advantageous variations are more likely to survive and reproduce; their offspring inherit these variations; over many generations, the population changes. Use the peppered moth example (light moths on soot-covered trees during the Industrial Revolution) as a well-documented case study. Discuss Darwin's and Wallace's contributions and the evidence they gathered. Use simulations (e.g., bird beak tools picking up different 'food' types) to model natural selection. Emphasise the timescale — evolution typically occurs over thousands or millions of years, not within a single lifetime.

**Common misconceptions:** The most common misconception is that individual organisms evolve during their lifetime — evolution occurs across populations over many generations. Children may think evolution has a goal or direction ('aiming' towards a perfect form), when it is an undirected process driven by environmental pressures. Some pupils confuse evolution with metamorphosis (a frog changing from tadpole) or with individual growth. Children may think that evolution means species 'improve' over time, rather than understanding that species become better adapted to their current environment.

**Key vocabulary:** evolution, natural selection, variation, adaptation, inherit, generation, species, survival, reproduce, population, change, Darwin, Wallace, evidence, theory, extinction, ancestor

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS2-D014-CL001:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Food chains, food webs and ecosystems are system models: pupils map components (producers, consumers, decomposers), trace energy flows, and predict what happens when one part changes.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Stability and Change**: What keeps this stable, what causes change, and how quickly does change happen?
  Why: Ecosystems maintain dynamic equilibria that can be disrupted by changes to one component — exploring what keeps the system stable and what destabilises it is an equally powerful framing.
  AI instruction: Use the STABILITY AND CHANGE lens: prompt pupils to identify what conditions keep a system in balance, what disrupts equilibrium, and how change can be gradual or sudden. Useful questions: 'What keeps this the same?', 'What would tip it into change?', 'Is the change reversible?', 'How fast is this changing, and why?'

**SC-KS2-D014-CL002:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Sorting, classifying and identifying similarities directly trains pupils to recognise regularities and use them to predict or generalise.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Evidence and Argument**: What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Drawing conclusions from observations requires constructing a claim supported by specific evidence — not just describing what was seen.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'

**SC-KS2-D014-CL003:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Food chains, food webs and ecosystems are system models: pupils map components (producers, consumers, decomposers), trace energy flows, and predict what happens when one part changes.

#### SC-KS2-CV009 — Evolution and Adaptation (investigation)
Research enquiry exploring how living things have changed over time — fossils as evidence, variation, adaptation, and natural selection (age-appropriate introduction).
Delivers: SC-KS2-C063, SC-KS2-C064, SC-KS2-C065, SC-KS2-C066
Enquiry type: research

Key vocabulary: fossil, evolution, adaptation, variation, natural selection, inherited, species, extinct
Assessment: Can pupils explain how fossils provide evidence for change over time? Can they describe how an organism is adapted to its environment? Can they explain the basic mechanism of natural selection (variation -> selection -> inheritance)?
Success criteria: Explain how fossils provide evidence that living things have changed; Describe how at least 2 organisms are adapted to their environments; Explain that offspring vary and this variation can be inherited; Describe how natural selection leads to evolution over time

## Domain: HI-KS2-D002 — British History
**Subject:** History | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** knowledge

### Curriculum Context
British history at KS2 covers the sweep of British prehistory and early history from the Stone Age to the Norman period, supplemented by a local history study and a thematic study extending beyond 1066. Each period of British history specified in the curriculum has distinctive content: Stone Age to Iron Age covers prehistoric Britain before written records; Roman Britain examines the impact of a major empire on the British Isles; Anglo-Saxons and Vikings covers the transformative period of migration, conversion and conflict between the fifth and eleventh centuries. Pupils develop understanding of how Britain has been shaped by successive waves of migration, invasion and settlement, and how different peoples have contributed to British identity and culture. The requirement to study a local history and a post-1066 theme gives schools flexibility to connect national history to pupils' own environments and to develop longer-range chronological understanding.

### Concepts (1)

#### HI-KS2-C005 — British Historical Periods: Prehistoric to Medieval
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Britain's history from the Stone Age to the Norman Conquest encompasses several distinct periods, each marked by major social, technological and political changes: Prehistoric Britain (Stone, Bronze and Iron Ages); Roman Britain (43-410 AD); Anglo-Saxon Britain (410-1066 AD); and Viking Age Britain (793-1066 AD). Each period represents a distinct phase in the long history of human habitation and society on the British Isles, with different peoples, technologies, political systems, religious beliefs and cultural practices. Understanding these periods gives pupils a foundation in British heritage and the capacity to recognise the long-range development of the society they live in.

**Teaching guidance:** Establish a clear chronological framework for the periods studied: use a timeline that runs from prehistoric times to 1066 and place each topic on it. Study each period in sufficient depth to understand its distinctive character, not just its sequence. Connect periods: how did the Roman occupation affect the Anglo-Saxon period? What did the Vikings find when they arrived? Use artefacts, reconstructions and archaeological evidence alongside textual sources. Connect to local history: are there local Roman roads, Anglo-Saxon place names, Viking settlements?

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may see the historical periods as completely separate rather than as phases in a continuous story. Emphasising connections between periods - the Roman influence on Anglo-Saxon culture, the Viking influence on English - develops more integrated understanding. Pupils may have a romantic rather than realistic view of the Viking or Anglo-Saxon periods; a balanced approach using archaeological and textual evidence avoids both romanticisation and demonisation.

**Key vocabulary:** prehistoric, Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, Roman, Anglo-Saxon, Viking, Norman, invasion, settlement, tribe, kingdom, conquest, legacy, chronology, period

Type: practice
Concepts: HI-KS2-C005 (British Historical Periods: Prehistoric to Medieval)
Rationale: Single concept domain; the sweep from Stone Age to medieval Britain is the major British history content unit at KS2 — pupils trace change and continuity across prehistoric, Iron Age, Roman, Anglo-Saxon and Viking periods, building a chronological framework for later study.
Inspired by: C3 Framework D2.His.2 — classifying historical periods into eras and explaining the criteria used

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**HI-KS2-D002-CL001:**
- **Continuity and Change Over Time** (primary): What has stayed the same, what has changed, and what drove that change?
  Why: The sweep from Stone Age to Norman Conquest is explicitly a study in long-run change and continuity — pupils must trace what shifted (tools, religion, political organisation, language) and what persisted across prehistoric, Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods, building a chronological framework for later study.
  AI instruction: Use the CONTINUITY AND CHANGE OVER TIME lens: prompt pupils to construct timelines, identify turning points, distinguish what changed from what persisted, and explain what drove change. Useful questions: 'What was the same before and after?', 'What was the turning point?', 'Was this a sudden change or a gradual shift?', 'Who or what drove this change?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Each successive wave of change (Roman invasion, Anglo-Saxon migration, Viking raids, Norman Conquest) requires pupils to ask what caused it and what consequences followed, practising causal reasoning at an accessible narrative scale.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

## Domain: HI-KS2-D003 — World History
**Subject:** History | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** knowledge

### Curriculum Context
World history at KS2 gives pupils knowledge and understanding of some of the great civilisations of the ancient world beyond Europe. The curriculum requires study of the earliest civilisations (with choice from Ancient Sumer, Indus Valley, Ancient Egypt, or Shang Dynasty China), Ancient Greece (as a foundational civilisation for Western culture), and a non-European society that offers significant contrast with British history - with examples given as early Islamic civilisation centred on Baghdad around 900 AD, Mayan civilisation around 900 AD, and the kingdom of Benin from around 900 to 1300 AD. These requirements ensure that pupils encounter world history from diverse geographic and cultural perspectives, challenging any narrowly Eurocentric view of significant history. Studying these civilisations also develops pupils' understanding of the long-range development of human society, technology and culture.

### Concepts (1)

#### HI-KS2-C004 — Ancient Civilisations
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

The earliest civilisations - Ancient Sumer, the Indus Valley, Ancient Egypt and the Shang Dynasty of Ancient China - represent the first complex, literate human societies, emerging between approximately 3500 and 1200 BC in different parts of the world. They share characteristic features including writing systems, monumental architecture, complex religious and political hierarchies, specialised crafts and trade networks. Studying these civilisations develops pupils' understanding of how human societies developed from prehistoric hunter-gatherer communities to complex, literate, urban civilisations, and provides global perspective on the origins of human achievement.

**Teaching guidance:** Provide an overview of where and when the earliest civilisations appeared before conducting a depth study of one. Use maps to show that civilisations emerged independently in different parts of the world. Study the key features of the chosen civilisation in depth: its geography, political system, religious beliefs, achievements and daily life. Use artefacts, images of archaeological sites and translations of primary sources where available. Connect to pupils' general chronological framework: how long ago was this civilisation? What was happening in Britain at the same time?

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often think ancient civilisations were primitive or unsophisticated. Studying their technological, artistic and intellectual achievements challenges this. The concept of civilisation can carry value judgements; it is important to discuss what the term means without implying that non-urban societies are inferior. Pupils may not connect ancient civilisations to the present; discussing legacies (alphabet, legal codes, mathematics, architecture) makes the connection explicit.

**Key vocabulary:** civilisation, ancient, Bronze Age, settlement, city-state, pharaoh, hierarchy, irrigation, agriculture, trade, writing, archaeology, artefact, empire, legacy

### ConceptClusters (1)

**HI-KS2-D003-CL001** — Investigate the achievements and legacies of ancient civilisations [CURATED]
Type: practice
Concepts: HI-KS2-C004 (Ancient Civilisations)
Rationale: Single concept domain; ancient civilisations (Egypt, Sumer, Indus Valley, Shang China) are studied as KS2 world history content — pupils examine how early societies organised themselves and what they left behind, developing comparative thinking across cultures.
Inspired by: C3 Framework D2.His.2 — explaining how and why historical periods have been constructed

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**HI-KS2-D003-CL001:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Ancient civilisations are studied as organised societies — pupils examine how early states structured their governance, agriculture, religion and trade as interlocking systems, developing comparative thinking about what makes a civilisation function.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Continuity and Change Over Time**: What has stayed the same, what has changed, and what drove that change?
  Why: Focusing on 'legacies' explicitly asks what from these ancient societies persists into the present (writing systems, legal codes, architectural forms) — a continuity_change frame that gives historical distance meaning for pupils.
  AI instruction: Use the CONTINUITY AND CHANGE OVER TIME lens: prompt pupils to construct timelines, identify turning points, distinguish what changed from what persisted, and explain what drove change. Useful questions: 'What was the same before and after?', 'What was the turning point?', 'Was this a sudden change or a gradual shift?', 'Who or what drove this change?'

## Domain: HI-KS2-D004 — Historical Enquiry and Disciplinary Skills
**Subject:** History | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
At KS2, historical enquiry skills develop in sophistication and rigour. Pupils move beyond basic source use to more analytical engagement with historical evidence, beginning to question sources' reliability, purpose and perspective, and understanding that different historians can interpret the same evidence differently. The conceptual vocabulary of the discipline - cause, consequence, significance, change, continuity, similarity, difference, evidence, interpretation - gives pupils the intellectual tools to think about history as a discipline rather than merely a body of facts. Constructing informed responses to historical questions, and communicating those responses clearly in writing and discussion, develops pupils as active historical thinkers rather than passive recipients of historical narratives.

### Concepts (3)

#### HI-KS2-C001 — Cause and Consequence
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 2

Historical causation involves understanding why events happened - identifying the factors that made an event or change more or less likely, and explaining how those factors combined to produce historical outcomes. Consequence refers to the effects of events or changes - what happened as a result, both immediately and over longer periods. At KS2, pupils develop the ability to identify multiple causes and consequences for historical events, understanding that history is driven by the complex interaction of political, economic, social, religious and individual factors rather than single causes.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach cause and consequence explicitly as analytical concepts, not just as narrative. Use 'because' and 'therefore' to structure causal arguments. Give pupils a range of possible causes and ask them to rank or categorise them. Distinguish between long-term and immediate causes. Explore unintended consequences: what happened that was not planned or predicted? Use historical examples from the periods studied to build up a bank of causal arguments. Help pupils express causal relationships in written historical argument.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often identify single causes for complex historical events, when in reality multiple factors interact. Teaching that causes can be categorised (political, economic, social) and that they interact helps. Pupils may confuse correlation with causation; discussing examples where two things happened at the same time but were not causally related develops more precise thinking. The idea of unintended consequences can be surprising; good historical examples make it concrete.

**Key vocabulary:** cause, consequence, effect, result, factor, reason, led to, because, therefore, impact, outcome, trigger, long-term, short-term, significant, unintended

#### HI-KS2-C002 — Significance
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Historical significance refers to the importance of a person, event or development in history, assessed by criteria such as the scale and duration of its impact, how many people were affected, whether it changed the course of events, whether people at the time thought it important, and how it is remembered and commemorated. Significance is not fixed: what seems significant from one perspective or in one time period may appear less so from another. At KS2, pupils begin to develop explicit criteria for judging historical significance and apply them to the people and events they study.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach explicit criteria for significance: notable (was it important at the time?), remembered (is it still remembered?), resonant (do people connect with it?), resulting (did it have consequences?), remarkable (was it unusual?). Apply these criteria to historical examples. Discuss how significance can change over time - a battle that seemed decisive at the time may look less important with hindsight. Explore why some historical figures and events are remembered while others are forgotten, connecting to discussions of power and representation.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often conflate significance with fame, assuming that well-known figures must be the most significant. Discussing overlooked historical figures who had major impacts challenges this. The idea that significance is judged rather than simply recognised can be counterintuitive; explicit discussion of the criteria for significance helps. Pupils may not realise that significance can be contested - different people may disagree about how significant an event was.

**Key vocabulary:** significance, important, memorable, lasting, impact, remember, commemorate, notable, evaluate, judge, criteria, perspective, evidence, why

#### HI-KS2-C003 — Historical Evidence and Interpretation
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 2

Historians construct interpretations of the past from the evidence that survives. Evidence includes primary sources (created at the time) and secondary sources (created after the fact), each with distinctive strengths and limitations. Historians also interpret the same evidence differently based on their questions, frameworks and perspectives, which is why different historical accounts of the same events can reach different conclusions. At KS2, pupils develop the ability to work with and evaluate a range of historical sources, and to understand that historical knowledge is constructed through the interpretation of evidence rather than simply discovered.

**Teaching guidance:** Develop a systematic approach to source analysis: provenance (who, when, why), content (what does it say/show), utility (what can we learn from it) and reliability (how trustworthy is it and why). Compare sources that offer different perspectives on the same event. Discuss why sources can be biased or incomplete without being worthless. Help pupils understand that all historical accounts, including their textbooks, are interpretations. Use 'big question' enquiries that require pupils to evaluate evidence and construct argued responses.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may believe that written sources are more reliable than other types. Discussing how photographs can be staged, letters can be biased and accounts can be selective challenges this. The concept that a biased source is not necessarily useless requires explicit teaching: a source biased in a particular direction still tells us something about its author's perspective. Pupils may not understand why different historians reach different conclusions; discussing different perspectives and frameworks helps.

**Key vocabulary:** source, evidence, primary, secondary, provenance, reliable, biased, perspective, interpretation, evaluate, corroborate, account, historian, partial, incomplete

Rationale: Cause and consequence (C001) and significance (C002) are linked by co-teach hints — pupils learning to explain why events happened naturally move to evaluating which causes and consequences were most important (significance). These second-order concepts are typically introduced together through a shared historical enquiry question.
Inspired by: C3 Framework D2.His.3 — explaining why individuals and groups held particular perspectives during historical periods

**HI-KS2-D004-CL002** — Evaluate historical evidence and construct interpretations of the past [CURATED]
Type: practice
Sequenced after: HI-KS2-D004-CL001
Concepts: HI-KS2-C003 (Historical Evidence and Interpretation)
Rationale: Historical evidence and interpretation (C003) builds on the causal thinking in cluster 1 — once pupils understand why events happened, they apply source skills to assess how reliably we know what happened, evaluating the range and limitations of surviving evidence.
Inspired by: C3 Framework D2.His.9 — comparing information provided by different historical sources about the past

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**HI-KS2-D004-CL001:**
- **Cause and Effect** (primary): What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: This cluster introduces the second-order concept of causation directly — pupils learn to identify multiple causes, organise them into categories, and trace short and long-term consequences, which is the defining cognitive demand of causal-chain historical reasoning.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'
- **Evidence and Argument**: What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Evaluating significance requires pupils to construct and justify a ranked argument about which causes or consequences matter most, using evidence to support their judgement — the move from description to evidenced evaluation is the key disciplinary step introduced here.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'

**HI-KS2-D004-CL002:**
- **Perspective and Interpretation** (primary): Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?
  Why: Evaluating the range and limitations of surviving evidence requires pupils to ask who created each source, from what standpoint, and for what purpose — making interpretation of perspective the central cognitive challenge rather than mere information retrieval.
  AI instruction: Use the PERSPECTIVE AND INTERPRETATION lens: prompt pupils to identify the author's or actor's viewpoint, consider what information or experience shapes that perspective, look for omissions or contradictions, and compare multiple accounts. Useful questions: 'Who wrote/said this, and why?', 'What might they have left out?', 'How would someone else see this differently?', 'What would change your view?'
- **Evidence and Argument**: What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Assessing how reliably we know what happened demands that pupils distinguish between inference and assertion, weigh the evidential value of different source types, and construct arguments about what the available evidence does and does not support.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'

### Objectives (3)

## Domain: GE-KS2-D001 — Locational Knowledge
**Subject:** Geography | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** knowledge

### Curriculum Context
At KS2, locational knowledge expands from the foundational continent and ocean framework of KS1 to more precise spatial knowledge. Pupils locate countries across Europe and the Americas, and develop understanding of the coordinate system of longitude and latitude that allows any point on Earth to be precisely located. The study of UK counties, cities and regions develops pupils' detailed knowledge of their own country. The addition of key lines of latitude (Equator, Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, Arctic and Antarctic Circles) and the Prime Meridian provides pupils with the geographic grid that scientists, navigators and geographers use to describe global location, connecting geography to science and mathematics. Time zones introduce the concept that place on Earth directly affects lived experience through the timing of day and night.

### Concepts (1)

#### GE-KS2-C001 — Latitude, Longitude and the Global Grid **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 3

Latitude and longitude are a coordinate system used to identify any location on Earth's surface. Lines of latitude run parallel to the Equator and measure distance north or south (0-90 degrees); lines of longitude run from Pole to Pole and measure distance east or west of the Prime Meridian (0-180 degrees). Special lines of latitude - the Equator, Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, and the Arctic and Antarctic Circles - mark significant climatic boundaries. The Prime Meridian (0 degrees longitude) divides the Eastern and Western Hemispheres and is the reference for time zones. At KS2, pupils learn to use this system to locate and describe global position.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach latitude and longitude together as a coordinate system, drawing parallels with grid references on UK maps. Use a globe with clearly marked latitude and longitude lines. Explain the significance of the key lines: the Equator (maximum solar heating), the Tropics (limits of overhead sun), the Arctic/Antarctic Circles (limits of midnight sun). Connect to time zones by showing how 15 degrees of longitude equals one hour of time difference. Use digital mapping tools to give coordinates for familiar places.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils frequently confuse latitude (horizontal lines, measuring north-south) with longitude (vertical lines, measuring east-west). A consistent mnemonic (latitude = flat/horizontal) helps. The fact that the Equator is 0 degrees latitude while the Poles are 90 degrees is sometimes reversed; connecting 0 degrees to 'no tilt' and 90 degrees to 'maximum distance from equator' helps. Pupils may not understand why time zones exist; connecting them to the Earth's rotation and the 24-hour day makes the concept concrete.

**Key vocabulary:** latitude, longitude, Equator, hemisphere, tropic, Arctic, Antarctic, Prime Meridian, coordinate, degree, north, south, east, west, time zone, parallel, meridian

### External Prerequisites (from other domains)
- GE-KS1-C001 (World Geography: Continents and Oceans) → GE-KS2-C001 (Latitude, Longitude and the Global Grid)

### ConceptClusters (1)

**GE-KS2-D001-CL001** — Use latitude, longitude and the global grid to locate places [CURATED] [KEYSTONE]
Type: practice
Concepts: GE-KS2-C001 (Latitude, Longitude and the Global Grid)
Rationale: Single concept domain; latitude and longitude is the defining KS2 locational knowledge skill — pupils build on KS1 atlas use to work with coordinate systems and understand climate patterns linked to latitude.
Inspired by: C3 Framework D2.Geo.1 — using geographic representations including grid coordinates

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**GE-KS2-D001-CL001:**
- **Scale, Proportion and Quantity** (primary): How big, how many, or how much — and how does that change how we think about it?
  Why: Latitude and longitude are quantitative coordinate systems; the cognitive demand is understanding how degrees of arc translate to position on a sphere and why latitude predicts climate — reasoning about proportion and quantity in a spatial context.
  AI instruction: Use the SCALE, PROPORTION AND QUANTITY lens: prompt pupils to compare quantities using ratios and percentages, consider what changes when scale changes, and choose appropriate units of measurement. Useful questions: 'How many times bigger?', 'What fraction of the whole?', 'What changes when we zoom in/out?', 'Which units fit best here?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Linking latitude bands to climate zones introduces the idea that global climate patterns are not random but follow predictable spatial regularities tied to distance from the equator and angle of incoming solar radiation.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

### Objectives (3)

## Domain: GE-KS2-D002 — Place Knowledge
**Subject:** Geography | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** knowledge

### Curriculum Context
Place knowledge at KS2 requires the in-depth study of three distinct regions at different scales and in different parts of the world: a UK region, a European region, and a region in North or South America. Each region study develops pupils' ability to describe, explain and compare the human and physical characteristics of a place, considering how physical geography shapes human activity and how human activity transforms physical landscapes. The comparison of regions from different continents ensures that pupils encounter genuinely diverse human geographies, challenging assumptions based on their own experience and developing the broader perspectives that characterise geographical understanding. These region studies also develop pupils' knowledge of specific places, giving them concrete geographical reference points that support broader spatial learning.

### Concepts (1)

#### GE-KS2-C006 — Regional Place Study and Cross-Continental Comparison
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Place study at a regional scale involves developing in-depth understanding of a geographical region: its physical landscape, climate, vegetation, resources, settlement patterns, economic activity and cultural character. At KS2, pupils study three contrasting regions — a UK region, a European region, and a region within North or South America — comparing their human and physical characteristics across continental contexts. Understanding regions in depth, and comparing across continents, develops the geographical knowledge base and the comparative analytical skills that underpin sophisticated geographical thinking. The cross-continental frame ensures that pupils encounter genuinely diverse human geographies, building awareness of how physical geography (climate, relief, resources) shapes human activity in different parts of the world.

**Teaching guidance:** Choose regions that offer genuine contrast: a mountainous Alpine region in Europe compared with a UK lowland region; an Amazonian region compared with a Caribbean island. Structure each regional study using a consistent inquiry framework: location (where is it?), physical geography (what is the landscape and climate like?), human geography (how do people live and work?), change (how is the region changing?), comparison (how does it compare to the other regions studied?). Use maps, photographs, satellite images, statistical data and firsthand accounts. Avoid reducing regions to stereotypes; show their internal diversity and dynamism. Return to the regions studied across the primary years rather than treating each as a one-off topic.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may treat regional studies as discrete topics rather than as recurring reference points for geographical comparison. Returning to studied regions in different thematic contexts (rivers, climate, development) builds richer knowledge than treating each as a one-off study. Pupils may characterise regions by only one or two features, missing the complexity and internal diversity of real regions. Requiring pupils to update their knowledge of studied regions over time prevents oversimplification.

**Key vocabulary:** region, continent, country, European, Americas, compare, physical geography, human geography, characteristic, settlement, economic activity, climate, landscape, cultural, similarities, differences

Rationale: Single concept domain; regional place study expands KS1 locality comparison to a larger geographical scale — pupils use the full range of geographical enquiry tools to compare human and physical characteristics across continents.
Inspired by: C3 Framework D2.Geo.5 — explaining how cultural and environmental characteristics differ between places

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**GE-KS2-D002-CL001:**
- **Scale, Proportion and Quantity** (primary): How big, how many, or how much — and how does that change how we think about it?
  Why: Expanding from KS1 locality comparison to regional scale requires pupils to reason about how comparisons change when the unit of analysis grows — what similarities and differences are meaningful at regional rather than local scale.
  AI instruction: Use the SCALE, PROPORTION AND QUANTITY lens: prompt pupils to compare quantities using ratios and percentages, consider what changes when scale changes, and choose appropriate units of measurement. Useful questions: 'How many times bigger?', 'What fraction of the whole?', 'What changes when we zoom in/out?', 'Which units fit best here?'
- **Systems and System Models**: What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Applying the full range of geographical enquiry tools to understand a region means treating that region as a system where physical and human factors interact — climate influences economy, topography shapes settlement, which in turn affects culture.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'

### Objectives (1)
- GE-KS2-O004 [statutory]: understand geographical similarities and differences through the study of human and physical geography of a region of the United Kingdom, a region in a European country, and a region within North or South America

## Domain: GE-KS2-D003 — Human and Physical Geography
**Subject:** Geography | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** knowledge

### Curriculum Context
The scope of physical and human geography content expands substantially at KS2, moving from descriptive knowledge of features to explanatory understanding of processes. In physical geography, pupils learn about the major climate zones and biomes of the world, the geomorphological processes that shape rivers, mountains, coasts and volcanoes, and the hydrological cycle that connects land, sea and atmosphere. In human geography, pupils understand how settlements grow, how different types of economic activity are distributed, and how trade and natural resources shape human geography at global scales. This shift from description to explanation marks the most significant progression in geographical thinking at KS2, as pupils learn not just what the world looks like but why it is as it is.

### Concepts (3)

#### GE-KS2-C002 — Climate Zones and Biomes
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Climate zones are large areas of the Earth characterised by similar patterns of temperature and rainfall, determined primarily by latitude. The main climate zones are tropical, subtropical, temperate, continental, polar and mountainous. Biomes are large ecological communities defined by their climate and vegetation: rainforest, savannah, desert, grassland, deciduous forest, coniferous forest, tundra and polar ice. At KS2, pupils develop understanding of how climate shapes the vegetation and wildlife of different regions, connecting physical and biological geography.

**Teaching guidance:** Use world climate and biome maps to show the distribution of different zones. Connect climate zones to latitude using the global grid: equatorial regions are typically tropical, polar regions are cold. Study specific biomes in depth: what are the characteristics, adaptations of plants and animals, human uses? Explore how climate change is altering biome boundaries. Compare a UK biome (temperate deciduous forest) with a contrasting global biome (tropical rainforest or desert). Connect to human geography by exploring how people adapt to different climate zones.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may confuse climate zone with biome; clarifying that climate determines what biome can exist in an area resolves this. Pupils may think deserts are always hot; cold deserts (Gobi, Antarctica) challenge this assumption. The idea that tropical regions are always wet is also inaccurate; tropical wet and dry seasons should be distinguished. Pupils may underestimate how dramatically human activity has altered natural biomes; discussing deforestation and agriculture develops critical awareness.

**Key vocabulary:** climate zone, biome, tropical, temperate, polar, arctic, desert, rainforest, savannah, tundra, vegetation belt, adaptation, precipitation, temperature, ecosystem

#### GE-KS2-C003 — River Systems and the Water Cycle
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

A river system comprises a river and all its tributaries, flowing through a drainage basin from source to mouth. Rivers shape the landscape through the processes of erosion, transportation and deposition, creating characteristic landforms including valleys, meanders, ox-bow lakes, deltas and floodplains. The water cycle describes the continuous movement of water between ocean, atmosphere, land and rivers through processes of evaporation, condensation, precipitation, run-off and infiltration. At KS2, pupils develop understanding of both river processes and the wider hydrological cycle that sustains freshwater systems.

**Teaching guidance:** Use diagrams and models to explain the water cycle, connecting the processes to observable phenomena (clouds, rain, rivers, evaporation). Study a specific river system in detail: trace it from source to mouth on a map, identify key tributaries and settlements, study the features at different stages. Use photographs to study river landforms at different locations. Connect rivers to human activity: water supply, settlements, trade, flooding. Investigate local rivers or streams through fieldwork.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often think rivers flow uphill at some point; careful explanation of how gravity determines flow direction addresses this. The water cycle is often presented too simplistically; exploring the variety of pathways water can take (groundwater, evapotranspiration, run-off) develops more accurate understanding. Pupils may not connect rivers to the water cycle; linking the discussion of river flow to rainfall and precipitation makes the connection explicit.

**Key vocabulary:** river, source, mouth, tributary, drainage basin, meander, flood plain, erosion, deposition, transportation, water cycle, evaporation, condensation, precipitation, run-off, infiltration

#### GE-KS2-C004 — Settlement and Economic Geography
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Settlements are places where people live and work, ranging from small hamlets to megacities. Their location, growth and character are shaped by physical factors (water supply, defensibility, flat land, resources) and human factors (trade routes, industry, government decisions). Economic activity is classified into sectors: primary (extracting raw materials), secondary (manufacturing), tertiary (services) and quaternary (knowledge-based). The distribution of natural resources including food, minerals, energy and water shapes economic activity and trade between places at global scales. At KS2, pupils develop conceptual frameworks for understanding why places are where they are and how economies work.

**Teaching guidance:** Study local settlement history: why was the town/city located here? What factors drove its growth? Compare settlement patterns in different environments: how do desert settlements differ from coastal or riverside ones? Use examples of global trade to illustrate economic interdependence. Investigate the origin of food and goods in the classroom or school. Map the distribution of specific natural resources (oil, minerals, food production) and connect to trade patterns. Explore how economic activity changes over time in a specific area.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may think cities grow randomly rather than for geographical reasons. Studying the historical reasons for settlement location challenges this. The concept of comparative advantage in trade can be difficult; concrete examples of why one place might specialise in particular goods make it accessible. Pupils may not appreciate the scale of global economic interdependence; tracking the journey of a familiar product from raw material to consumer makes global connections tangible.

**Key vocabulary:** settlement, hamlet, village, town, city, conurbation, urbanisation, primary sector, secondary sector, tertiary sector, trade, import, export, natural resource, energy, mineral, distribution

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**GE-KS2-D003-CL001:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: The water cycle is an archetypal system — evaporation, condensation, precipitation and run-off are interconnected processes where a change at one point affects all others; the biome concept similarly treats climate, soils, plants and animals as a functioning ecological system.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Climate zones and biomes are distributed across the globe in recognisable spatial patterns tied to latitude, altitude and ocean currents — recognising these patterns and explaining why they exist is the core cognitive task of this cluster.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**GE-KS2-D003-CL002:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Settlement and economic geography asks pupils to identify why settlements grew where they did — near rivers, transport routes, resources — which is fundamentally about recognising spatial patterns and explaining what determines them.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Understanding how physical factors (river crossing, flat land, natural harbour) caused settlements to grow, and how economic activities in turn shaped the settlement's form and function, requires explicit cause-and-effect reasoning across physical and human geography.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

## Domain: GE-KS2-D004 — Geographical Skills and Fieldwork
**Subject:** Geography | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
Geographical skills at KS2 develop substantially in precision and range. Pupils extend their use of compass directions from four to eight points; they learn to use grid references to locate specific points on Ordnance Survey maps with increasing precision; and they develop the ability to interpret the conventional symbols and topographic information on standard UK maps. Digital and computer mapping tools introduce pupils to GIS (geographical information systems) and satellite mapping as contemporary geographical technologies. Fieldwork at KS2 extends beyond the school grounds to include the wider local environment, incorporating the collection of primary data through observation, sketch maps, plans, graphs and digital technologies. These skills equip pupils to conduct genuine geographical enquiry, asking questions about the world and gathering evidence to answer them.

### Concepts (1)

#### GE-KS2-C005 — Ordnance Survey Maps and Grid References
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Ordnance Survey (OS) maps are detailed topographic maps of Great Britain produced to standard conventions, using a national grid reference system, contour lines to represent relief, and a comprehensive set of conventional symbols. Four-figure grid references identify a 1km grid square; six-figure grid references identify a 100m square within that. The OS map is the primary tool for geographical fieldwork and navigation in the UK context, and the skills required to use it effectively - reading symbols, using grid references, interpreting contours - are core geographical competencies at KS2.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach grid references systematically: 'along the corridor and up the stairs' as a mnemonic for reading eastings before northings. Practice with familiar local OS maps before unfamiliar ones. Teach contour interpretation by connecting the map to photographs and the real landscape. Build proficiency progressively: four-figure references before six-figure. Use the OS map symbol key and test recognition of common symbols. Plan routes using OS maps, calculating distances using scale. Combine with fieldwork by using OS maps in the local area.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils consistently confuse the order of grid references, giving northings before eastings. The 'along the corridor and up the stairs' mnemonic helps, but consistent practice is essential. Contour interpretation is challenging; many pupils cannot readily visualise three-dimensional relief from two-dimensional contour lines. Building up from simple cross-sections and physical models helps. Pupils may not understand that the scale bar means different things at different zoom levels.

**Key vocabulary:** Ordnance Survey, grid reference, easting, northing, contour, elevation, symbol, key, scale, relief, topographic, national grid, four-figure, six-figure, spot height

Type: practice
Concepts: GE-KS2-C005 (Ordnance Survey Maps and Grid References)
Rationale: Single concept domain; OS maps and grid references represent the core KS2 cartographic skill — pupils move from general atlas use to the specialist detail of topographic maps, interpreting contours, symbols and four/six-figure grid references.
Inspired by: C3 Framework D2.Geo.1 — constructing and interpreting geographic representations

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**GE-KS2-D004-CL001:**
- **Evidence and Argument** (primary): What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Interpreting OS map symbols, contours and grid references to describe or navigate a landscape requires treating the map as evidential data and making reasoned spatial arguments about what the landscape must look like based on that evidence.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'
- **Scale, Proportion and Quantity**: How big, how many, or how much — and how does that change how we think about it?
  Why: Understanding map scale, contour intervals and six-figure grid references involves proportional reasoning — translating distances and heights from map to reality and back — which is the quantitative core of this cluster's cognitive demand.
  AI instruction: Use the SCALE, PROPORTION AND QUANTITY lens: prompt pupils to compare quantities using ratios and percentages, consider what changes when scale changes, and choose appropriate units of measurement. Useful questions: 'How many times bigger?', 'What fraction of the whole?', 'What changes when we zoom in/out?', 'Which units fit best here?'

## Domain: AD-KS2-D001 — Developing Techniques and Mastery
**Subject:** Art and Design | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
At KS2, pupils build upon the exploratory work of KS1 to develop greater technical mastery and intentional control of materials and processes. The curriculum specifies improvement in drawing, painting and sculpture across a range of materials including pencil, charcoal, paint and clay, with pupils expected to work with creativity, experimentation and an increasing awareness of different kinds of art, craft and design. This domain is central to the KS2 curriculum because it shifts pupils from exploration to craft, developing the understanding that mastery requires deliberate practice and critical self-evaluation. Pupils begin to make conscious choices about which techniques and materials serve their creative intentions, rather than simply trying things out.

### Concepts (4)

#### AD-KS2-C001 — Drawing Mastery
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 2

At KS2, drawing develops from exploratory mark-making to more controlled, purposeful and technically sophisticated work. Pupils learn to use a wider range of drawing tools and to vary line quality, tone and mark-making techniques to achieve different effects, including observational drawing and drawing from imagination. The concept of mastery implies deliberate practice, critical self-evaluation and progressive improvement over time.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce pencil grading (H to B) and demonstrate how different pressures and angles create different marks. Teach shading techniques including hatching, cross-hatching and blending. Set regular observational drawing tasks from natural objects, still life and the environment. Use charcoal for tonal work and bold expressive drawing. Encourage pupils to compare drawings over time and identify areas of improvement. Connect drawing to sketchbook practice as a way of developing ideas.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may equate drawing mastery with photographic accuracy rather than expressive control. Teaching that great artists develop personal styles reinforces that mastery is about intentional choices. Some pupils give up if their first attempt does not match expectation; scaffolding with structured practice builds resilience and the understanding that skill is developed over time.

**Key vocabulary:** tone, shade, gradient, hatching, cross-hatching, contour, proportion, perspective, observation, detail, composition, charcoal, graphite, tonal range

#### AD-KS2-C002 — Painting Mastery
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Building on KS1 colour exploration, KS2 pupils develop greater control in mixing, applying and layering paint to achieve specific expressive and representational effects. They learn about colour theory including complementary and harmonious colours, warm and cool palettes, and how artists use colour deliberately to create mood, depth and compositional focus.

**Teaching guidance:** Explore a wider range of paints including watercolour, acrylic and poster paint. Teach colour mixing in more depth, covering warm and cool colours, complementary pairs, and how to create neutrals and earthy tones. Study how artists such as Monet, Van Gogh or Klimt used colour expressively. Teach techniques such as wet-on-wet watercolour, impasto and glazing. Encourage pupils to plan colour choices in sketchbooks before committing to final paintings.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may believe colour mixing is unpredictable. Systematic colour mixing activities build understanding of predictable outcomes. Some pupils mix too many colours resulting in muddy browns; teaching about complementary pairs and limited palettes addresses this. Pupils may not connect colour choices to emotional or compositional intent.

**Key vocabulary:** complementary, harmonious, warm, cool, tint, shade, hue, intensity, wet-on-wet, impasto, glaze, wash, palette, saturated, neutral

#### AD-KS2-C003 — Sculpture Mastery
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

At KS2, pupils develop greater technical control and creative ambition in three-dimensional work. They learn to use materials such as clay, wire, card and found objects with increasing skill, understanding how structural decisions affect the stability, form and visual impact of a sculpture. Pupils also develop awareness of how sculptors work across a range of traditions and purposes.

**Teaching guidance:** Build on KS1 clay work with more complex techniques such as coil building, slab construction and surface decoration. Use wire armatures to support larger-scale figures or abstract forms. Explore mixed-media sculpture combining multiple materials. Study a range of sculptors from different cultures and periods. Encourage pupils to plan three-dimensional work through sketches and maquettes before making final pieces.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may focus on surface decoration at the expense of structural integrity. Teaching basic structural principles prevents this. Some pupils may not see sculpture as a legitimate mode of artistic expression compared to drawing and painting; a rich diet of sculptural examples challenges this. Planning in 2D before working in 3D is a skill that requires explicit modelling.

**Key vocabulary:** sculpture, three-dimensional, relief, armature, coil, slab, pinch, carve, assemble, texture, form, space, maquette, installation

#### AD-KS2-C006 — Creativity and Experimentation
Type: process | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Creativity in art and design involves generating original ideas, making unexpected connections and being willing to experiment beyond familiar approaches. The KS2 curriculum explicitly requires pupils to approach their art making with creativity and experimentation, developing an increasing awareness of different kinds of art, craft and design. This concept involves taking creative risks, exploring different possibilities and developing a personal artistic voice.

**Teaching guidance:** Set open-ended creative briefs that allow diverse responses. Reward risk-taking and unusual approaches. Use warm-up activities that free pupils from concern about outcomes. Teach techniques for generating ideas such as mind-mapping, collage, random juxtapositions and working from imagination as well as observation. Discuss how famous artists experimented throughout their careers and how their work evolved.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may equate creativity with natural talent and believe it cannot be developed. Teaching that creativity involves learnable strategies and habits of mind addresses this. Some pupils may need explicit permission to make unusual choices or to depart from conventional approaches. Evaluation of creative risk-taking should reward the process of exploration, not only the quality of final outcomes.

**Key vocabulary:** experiment, explore, original, creative, invent, imagination, risk, develop, combine, transform, investigate, unconventional, personal style

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**AD-KS2-D001-CL001:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Mastery of drawing and painting requires understanding how specific material properties (pencil hardness, paint viscosity, brush type) determine the marks that can be made — structure directly constrains and enables expressive function.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Tonal control and deliberate mark-making involve identifying and reproducing graduated visual patterns; progressive skill development is itself a pattern of refinement across repeated practice episodes.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**AD-KS2-D001-CL002:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Sculpture requires understanding how three-dimensional materials behave structurally — how form can be built, carved or modelled — and creative experimentation tests those structural limits to discover new expressive possibilities.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Experimentation across media involves noticing repeating surface patterns, textures and formal relationships that emerge across different sculptural approaches and materials.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next.

## Domain: AD-KS2-D002 — Sketchbooks and Observational Practice
**Subject:** Art and Design | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
Sketchbooks are introduced at KS2 as a key tool for artistic development, mirroring the working practice of professional artists and designers. They provide a space for pupils to record observations of the world around them, experiment with techniques and materials, collect visual research and develop ideas before committing to a final outcome. The educational rationale is that sketchbooks make visible the iterative, exploratory nature of creativity and teach pupils that effective making involves planning, revision and reflection rather than a single attempt. Pupils learn to see their sketchbook as a resource to return to, building habits of visual curiosity and careful looking that serve them throughout their artistic education.

### Concepts (1)

#### AD-KS2-C004 — Sketchbook as Creative Tool
Type: process | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 2

A sketchbook is a personal working document used by artists to record observations, collect ideas, experiment with techniques and develop thinking over time. At KS2, pupils learn to use sketchbooks as an integral part of their creative process, treating them as a living record of their developing ideas rather than a place for finished work. This concept models the iterative, exploratory nature of creative practice.

**Teaching guidance:** Give each pupil their own sketchbook and establish a culture where it is used regularly throughout the year. Encourage pupils to fill pages with quick sketches, notes, material samples and test marks as well as more developed studies. Set specific sketchbook tasks such as observational drawings, colour experiments and responses to works of art. Teach pupils to annotate their sketchbooks with reflections. Treat sketchbooks as evidence of creative thinking and reward exploration rather than only finished quality.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often treat sketchbooks as finished work books, producing neat drawings on blank pages. The idea that messy, exploratory work is valuable needs explicit modelling by teachers. Some pupils may not see the connection between sketchbook work and final outcomes; structured links between exploration and making phases are essential.

**Key vocabulary:** observation, record, annotate, develop, revisit, experiment, plan, research, collect, reflect, process, iteration, working drawing, visual diary

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**AD-KS2-D002-CL001:**
- **Evidence and Argument** (primary): What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: The sketchbook functions as a record of visual evidence — observations, experiments, annotations — from which ideas are developed and justified; pupils learn to use their own recorded evidence to make and support creative decisions.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'
- **Structure and Function**: How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Understanding the sketchbook as a structured working document (not just a notebook) requires grasping how different types of recording — thumbnail sketches, colour tests, annotations — each serve a distinct function in the creative process.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'

## Domain: AD-KS2-D003 — Art History: Great Artists, Architects and Designers
**Subject:** Art and Design | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** knowledge

### Curriculum Context
This domain extends pupils' cultural and historical knowledge of art and design by focusing on significant practitioners across history, with explicit inclusion of architects and designers as well as artists. Pupils learn that great works of art and design are located within historical periods and social contexts, and that practitioners have been influenced by the world around them and by each other's innovations. KS2 pupils are expected to make active connections between historical examples and their own creative work, using the work of great practitioners as inspiration, reference and a source of critical dialogue. This domain builds the disciplinary knowledge that enables pupils to engage meaningfully with art history and cultural heritage, and to situate their own creative work within a broader tradition.

### Concepts (1)

#### AD-KS2-C005 — Art History: Artists, Architects and Designers
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Great artists, architects and designers throughout history have developed distinctive styles and approaches that reflect the social, cultural and historical contexts of their time. At KS2, pupils learn to place significant practitioners within historical periods and begin to understand how their work has shaped art history and influenced subsequent practitioners. The explicit inclusion of architects and designers broadens pupils' understanding beyond fine art.

**Teaching guidance:** Study a diverse selection of artists, architects and designers across different historical periods, cultures and disciplines. Include both canonical and less well-known examples, and deliberately include non-Western and contemporary practitioners. Use high-quality reproductions and, where possible, visits to galleries and museums. Set projects that use specific practitioners as starting points. Teach pupils to describe, interpret and evaluate works of art using appropriate language drawn from the formal elements.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may see art history as a list of names and dates. Connecting historical examples to pupils' own work and to contemporary practice makes history meaningful. Pupils may not appreciate non-Western art traditions; deliberately including diverse examples challenges Eurocentric assumptions. The division between fine art, craft and design can create a false hierarchy that needs to be questioned.

**Key vocabulary:** Renaissance, Impressionism, Modernism, movement, period, style, influence, tradition, architect, designer, sculptor, painter, historical context, cultural context

**AD-KS2-D003-CL001:**
- **Perspective and Interpretation** (primary): Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?
  Why: Studying significant practitioners requires pupils to understand works from within the artist's historical context and intention, not just react aesthetically — making interpretive stance the core cognitive demand.
  AI instruction: Use the PERSPECTIVE AND INTERPRETATION lens: prompt pupils to identify the author's or actor's viewpoint, consider what information or experience shapes that perspective, look for omissions or contradictions, and compare multiple accounts. Useful questions: 'Who wrote/said this, and why?', 'What might they have left out?', 'How would someone else see this differently?', 'What would change your view?'
- **Continuity and Change Over Time**: What has stayed the same, what has changed, and what drove that change?
  Why: Studying great artists and designers 'throughout history' explicitly positions art knowledge as a chronological narrative where styles, techniques and ideas develop, persist or break with precedent across time.
  AI instruction: Use the CONTINUITY AND CHANGE OVER TIME lens: prompt pupils to construct timelines, identify turning points, distinguish what changed from what persisted, and explain what drove change. Useful questions: 'What was the same before and after?', 'What was the turning point?', 'Was this a sudden change or a gradual shift?', 'Who or what drove this change?'

## Domain: MU-KS2-D001 — Performing in Solo and Ensemble Contexts
**Subject:** Music | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
At KS2, performance develops significantly in sophistication. Pupils perform both as soloists and in ensembles, and the curriculum specifies increasing accuracy, fluency, control and expression as the goals of this development. These four qualities mark the progression from competent playing to genuinely musical performance: accuracy concerns correctness of pitch and rhythm; fluency concerns smoothness and ease of delivery; control concerns management of the technical demands; and expression concerns communicating musical meaning and emotion. Pupils should have the opportunity to learn a musical instrument, and classroom ensembles provide the social and musical experience of playing with others, developing listening, coordination and responsibility for one's musical contribution.

### Concepts (1)

#### MU-KS2-C001 — Ensemble Performance Skills
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Ensemble performance requires musicians to listen to and coordinate with others while maintaining their own part, developing skills of listening, timing, balance and musical communication. At KS2, pupils develop the ability to play in groups, adjust their contribution to the ensemble, follow a conductor and manage the social and musical demands of collaborative music making.

**Teaching guidance:** Create regular ensemble opportunities in whole-class instrumental lessons, recorder groups, or percussion ensembles. Teach pupils to listen across the ensemble while playing their own part. Use simple conducting gestures to direct starts, stops and dynamic changes. Develop listening challenges: can pupils hear all the parts? Can they identify when their part is dominant and when it should blend? Use rounds and partner songs to develop independent part-playing.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often focus only on their own part and do not listen to others in an ensemble. Teaching that ensemble music requires active listening as well as playing is key. Some pupils may feel that playing quietly means playing badly; teaching about musical balance and the importance of dynamic blend within an ensemble addresses this.

**Key vocabulary:** ensemble, solo, blend, balance, part, conductor, cue, coordination, listen, independent, unison, harmony

**MU-KS2-D001-CL001:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Ensemble performance is a system in which individual parts must function in coordinated relationship — listening, balance, cueing and musical communication are all properties of the ensemble as an interdependent system rather than of individual players.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Accuracy and fluency in performance depend on internalising rhythmic and melodic patterns deeply enough to reproduce them reliably under the added cognitive load of ensemble coordination.

## Domain: MU-KS2-D002 — Improvising and Composing
**Subject:** Music | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
At KS2, pupils extend their KS1 sound exploration to more structured improvisation and composition, developing understanding of how musical ideas are organised into compositions. The curriculum specifies that pupils should organise and manipulate ideas within musical structures and reproduce sounds from aural memory, indicating a more deliberate and structurally aware approach to composition. Improvisation teaches pupils to make spontaneous musical decisions, developing musical fluency and creative confidence. Composition for a range of purposes introduces the idea that music is created in response to contexts, briefs and audiences, connecting music making to communication and expression.

### Concepts (2)

#### MU-KS2-C002 — Improvisation
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Improvisation is the creation of music spontaneously in performance, without prior written notation. It requires musical knowledge and skill, creative confidence and the ability to make instant decisions. At KS2, pupils develop improvisation skills through structured activities that provide a framework (scale, rhythm, harmonic context) within which they can make free musical choices.

**Teaching guidance:** Begin with very structured improvisation frameworks - improvise using only two or three notes over a drone or ostinato. Gradually increase freedom by expanding the note set or the rhythmic palette. Use call-and-response structures. Encourage pupils to improvise short phrases and to listen to and build on each other's ideas. Discuss the difference between improvisation (spontaneous) and composition (planned). Connect to listening by pointing out improvisation in jazz and world music examples.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often fear improvisation because they believe there is a 'right answer'. Framing improvisation as creative exploration rather than performance of a correct sequence helps. Some pupils may produce random sequences of notes rather than musical phrases; teaching phrase length and resolution helps develop more musical improvisation.

**Key vocabulary:** improvise, spontaneous, phrase, motif, scale, drone, ostinato, response, idea, explore, create, structure

#### MU-KS2-C003 — Musical Structure and Composition
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Musical structure refers to the way a composition is organised over time - how musical ideas are introduced, developed, contrasted and repeated. Common structural forms include binary (AB), ternary (ABA), rondo (ABACADA) and theme and variations. At KS2, pupils develop understanding of musical structure as they compose music for a range of purposes, learning to organise musical ideas intentionally.

**Teaching guidance:** Analyse structure in listening examples by identifying where ideas return, contrast and develop. Use graphic notation or simple letter notation (A, B, C) to map the structure of pieces. Set composition tasks that require pupils to use a specific structure. Encourage revision of compositional structure in the light of evaluation. Connect structure to the purpose of the music - a lullaby might have repetitive, soothing sections; a piece for a film chase scene would have contrasting fast and slow sections.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often compose music that simply continues without structural contrast or repetition, resulting in a stream of unconnected ideas. Teaching basic structural forms and asking pupils to plan structure before composing prevents this. Some pupils may repeat material too mechanically; discussing how professional composers introduce subtle variations of repeated material develops more sophisticated structural thinking.

**Key vocabulary:** structure, form, binary, ternary, rondo, verse, chorus, bridge, motif, theme, variation, contrast, repetition, development

  Why: Musical Structure and Composition (C003) makes structure the explicit object of compositional learning — understanding how sections, motifs and structural forms organise musical material to create coherent expressive effect.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Improvisation develops the ability to generate melodic and rhythmic patterns spontaneously within stylistic constraints; composition extends this by deliberately selecting, combining and repeating patterns to create planned musical architecture.

### Curriculum Context
Active and discriminating listening is central to KS2 music education. Pupils listen with attention to detail, identifying and describing musical features, structures and expressive devices with increasing sophistication. The development of aural memory - the ability to recall and reproduce sounds - is a specific target, connecting listening to performing and composing. Pupils are expected to appreciate and understand a wide range of high-quality live and recorded music drawn from different traditions and from great composers and musicians, and to develop an understanding of the history of music, giving listening a historical and cultural dimension that supports broader musical understanding.

### Concepts (1)

#### MU-KS2-C005 — Music History and Cultural Context
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Music has a rich history spanning many centuries and cultures, with different traditions, genres and styles each having distinctive features and contexts. At KS2, pupils develop understanding of the history of music and appreciation for a wide range of musical traditions, including the works of great composers and musicians. This historical and cultural knowledge enriches pupils' listening and informs their own musical making.

**Teaching guidance:** Use listening examples from a wide range of historical periods and musical traditions, including Western classical, folk, jazz, world music and popular music. Connect composers and their music to their historical context - what was happening in the world when this music was written? Use simple timelines to place music historically. Connect music history to history in other subjects. Encourage pupils to develop preferences and to articulate why they prefer certain music using musical vocabulary.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may assume that 'good' music means Western classical music. Deliberately presenting diverse musical traditions as equally valid challenges this. Pupils may not understand that musical preferences are shaped by culture and experience; discussing how exposure influences taste develops critical musical understanding.

**MU-KS2-D003-CL001:**
- **Perspective and Interpretation** (primary): Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?
  Why: Appreciating music from diverse traditions and historical periods requires pupils to listen from within unfamiliar aesthetic frameworks — recognising that what counts as musical quality is culturally and historically situated, not universal.
  AI instruction: Use the PERSPECTIVE AND INTERPRETATION lens: prompt pupils to identify the author's or actor's viewpoint, consider what information or experience shapes that perspective, look for omissions or contradictions, and compare multiple accounts. Useful questions: 'Who wrote/said this, and why?', 'What might they have left out?', 'How would someone else see this differently?', 'What would change your view?'
- **Continuity and Change Over Time**: What has stayed the same, what has changed, and what drove that change?
  Why: The historical dimension of this cluster — encountering music across different periods — requires pupils to notice how musical styles, conventions and cultural functions have evolved, persisted and changed across time.
  AI instruction: Use the CONTINUITY AND CHANGE OVER TIME lens: prompt pupils to construct timelines, identify turning points, distinguish what changed from what persisted, and explain what drove change. Useful questions: 'What was the same before and after?', 'What was the turning point?', 'Was this a sudden change or a gradual shift?', 'Who or what drove this change?'

## Domain: MU-KS2-D004 — Musical Notation
**Subject:** Music | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** knowledge

### Curriculum Context
KS2 introduces formal staff notation as a tool for reading and recording musical ideas. Pupils learn to use both staff notation and other relevant notations, understanding that notation is a means of communicating musical ideas rather than an end in itself. The ability to read notation supports performance by allowing pupils to learn new pieces independently and to rehearse from written scores. Understanding notation also supports composition by giving pupils a way to record and share their musical ideas. Staff notation connects music education to a long written tradition and to the practice of professional musicians and composers.

### Concepts (1)

#### MU-KS2-C004 — Staff Notation
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Staff notation is the standardised system of writing music using a five-line stave, clefs, note heads and rhythmic values. It allows music to be written down accurately and communicated to performers who have not heard the piece. At KS2, pupils learn to read and write staff notation, beginning with treble clef notes and simple rhythmic values, connecting this to their instrumental learning and composition work.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce staff notation in the context of instrumental learning, connecting written symbols to sounds pupils already know. Use mnemonics for note names (Every Good Boy Deserves Football for EGBDF). Practice reading short melodic fragments by ear first, then by sight. Teach rhythmic values (crotchet, minim, quaver) alongside their sound and feel. Use pupils' own compositions as a context for notation practice. Emphasise that notation represents sound; always connect written symbols to the sounds they represent.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils sometimes learn note names as abstract symbols without connecting them to specific sounds on their instrument. Always reinforcing the sound alongside the symbol prevents disconnected learning. The time signature is often misunderstood as a fraction rather than as information about pulse grouping; consistent practical activities reinforce its musical meaning.

**Key vocabulary:** stave, clef, treble, note, pitch, crotchet, minim, semibreve, quaver, bar line, time signature, rest, sharp, flat, natural

  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Structure and Function**: How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Understanding notation as a communication system means grasping how structural conventions (clef, time signature, note values) serve the function of precisely encoding and transmitting musical ideas across time and between musicians.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'

### Objectives (1)
- MU-KS2-O004 [statutory]: use and understand staff and other musical notations

## Domain: DT-KS2-D001 — Design
**Subject:** Design and Technology | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
At KS2, the design domain requires pupils to conduct research to understand user needs and to use that research to inform the development of design criteria. Pupils move beyond simple drawing to use annotated sketches, cross-sectional and exploded diagrams, prototypes, pattern pieces and computer-aided design as communication tools. The progression from KS1 is marked by the introduction of research, the explicit consideration of specific target users or groups, and the use of more sophisticated visual communication methods. Pupils learn that effective design is evidence-based and user-centred, and that design ideas need to be communicated clearly enough to be made by others.

### Concepts (2)

#### DT-KS2-C001 — Research-Informed Design
Type: process | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

At KS2, effective design is grounded in research that identifies the needs, preferences and constraints relevant to a product. Research may involve interviewing potential users, examining existing products, investigating materials, or exploring relevant contexts. The findings from research are used to develop design criteria that shape the design process and provide the basis for evaluation.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach pupils to conduct structured research before designing - this could include interviews with target users, surveys, product analysis or contextual investigation. Model how to translate research findings into design criteria. Show examples of real product development processes where research has informed design. Provide structured templates that connect research findings to design decisions. Discuss what makes a product 'fit for purpose' in terms of user needs.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may begin designing before completing meaningful research. Establishing the design brief and research phase as required steps prevents this. Some pupils conflate research with simply looking at existing products without identifying specific needs or constraints.

**Key vocabulary:** research, user need, target user, design brief, design criteria, fit for purpose, context, investigate, analyse, inform

#### DT-KS2-C002 — Technical Drawing and Design Communication
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Technical drawing involves representing design ideas using conventions that communicate information about how a product looks, how it is constructed and how its parts relate to each other. At KS2, pupils learn to use annotated sketches, cross-sectional diagrams, exploded diagrams, pattern pieces and computer-aided design to communicate their ideas clearly and accurately to others who will make or evaluate the product.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach specific drawing conventions including labelling, dimensioning and cross-sections. Practice exploded diagrams to show how components fit together. Introduce appropriate computer-aided design tools for generating and presenting design ideas. Discuss why designers need to communicate their ideas clearly to others, such as when a design is made by someone other than the designer. Compare technical drawings with artistic drawings to highlight different purposes.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may treat all drawing in DT as artistic expression rather than technical communication. Establishing that technical drawing has specific conventions and purposes helps. Some pupils may find exploded and cross-sectional diagrams conceptually challenging; building up from physical disassembly of real objects helps develop the mental model.

**Key vocabulary:** annotated sketch, cross-section, exploded diagram, prototype, pattern piece, computer-aided design, dimension, label, scale, proportion

### ConceptClusters (1)

**DT-KS2-D001-CL001** — Use research and design criteria to develop and communicate design ideas [CURATED]
Type: practice
Concepts: DT-KS2-C001 (Research-Informed Design), DT-KS2-C002 (Technical Drawing and Design Communication)
Rationale: Research-informed design (C001) and technical drawing/design communication (C002) are the two facets of the KS2 design phase: research generates and validates the design criteria, while technical drawing communicates the design ideas clearly enough to be made. They are always taught together as the expanded design phase at KS2.
Inspired by: NC DT KS2: use research and develop design criteria; annotated sketches, exploded diagrams, computer-aided design

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**DT-KS2-D001-CL001:**
- **Evidence and Argument** (primary): What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Research-informed design requires pupils to use evidence gathered about user needs and existing products to justify their design criteria — each design decision becomes a claim that must be supported by research evidence.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'
- **Structure and Function**: How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Technical drawing (annotated sketches, exploded diagrams) communicates not just what the product looks like but how its structure will enable its function — annotating design decisions makes the structure-function reasoning explicit.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'

### Objectives (2)
- DT-KS2-O001 [statutory]: use research and develop design criteria to inform the design of innovative, functional, appealing products that are fit for purpose, aimed at particular individuals or groups
- DT-KS2-O002 [statutory]: generate, develop, model and communicate their ideas through discussion, annotated sketches, cross-sectional and exploded diagrams, prototypes, pattern pieces and computer-aided design

## Domain: DT-KS2-D002 — Make
**Subject:** Design and Technology | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
The make domain at KS2 extends pupils' practical skills to include more complex tools, equipment and processes, and introduces the concept of accuracy as a design requirement. Pupils select from a wider range of materials considering both their functional properties (strength, flexibility, conductivity) and their aesthetic qualities (colour, texture, pattern), demonstrating more sophisticated material knowledge. The emphasis on accuracy reflects the increased complexity of KS2 products and the expectation that pupils can execute their designs with precision. Practical skills are developed in the context of purposeful making across different material areas.

### Concepts (2)

#### DT-KS2-C006 — Accurate Making and Material Processing
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Accurate making refers to the ability to execute practical tasks — measuring, marking out, cutting, shaping, joining and finishing — with precision so that a product matches the design intention and meets functional requirements. At KS2, pupils develop accuracy as a deliberate goal, understanding that imprecise making produces products that do not work correctly or are of poor quality. Material processing knowledge — understanding how different materials respond to cutting, bending, folding, sewing or mixing — enables pupils to select and apply the most effective technique for the material and task at hand.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach measuring and marking out as essential precursors to cutting: measure twice, cut once. Provide opportunities to practise cutting accurately to a marked line with different tools on different materials. Introduce the concept of tolerance: how close to the intended dimension does a measurement need to be for the product to function? Compare products made with and without careful measuring to demonstrate the importance of accuracy. Develop vocabulary for processing different materials: score and fold (card), cut and sew (fabric), chop and mix (food), drill and screw (wood and plastic).

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may rush the measuring and marking stage, leading to cumulative inaccuracies in the finished product. Establishing that time spent measuring carefully is recovered by avoiding mistakes during making is an important lesson. Some pupils equate more material or more joins with a stronger or better product, rather than understanding that precision in fewer, well-executed joins is more effective.

**Key vocabulary:** accuracy, measure, mark out, cut, shape, join, finish, tolerance, material, process, technique, precision, tool, equipment, quality

#### DT-KS2-C007 — Functional and Aesthetic Material Properties
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Materials have both functional properties — characteristics that determine how they perform in use, such as strength, flexibility, conductivity and waterproofness — and aesthetic properties — characteristics that determine how they appear and feel, such as colour, texture, pattern, translucency and surface quality. At KS2, pupils learn to consider both dimensions when selecting materials for a design task, understanding that a material must be both functionally suitable and appropriately appealing for the product to succeed. This concept extends KS1 material knowledge by making the functional/aesthetic distinction explicit.

**Teaching guidance:** Present materials selection tasks that require pupils to balance functional and aesthetic considerations: a container for a child's lunchbox must be both waterproof and visually appealing. Develop systematic material analysis using both dimensions as headings. Discuss real products where functional and aesthetic considerations are in tension — why is medical equipment often plain white rather than brightly coloured? Practise explaining material choices in terms of both functional performance and aesthetic suitability. Investigate how surface finishing techniques can modify aesthetic properties without changing functional ones.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may select materials primarily for their aesthetics (choosing the prettiest fabric) without considering functional requirements. They may also go to the opposite extreme and choose only on functional grounds, producing products that work but are unappealing. Teaching that effective material selection balances both dimensions addresses either tendency.

**Key vocabulary:** functional, aesthetic, property, material, strength, flexibility, conductivity, waterproof, texture, colour, pattern, translucent, opaque, surface, finish

### External Prerequisites (from other domains)
- DT-KS1-C008 (Tools, Equipment and Safe Making) → DT-KS2-C006 (Accurate Making and Material Processing)
- DT-KS1-C003 (Materials and Their Characteristics) → DT-KS2-C007 (Functional and Aesthetic Material Properties)

### ConceptClusters (1)

**DT-KS2-D002-CL001** — Make accurately using appropriate tools, materials and processes [CURATED]
Type: practice
Concepts: DT-KS2-C006 (Accurate Making and Material Processing), DT-KS2-C007 (Functional and Aesthetic Material Properties)
Rationale: Accurate making (C006) and functional/aesthetic material properties (C007) are deeply intertwined at KS2: selecting the right material (C007) is inseparable from executing the making with precision (C006). Both concepts are practised simultaneously in every making project and naturally co-taught.
Inspired by: NC DT KS2: select from and accurately use a wider range of tools, equipment and materials

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**DT-KS2-D002-CL001:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Selecting functional and aesthetic material properties for a specific application requires pupils to match material characteristics to the structural and functional demands of the product — a direct structure-function reasoning task.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Accurate making involves understanding how tool choices and process sequences cause different surface or structural outcomes — a pupil choosing the wrong cutting technique or material treatment must reason about the causal effect on the finished product.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

### Objectives (2)
- DT-KS2-O003 [statutory]: select from and use a wider range of tools and equipment to perform practical tasks [for example, cutting, shaping, joining and finishing], accurately
- DT-KS2-O004 [statutory]: select from and use a wider range of materials and components, including construction materials, textiles and ingredients, according to their functional properties and aesthetic qualities

## Domain: DT-KS2-D003 — Evaluate
**Subject:** Design and Technology | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
The evaluate domain at KS2 becomes more analytically rigorous, requiring pupils to investigate and analyse existing products in depth. Pupils evaluate their own work against design criteria and also consider the views of others, introducing the concept of user feedback as part of the design process. A distinctive addition at KS2 is the requirement to understand how key events and individuals in design and technology have helped shape the world, giving pupils historical and cultural perspective on the subject. This domain develops pupils' ability to think critically about products, processes and the broader impact of design and technology on society.

### Concepts (2)

#### DT-KS2-C008 — Product Investigation and Analysis
Type: process | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Product investigation involves systematically examining existing products to understand their purpose, intended users, materials, construction methods, mechanisms, aesthetics and how successfully they fulfil their design intent. At KS2, investigation is more structured and analytical than at KS1: pupils use frameworks to compare products, consider both strengths and limitations, and relate findings to their own design work. Understanding how existing products solve design problems is a valuable source of design inspiration and technical knowledge.

**Teaching guidance:** Provide a range of products for pupils to disassemble, examine and discuss. Use a consistent analytical framework: purpose, user, materials, construction, mechanisms, aesthetics, fitness for purpose, cost, sustainability. Encourage comparison between similar products: how does product A solve the problem differently from product B? Connect product analysis to design: what can we learn from this product that will inform our own design? Invite pupils to evaluate how well each product meets its intended purpose and to suggest improvements. Use products from different periods and cultures to build historical and cultural awareness.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may describe products superficially (colour, size, shape) without analysing function, materials or construction. Teaching structured analytical frameworks develops deeper investigation. Some pupils equate 'analyse' with criticise; framing investigation as learning from the solutions others have found is more productive and more accurate.

**Key vocabulary:** investigate, analyse, existing product, purpose, user, material, construction, mechanism, aesthetic, fitness for purpose, evaluate, compare, strength, limitation, improvement

#### DT-KS2-C009 — History and Influence of Design and Technology
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Design and technology has been shaped by key individuals, inventions, events and movements that have transformed how people live, work and communicate. Understanding the historical development of design and technology — from Isambard Kingdom Brunel's engineering to the Apple Macintosh, from the spinning jenny to the Internet — gives pupils perspective on design as a human activity with cultural significance and social impact. At KS2, pupils are introduced to significant moments and people in the history of design and technology and consider how these have influenced the products and systems we use today.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce significant figures in design and technology history with a focus on the problems they were solving and how their solutions changed the world. Connect historical design to contemporary products: how is a modern bridge or bicycle derived from earlier designs? Use timelines to situate developments in historical context. Investigate how design and technology reflects the values and needs of different historical periods. Discuss how design has also created problems: pollution, obsolescence, inequality — alongside its benefits.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may think of design and technology history as a simple story of progress from primitive to advanced. Understanding that design always reflects its cultural context, and that some past innovations created new problems, gives a more nuanced picture. Pupils may not understand the difference between invention (creating something new) and innovation (improving or applying existing ideas); most design and technology history involves both.

**Key vocabulary:** history, inventor, innovation, influence, designer, engineer, industrial revolution, patent, legacy, technology, development, impact, society, culture, evolution

### ConceptClusters (1)

**DT-KS2-D003-CL001** — Investigate existing products and understand the history of design and technology [CURATED]
Type: practice
Concepts: DT-KS2-C008 (Product Investigation and Analysis), DT-KS2-C009 (History and Influence of Design and Technology)
Rationale: Product investigation (C008) and the history and influence of D&T (C009) are explicitly co-taught: C009 carries C008 in its co_teach_hints. Investigating existing products is the practical activity through which historical and cultural context becomes meaningful — studying Brunel's bridges or Dyson's vacuums combines both concepts naturally.
Inspired by: NC DT KS2: investigate and analyse existing products; understand how key events and individuals have shaped the world

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**DT-KS2-D003-CL001:**
- **Evidence and Argument** (primary): What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Investigating existing products requires pupils to gather evidence through disassembly and testing, then build an argument about why the product was designed as it was — evaluation is a structured claim supported by evidence from investigation.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'
- **Stability and Change**: What keeps this stable, what causes change, and how quickly does change happen?
  Why: Studying the history and influence of D&T (Brunel, Dyson) asks pupils to understand why designs changed over time — what made earlier solutions insufficient and what new knowledge or materials enabled a better solution — making this a stability-and-change analysis.
  AI instruction: Use the STABILITY AND CHANGE lens: prompt pupils to identify what conditions keep a system in balance, what disrupts equilibrium, and how change can be gradual or sudden. Useful questions: 'What keeps this the same?', 'What would tip it into change?', 'Is the change reversible?', 'How fast is this changing, and why?'

### Objectives (3)

## Domain: DT-KS2-D004 — Technical Knowledge
**Subject:** Design and Technology | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** knowledge

### Curriculum Context
Technical knowledge at KS2 becomes substantially more complex, building on KS1 structural and mechanical exploration to include electrical systems and computing control. Pupils apply understanding of how to strengthen, stiffen and reinforce complex structures, and learn to use mechanical systems including gears, pulleys, cams, levers and linkages. The introduction of electrical systems - series circuits incorporating switches, bulbs, buzzers and motors - enables pupils to create products with active components. The requirement to apply understanding of computing to program, monitor and control products connects design and technology to the computing curriculum and introduces pupils to the principle of embedded intelligence in designed objects.

### Concepts (3)

#### DT-KS2-C003 — Advanced Mechanical Systems
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Mechanical systems use physical components to transmit, redirect or transform motion and force. At KS2, pupils extend their KS1 knowledge of levers, sliders and wheels to include gears, pulleys, cams and linkages, understanding how these more complex mechanisms change the speed, direction and type of movement in a product. Pupils apply this knowledge by incorporating appropriate mechanisms into their own designed products.

**Teaching guidance:** Use construction kits with gear systems to explore how gear ratios affect speed. Investigate pulley systems to explore how they multiply force. Examine cams of different shapes and how they produce different patterns of movement. Study real products that use these mechanisms - clocks, bicycles, engines. Challenge pupils to design products that require a specific type of movement and to select an appropriate mechanism to achieve it.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may confuse gears of different sizes without understanding that larger gears rotate more slowly than smaller ones when meshed. Hands-on investigation with real gear systems is essential. Pupils may not understand that cams produce different patterns of movement depending on their shape - this requires practical investigation of various cam profiles.

**Key vocabulary:** gear, pulley, cam, linkage, lever, rotation, linear motion, oscillation, gear ratio, input motion, output motion, crank, mechanism

#### DT-KS2-C004 — Electrical Systems and Series Circuits
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 2

Electrical systems use the flow of electrical current through components to produce light, sound, heat or movement. At KS2, pupils learn to design and build series circuits incorporating switches, bulbs, buzzers and motors, understanding how these can be used to add active functionality to a designed product. This concept bridges design and technology with science, as understanding of circuits is developed in both subjects.

**Teaching guidance:** Connect to science circuits work by applying electrical knowledge in DT contexts. Build working series circuits as part of product designs - a lit-up toy, a burglar alarm, a motorised vehicle. Teach pupils to represent circuits using standard circuit symbols and to plan their circuits before building. Investigate the effect of adding more bulbs in series. Discuss how electrical components are incorporated in real products and what safety considerations apply.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may not understand that all components in a series circuit must be connected for current to flow, leading to confusion when a broken circuit does not work. Physical construction of circuits reinforces this concept better than diagrams alone. Pupils may confuse the functions of different output components (bulb gives light, buzzer gives sound, motor gives movement).

**Key vocabulary:** circuit, series, component, switch, bulb, buzzer, motor, battery, current, conductor, insulator, symbol, diagram

#### DT-KS2-C005 — Computing Control in Products
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Computing can be applied to design and technology to create products that sense inputs, process information and control outputs. At KS2, pupils apply their understanding of programming to program, monitor and control their products, using components such as sensors, microcontrollers and actuators. This concept introduces the idea that modern products often contain embedded software that makes them intelligent and responsive.

**Teaching guidance:** Use programmable microcontrollers such as micro:bit, Arduino or similar platforms suited to primary pupils. Set projects where pupils program a device to respond to sensor input - lighting an LED when it gets dark, making a motor stop when a button is pressed. Connect programming tasks to the DT design process - pupils should design what their product will do, then program it to achieve that function. Evaluate how well the program meets the design criteria.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may see computing control as separate from DT rather than as an integrated part of product design. Framing programming tasks as part of the design-make-evaluate cycle maintains this connection. Some pupils may struggle with the abstraction of programming; physical computing with immediate, visible outputs (LEDs, motors) helps make the logic concrete.

**Key vocabulary:** program, control, sensor, actuator, microcontroller, input, output, condition, sequence, monitor, automate, code

These represent the most complex technical knowledge at KS2.
Inspired by: NC DT KS2: understand and use electrical systems; apply understanding of computing to program, monitor and control products

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**DT-KS2-D004-CL001:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Advanced mechanical systems (gears, pulleys, cams) are studied precisely to understand how their structural arrangement — gear ratios, cam profile, pulley configuration — determines the motion output they produce.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Each mechanical system is a cause-and-effect machine: changing the gear ratio changes the output speed and torque in a predictable way, and pupils must understand these causal relationships to design effective mechanisms.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

**DT-KS2-D004-CL002:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Electrical and computer-controlled systems are multi-component systems where input sensors, a controller, and output actuators interact — pupils must model the system as a whole to design a product where all components work together.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Programming a microcontroller to control a circuit requires pupils to reason about the causal chain from sensor input through program logic to actuator output — every program instruction causes a specific, traceable physical effect.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

## Domain: DT-KS2-D005 — Cooking and Nutrition
**Subject:** Design and Technology | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** knowledge

### Curriculum Context
At KS2, the cooking and nutrition domain deepens pupils' knowledge of nutrition and their practical cooking skills. Pupils understand and apply the principles of a healthy and varied diet to make informed food choices, and they prepare and cook a variety of predominantly savoury dishes using a range of cooking techniques. Understanding seasonality is introduced, helping pupils to connect food production to environmental and agricultural cycles and to understand why certain foods are only available at certain times of year. Knowledge of where and how ingredients are grown, reared, caught and processed gives pupils a more complete picture of the food system from production to consumption.

### Concepts (2)

#### DT-KS2-C010 — Cooking Techniques and Food Preparation
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Cooking techniques are the methods used to prepare and transform food ingredients into dishes: chopping, peeling, grating, mixing, boiling, baking, frying, steaming and so on. Each technique requires specific skills and tools and produces different effects on the food in terms of flavour, texture, colour and nutritional content. At KS2, pupils learn a range of predominantly savoury cooking techniques and apply them to prepare dishes that are balanced, nutritious and appropriately presented. Practical cooking competence supports pupils' ability to feed themselves and others a healthy diet.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach cooking techniques progressively, adding complexity as pupils develop competence. Practise knife skills, food hygiene and safety procedures consistently. Connect cooking to design and technology through the design-make-evaluate cycle: plan a dish, cook it, evaluate it. Discuss how different cooking methods affect the same ingredient: what happens to an onion when it is raw, fried, boiled or roasted? Make predominantly savoury dishes to reflect the curriculum emphasis, covering a range of cooking methods across different projects.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may think that only baking counts as cooking, missing the wide range of cooking methods available. Broadening experience across different techniques challenges this assumption. Food hygiene may seem less interesting than cooking itself; making clear connections between specific hygiene practices and specific risks (cross-contamination, bacteria growth) makes the rationale concrete.

**Key vocabulary:** technique, cook, prepare, ingredient, chop, mix, boil, bake, fry, steam, blend, season, hygiene, safety, nutrition, recipe

#### DT-KS2-C011 — Seasonality and Ingredient Sourcing
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Seasonality refers to the natural cycles by which different foods are available at different times of year. Seasonal ingredients are typically fresher, more nutritious, more economical and have a lower environmental impact because they require less energy-intensive production or long-distance transport. Understanding where and how ingredients are grown, reared, caught and processed — from field to fork — connects pupils to the food system and to issues of environmental and social sustainability in food production.

**Teaching guidance:** Create a seasonal food calendar with pupils, investigating when different fruits and vegetables are in season in the UK. Compare seasonal and out-of-season produce in terms of cost, flavour and food miles. Investigate a food product from shop shelf back to its origin: where was it grown, how was it transported, what processes did it go through? Visit a farm, market or food producer if possible. Cook seasonal dishes using locally sourced ingredients to demonstrate seasonal eating in practice. Connect to science through plant growth cycles and geography through food trade routes.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may not realise that many supermarket products are available year-round because they are imported from other countries or grown in heated greenhouses, both of which have environmental costs. Pupils may equate 'imported' with 'worse' without understanding the complex trade-offs involved; nuanced discussion is more valuable than simple judgements.

**Key vocabulary:** season, seasonal, local, imported, food miles, grow, rear, catch, process, harvest, origin, supply chain, sustainability, fresh, organic

Type: practice
Concepts: DT-KS2-C010 (Cooking Techniques and Food Preparation), DT-KS2-C011 (Seasonality and Ingredient Sourcing)
Rationale: Cooking techniques (C010) and seasonality/ingredient sourcing (C011) are explicitly co-taught: C011 carries C010 in its co_teach_hints. Practical cooking lessons at KS2 naturally incorporate discussion of where ingredients come from and why seasonal choices matter, integrating both concepts.

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**DT-KS2-D005-CL001:**
- **Cause and Effect** (primary): What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Cooking techniques work through specific physical and chemical transformations — heat causes proteins to denature, acid causes pastry to become flaky — and pupils must understand these causal processes to select and apply techniques correctly.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'
- **Systems and System Models**: What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Seasonality and sourcing requires pupils to model the food supply system: understanding how growing season, geography and supply chain decisions determine ingredient availability and quality positions food choices within a larger system.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'

## Domain: CO-KS12-D002 — Computer Science: Algorithms and Programming (KS2)
**Subject:** Computing | **Key Stage:** KS1 | **Age:** 5-11 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
At KS2, programming develops substantially in sophistication, moving from simple sequences to programs that use the fundamental control structures of computer science: sequence (instructions in order), selection (if-then-else decisions) and repetition (loops). The addition of variables - named storage locations that can hold and change values - enables much more powerful programs. Decomposition (breaking a problem into smaller, manageable parts) is introduced as a strategy for tackling complex programming challenges. The requirement to use logical reasoning to explain how algorithms work develops pupils' ability to analyse and communicate about code, not just to write it. Working with multiple programming languages, including at least one text-based language, broadens pupils' experience of how programming concepts are realised in different syntactic forms.

### Concepts (3)

#### CO-KS12-C001 — Algorithms **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 1 | Teaching weight: 1 | Fan-out: 3

An algorithm is a precise, unambiguous sequence of instructions for solving a problem or accomplishing a task. Algorithms are more general than programs: an algorithm describes what needs to be done, while a program is a specific implementation of an algorithm in a particular programming language. Algorithms must be correct (they produce the right output), precise (each step is unambiguous), and finite (they eventually reach a conclusion). At KS1 and KS2, pupils learn to write and recognise algorithms, understand their properties, and implement them as programs.

**Teaching guidance:** Begin with unplugged algorithm activities before moving to digital programming. Teach pupils to write step-by-step instructions for everyday tasks (making a sandwich, brushing teeth) to illustrate the precision required in algorithms. Use robot or turtle-following activities where pupils give instructions and observe the results of ambiguity or incorrect ordering. Discuss what happens when an algorithm has an error: the program does what we said, not what we meant. Introduce the idea of testing algorithms with different inputs to check they work in all cases.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may think that an algorithm is the same as a program; clarifying that an algorithm is the idea or plan, while a program is the specific coded implementation, is important. Pupils may not appreciate that algorithms need to be unambiguous; activities where deliberately ambiguous instructions lead to unexpected results make this vivid. The idea that a computer does exactly what it is told, rather than what we intended, is a fundamental shift in thinking that needs explicit attention.

**Key vocabulary:** algorithm, instruction, sequence, step, precise, unambiguous, input, output, process, program, implement, order, correct, test, debug

#### CO-KS12-C002 — Programming: Sequence, Selection and Repetition
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 2

All programs are built from three fundamental control structures: sequence (instructions executed in order, one after another), selection (conditional branches where different instructions execute depending on a condition - if/then/else) and repetition (loops where instructions repeat a specified number of times or while a condition holds). These three structures are sufficient to express any computable algorithm, and mastery of them is the core of programming competence. At KS2, pupils learn to use all three structures in their programs, developing increasingly sophisticated and efficient code.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce each control structure separately before combining them. Use visual block-based programming environments (Scratch, Blockly) initially to reduce syntax barriers. Progress to text-based languages at upper KS2 to develop more precise understanding of programming syntax. Always connect programming tasks to a genuine purpose: a game, an animation, a simulation. Teach debugging systematically: read the code line by line, trace the execution, identify where actual behaviour diverges from expected behaviour. Celebrate debugging success as much as successful first attempts.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often use loops incorrectly, either not using them when repetition is present (writing the same instruction multiple times) or using them in inappropriate contexts. Explicit comparison of repetitive code versus loop code makes the efficiency benefit clear. Selection (if/then/else) is conceptually more demanding; pupils may write conditions that cannot be true, or miss the else case. Tracing through conditional code step by step makes the logic visible.

**Key vocabulary:** sequence, selection, repetition, loop, conditional, if, then, else, while, for, variable, input, output, debug, program, code, execute, trace

#### CO-KS12-C006 — Decomposition and Computational Thinking
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Computational thinking is a set of problem-solving approaches that involve breaking problems down (decomposition), identifying patterns (pattern recognition), focusing on the most relevant information (abstraction) and developing step-by-step solutions (algorithm design). Decomposition - breaking a complex problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems - is particularly important in programming, as it enables pupils to tackle problems that would otherwise be too large to address as a whole. At KS2, pupils apply decomposition to design programs and to plan complex digital projects.

**Teaching guidance:** Model decomposition explicitly when setting programming tasks: show how a complex program can be broken into components (an animation with a background, a character, sound, score). Ask pupils to plan their program structure before coding. Teach the use of procedures and functions as a way of organising decomposed code. Practice decomposition in non-computing contexts: planning an event, organising a research project. Connect decomposition to the design stage of the design-make-evaluate cycle. Use flowcharts and pseudocode to represent decomposed algorithms before implementing them.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may attempt to solve programming challenges as a single, undivided problem rather than decomposing them. Modelling the decomposition process explicitly, and requiring pupils to plan before coding, develops this habit. Abstraction (ignoring irrelevant detail) can be conceptually challenging; concrete examples of what to include and what to leave out in specific contexts help. Pupils may not see the connection between computational thinking and problem-solving in other domains; deliberate cross-curricular examples broaden the concept.

**Key vocabulary:** decomposition, computational thinking, abstraction, pattern recognition, algorithm, problem-solving, sub-problem, procedure, function, modular, plan, flowchart, pseudocode, design

Type: introduction
Concepts: CO-KS12-C001 (Algorithms), CO-KS12-C006 (Decomposition and Computational Thinking)
Rationale: Algorithms and decomposition/computational thinking are tightly co-taught at KS2: understanding what an algorithm is (C001) is the prerequisite for decomposing problems into algorithms (C006), and C006 lists C001 in its co_teach_hints. Together they form the conceptual foundation before programming practice.

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**CO-KS12-D002-CL001:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Decomposition requires pupils to model a complex problem as a system of smaller interacting parts — understanding that the whole can be broken into components that each perform a defined function is a systems-thinking act.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Algorithms are fundamentally repeatable patterns of instruction; recognising that the same problem type can be solved with the same algorithmic pattern is the key generalisation pupils must form at this stage.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**CO-KS12-D002-CL002:**
- **Cause and Effect** (primary): What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Writing and debugging programs with sequence, selection and repetition demands that pupils predict the effect of each control structure — tracing how changing a condition in a selection statement changes what the program does is a direct cause-and-effect analysis.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: The three control structures are themselves patterns of execution; pupils must recognise which structural pattern (loop, branch, sequence) is the right template for a given problem, applying pattern recognition to programming design choices.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

### Objectives (3)
- CO-KS12-O007 [statutory]: design, write and debug programs that accomplish specific goals, including controlling or simulating physical systems; solve problems by decomposing them into smaller parts

## Domain: CO-KS12-D004 — Digital Literacy and IT Skills (KS2)
**Subject:** Computing | **Key Stage:** KS1 | **Age:** 5-11 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
Digital literacy at KS2 develops from practical creation skills to include understanding of the digital infrastructure that makes communication and collaboration possible. Pupils learn how computer networks work, how the internet connects networks globally, and how communication over the internet works. Critically, pupils develop understanding of how search technologies work and how results are ranked, which is essential for developing the critical evaluation skills needed to use internet resources effectively and safely. The expansion of software skills to include selecting and combining multiple applications develops the technological versatility and problem-solving mindset of confident digital users. Online safety at KS2 becomes more sophisticated, addressing issues of personal information, digital footprints, cyberbullying and evaluating online content.

### Concepts (1)

#### CO-KS12-C004 — Networks, the Internet and the World Wide Web
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

A computer network is a collection of computing devices connected together to share data and resources. The internet is the global network of networks, connecting millions of devices worldwide using a common set of protocols. The World Wide Web is a service built on the internet, comprising web pages accessed via browsers. Email, messaging and streaming are other internet services. At KS2, pupils develop conceptual understanding of how networks and the internet work, distinguishing between physical infrastructure and the services that run on top of it.

**Teaching guidance:** Use diagrams to show how devices are connected in a local network and how local networks connect via the internet. Discuss the difference between the internet (the physical and logical infrastructure) and the web (a service accessed via the internet). Explore how data travels across the internet in packets. Investigate the role of search engines and how they index and rank pages. Connect to digital safety: understanding how the internet works underpins understanding of online privacy and data. Use analogies: the postal system as an analogy for internet protocols.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often confuse the internet with the World Wide Web, using the terms interchangeably. Establishing that the web is one service on the internet (alongside email, streaming etc.) is a key conceptual correction. Pupils may think the internet is a physical 'place' rather than a network of connected devices; using physical metaphors (roads, postal networks) helps make the infrastructure tangible. The idea that data travels in packets, potentially by different routes, is counterintuitive to many pupils.

**Key vocabulary:** network, internet, World Wide Web, website, browser, server, router, packet, protocol, IP address, search engine, hyperlink, URL, data, bandwidth

### ConceptClusters (1)

**CO-KS12-D004-CL001** — Understand computer networks and use search technologies critically [CURATED]
Type: practice
Concepts: CO-KS12-C004 (Networks, the Internet and the World Wide Web)
Rationale: Networks and the Internet is the sole concept in the KS2 digital literacy domain, covering both the infrastructure of the internet and the digital literacy skill of evaluating search results. A single precise cluster correctly covers the domain.
Inspired by: NC Computing KS2: understand computer networks including the internet

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**CO-KS12-D004-CL001:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Understanding the internet as a network requires pupils to model how devices, routers and servers interact as a system — each component has a role and the system's behaviour emerges from how the parts communicate.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Evidence and Argument**: What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Evaluating search results critically requires pupils to assess the quality and reliability of evidence — deciding whether a source is trustworthy is an argument-evaluation task grounded in evidence appraisal.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'

### Objectives (4)
- CO-KS12-O010 [statutory]: understand computer networks including the internet; how they can provide multiple services, such as the world wide web; and the opportunities they offer for communication and collaboration
- CO-KS12-O011 [statutory]: use search technologies effectively, appreciate how results are selected and ranked, and be discerning in evaluating digital content
- CO-KS12-O012 [statutory]: select, use and combine a variety of software (including internet services) on a range of digital devices to design and create a range of programs, systems and content that accomplish given goals

## Domain: LA-KS2-D001 — Listening and Speaking
**Subject:** Languages | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
Oral language skills form the foundation of language acquisition, and the primary languages curriculum gives listening and speaking particular prominence at KS2. Pupils must listen attentively to authentic spoken language and respond appropriately, developing the ability to tolerate ambiguity and extract meaning even when not every word is understood. Exploring patterns and sounds through songs and rhymes is not merely motivational but develops phonological awareness of the new language's sound system, which differs from English in pitch, rhythm, stress and specific phonemes. The specification that pupils should speak with accurate pronunciation and intonation from the outset establishes high expectations: being understood in a foreign language requires phonological precision that must be developed through consistent feedback and modelling.

### Concepts (2)

#### LA-KS2-C001 — Phonology and Pronunciation **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: skill | Complexity: 1 | Teaching weight: 1 | Fan-out: 3

Each language has a distinctive phonological system: the set of sounds (phonemes) it uses, the rules for combining them, and the patterns of stress and intonation that give spoken language its characteristic sound. Learning a foreign language requires developing a new phonological awareness that may include sounds not present in English, different stress patterns and different intonation contours. At KS2, systematic attention to pronunciation from the earliest stages prevents the fossilisation of incorrect patterns and develops the phonological foundation for authentic spoken communication.

**Teaching guidance:** Use songs, rhymes and chants to introduce and practise the sound system of the target language. Model pronunciation precisely and ask pupils to echo-repeat. Use minimal pairs (words that differ by one sound) to develop discrimination of similar sounds. Record pupils speaking and play back so they can hear their own pronunciation. Teach the specific sounds of the target language that differ from English (nasal vowels in French, the rolled r in Spanish). Connect spelling to sound regularly: what does this letter combination sound like in this language? Use phonics-style activities adapted for the target language.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may assume that letters in the target language are pronounced as in English. Systematic attention to differences in sound-spelling correspondence prevents fossilisation of incorrect patterns. Some pupils may feel embarrassed to make unfamiliar sounds; creating a playful, low-stakes environment for sound exploration reduces inhibition. Teachers may unconsciously accept poor pronunciation as adequate; consistently modelling and expecting accurate pronunciation maintains high standards.

**Key vocabulary:** pronunciation, intonation, stress, phoneme, sound, syllable, rhythm, accent, tone, vowel, consonant, nasal, rolling, liaison, elision

#### LA-KS2-C004 — Communicative Competence
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Communicative competence is the ability to use language effectively in real communicative situations, combining linguistic accuracy with the social and cultural knowledge needed to communicate appropriately in different contexts. It encompasses grammatical competence (correct forms), sociolinguistic competence (appropriate register and context), discourse competence (organising longer stretches of language coherently) and strategic competence (managing communication despite gaps in knowledge). At KS2, pupils begin to develop communicative competence through structured interaction, role-play and authentic communication tasks.

**Teaching guidance:** Design tasks that require genuine communication: information gaps, problem-solving activities, surveys. Use role-play scenarios that develop contextually appropriate language (shopping, asking directions, at a restaurant). Develop pupils' ability to manage communication difficulties: use of circumlocution, asking for clarification, using cognates. Encourage pupils to take communicative risks and reward successful communication even when grammatically imperfect. Connect language learning to cultural awareness: how do greetings, politeness conventions and social norms differ in the target language culture?

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may believe that making a grammatical error means they have failed to communicate. Distinguishing between grammatical accuracy and communicative success, and valuing both, develops more confident communicators. Some pupils are reluctant to speak without certainty of accuracy; developing tolerance of ambiguity and risk-taking in communication is important. Pupils may see languages as sets of rules to be memorised rather than tools for communication; keeping the communicative purpose central prevents this.

**Key vocabulary:** communicate, conversation, question, answer, response, opinion, clarify, understand, explain, describe, interact, context, appropriate, fluent, confident

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**LA-KS2-D001-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Phonology and pronunciation in a foreign language is built on recognising and internalising the sound patterns of the target language — pupils must perceive and reproduce the phonemic patterns that differ from English.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Perspective and Interpretation**: Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?
  Why: Communicative competence requires pupils to adapt their language to the listener's needs and the conversational context — a perspective-taking skill that goes beyond accuracy to encompass appropriacy and audience awareness.
  AI instruction: Use the PERSPECTIVE AND INTERPRETATION lens: prompt pupils to identify the author's or actor's viewpoint, consider what information or experience shapes that perspective, look for omissions or contradictions, and compare multiple accounts. Useful questions: 'Who wrote/said this, and why?', 'What might they have left out?', 'How would someone else see this differently?', 'What would change your view?'

## Domain: LA-KS2-D002 — Reading
**Subject:** Languages | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
Reading in a foreign language at KS2 connects oral language acquisition to the written form, supporting pupils in making connections between sounds and their written representations. Pupils are expected to read carefully, bringing to bear the phonic awareness developed through listening and speaking. The requirement to appreciate stories, songs, poems and rhymes in the language introduces pupils to authentic literary and cultural texts, developing cultural awareness alongside language skills. Developing the ability to understand unfamiliar words through context is a key metacognitive strategy that enables learners to operate with increasing independence, rather than depending on translation for every unknown word.

### Concepts (1)

#### LA-KS2-C006 — Reading in the Target Language
Type: skill | Complexity: 1 | Teaching weight: 1 | Fan-out: 1

Reading in a foreign language requires pupils to decode written text using their phonological knowledge of the target language's sound-spelling correspondences, while simultaneously applying vocabulary and grammatical knowledge to construct meaning. At KS2, pupils develop the ability to read words, phrases and simple texts in the target language with careful attention to meaning, making use of context and dictionaries to resolve unfamiliar vocabulary. Engagement with stories, songs, poems and rhymes in the written form of the target language develops both decoding skill and cultural engagement, as pupils encounter the imaginative and literary traditions of the target language community.

**Teaching guidance:** Connect reading to the oral language pupils have already encountered: what they can say, they should be able to read. Build reading from familiar phrases and vocabulary before introducing unfamiliar written material. Use shared reading of simple texts with visual support (images, diagrams) to develop reading for meaning. Teach dictionary use as a strategy for resolving unfamiliar vocabulary, including the skill of identifying headwords and selecting the correct meaning from multiple options. Engage pupils with songs, poems and simple stories in the target language as authentic reading material that is motivating and culturally rich. Develop the ability to read aloud with accurate pronunciation, connecting spelling to sound in the target language.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may attempt to read target language text using English sound-spelling correspondences, producing systematic mispronunciation. Consistent phonics-based teaching of the target language's sound system prevents this. Some pupils may believe that understanding every word is necessary before any meaning can be extracted; teaching reading for gist and the use of context to infer meaning develops more effective reading strategies. Dictionary use may be seen as admitting failure rather than as a competent reading strategy; normalising dictionary use as a skilled behaviour encourages its effective application.

**Key vocabulary:** read, text, word, phrase, sentence, meaning, understand, dictionary, vocabulary, story, poem, song, rhyme, decode, pronunciation, spelling

**LA-KS2-D002-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Decoding written text in a foreign language requires pupils to recognise the grapheme-phoneme correspondence patterns of the target language — mapping written symbols to sounds follows pattern recognition rather than rule application at this stage.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Perspective and Interpretation**: Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?
  Why: Reading comprehension involves inferring meaning from context and understanding the writer's purpose, both of which require pupils to interpret text from the perspective of a reader navigating an unfamiliar language system.

## Domain: LA-KS2-D003 — Writing
**Subject:** Languages | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
Writing in a foreign language at KS2 develops through the adaptation and creation of phrases rather than free composition. Pupils begin by writing phrases from memory - demonstrating that they can reproduce language without copying - and progress to adapting learned phrases to create new sentences, demonstrating productive competence rather than merely reproductive ability. The requirement to describe people, places, things and actions across a range of contexts ensures that writing develops in breadth. Understanding and applying basic grammar - including feminine, masculine and neuter forms, the conjugation of high-frequency verbs, key features of sentence structure, and the use of conjunctions to extend sentences - develops the structural understanding that enables creative language use beyond set phrases.

Writing in a foreign language at KS2 begins with reproducing and adapting learned phrases, developing pupils' ability to express ideas in the written form of the target language without copying from a visual prompt. Starting with phrases from memory demonstrates that language has been internalised, not merely copied. Adapting learned phrases to create new sentences is a crucial step towards productive competence: pupils apply their grammatical knowledge (of gender, verb forms, word order) to create language beyond the specific examples they have been taught. Describing people, places, things and actions across a range of topics develops the breadth of written productive ability.

**Teaching guidance:** Scaffold the progression from copying to independent writing carefully: begin with supported writing frames, move to partially completed sentences, then to writing from memory prompts, then to unprompted writing. Teach pupils to check their writing for accuracy: does the adjective agree with the noun? Is the verb conjugated correctly? Is the word order correct? Use writing as consolidation after oral practice: what pupils can say, they should be able to write. Develop pupils' use of a bilingual dictionary or glossary for self-checking rather than for word-by-word translation. Celebrate writing as a means of communication: display and share what pupils write, and where possible use writing for real communicative purposes (pen pal letters, class books, display captions).

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may produce writing by copying from classroom displays or books rather than from memory; building in activities that require independent recall (covering the model before writing) develops genuine productive competence. Pupils may view written accuracy as the only criterion for good writing; developing the ability to communicate meaning effectively even with some errors alongside developing accuracy produces more confident writers. Some pupils may feel that they cannot write in a foreign language; scaffolded, achievable writing tasks with clear success criteria build confidence before demanding more extended production.

**Key vocabulary:** write, phrase, sentence, describe, adapt, create, express, memory, idea, topic, people, place, action, accurate, check, grammar

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**LA-KS2-D003-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Adapting learned phrases to new contexts depends on recognising the structural patterns underlying those phrases — noticing that a greeting pattern, a colour agreement, or a number pattern can be recombined to produce new sentences.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Correct spelling in a foreign language is governed by phoneme-grapheme rules where making the wrong choice causes an intelligibility or accuracy failure — pupils must understand how each spelling decision affects the written form produced.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

### Objectives (2)

## Domain: LA-KS2-D004 — Grammar and Vocabulary
**Subject:** Languages | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** knowledge

### Curriculum Context
Grammar and vocabulary are the structural and lexical building blocks of language proficiency. At KS2, pupils develop understanding of key grammatical features of the target language, which typically differ substantially from English: grammatical gender (feminine, masculine, neuter), number (singular and plural), case (where relevant), verb conjugation and sentence structure. This grammatical knowledge is not taught for its own sake but to enable pupils to communicate with greater accuracy and flexibility. Vocabulary development is equally important: a broad vocabulary spanning personal, social, environmental and cultural domains provides the lexical resources for authentic communication. Developing the habit of learning new vocabulary systematically, and strategies for remembering and using it, is as important as the specific vocabulary learned.

### Concepts (3)

#### LA-KS2-C002 — Vocabulary Acquisition and Use **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 1 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 4

Vocabulary is the core building material of language: without words, grammar cannot operate and communication is impossible. Effective vocabulary acquisition involves encountering new words in context, understanding their meaning, form and use, practising them in a variety of ways, and storing them in long-term memory for retrieval in communication. At KS2, pupils build a working vocabulary across a range of topics (personal information, family, school, food, animals, weather, place and time), developing both receptive vocabulary (words recognised when heard or read) and productive vocabulary (words actively used in speaking and writing).

**Teaching guidance:** Teach vocabulary in meaningful chunks (phrases, sentences, contexts) rather than isolated word lists. Use multiple modalities for vocabulary practice: hear it, say it, read it, write it, act it out. Introduce vocabulary in manageable sets and revise regularly using spaced practice. Use picture flashcards, word games, memory techniques (association, visualisation) and word maps. Connect new vocabulary to words pupils already know in English or other languages. Teach pupils to use dictionaries and simple vocabulary lists independently. Develop pupils' awareness of patterns in vocabulary across the language.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may believe that learning vocabulary means translating word lists. Teaching vocabulary in context and through use challenges this. Pupils may not use deliberate strategies to memorise vocabulary; teaching a range of memory techniques (visual associations, spaced practice, self-testing) develops more effective vocabulary learning habits. The distinction between receptive and productive vocabulary is important: recognising a word when heard is different from being able to use it spontaneously.

**Key vocabulary:** vocabulary, word, phrase, meaning, context, translate, dictionary, category, topic, receptive, productive, revise, memorise, association, cognate

#### LA-KS2-C003 — Grammar: Gender, Number and Verb Conjugation **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 3

Many languages assign grammatical gender to nouns (masculine, feminine, and in some languages neuter), which affects the form of articles, adjectives and pronouns that accompany them. Number (singular and plural) affects verb and noun forms. Verb conjugation refers to the way verbs change their form depending on the subject (person and number). These grammatical structures are fundamental to producing grammatically correct speech and writing in most European languages. At KS2, pupils develop understanding of these features and learn to apply them in the context of the language being studied.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach grammatical gender systematically from the first introduction of nouns: always introduce a noun with its article (le chat, la maison). Use colour-coding to help pupils distinguish masculine and feminine. Provide extensive practice of high-frequency verbs (to be, to have, to go, to want, to like) in all their conjugated forms. Highlight patterns within paradigms: verbs that share endings, nouns that share gender markers. Connect grammar to communication: knowing that adjectives agree with nouns enables pupils to describe things accurately. Use grammatical metalanguage (gender, conjugate, plural) from the start.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils accustomed to English may not understand why nouns have gender in other languages. Explaining that grammatical gender is a linguistic feature, not a reflection of real-world gender, prevents confusion. Pupils may not see the relevance of learning verb conjugation; connecting it to the ability to talk about different people (I, you, he, she) makes the functional purpose clear. Irregular verbs (which are often the most common) require extra attention; pupils may apply regular patterns to irregular forms.

**Key vocabulary:** gender, masculine, feminine, neuter, singular, plural, article, noun, verb, conjugate, subject, agree, tense, person, form

#### LA-KS2-C005 — Language Awareness and Transfer
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Language awareness refers to an explicit understanding of how languages work as systems, including how the target language is similar to and different from English and from other languages the pupil may know. This metalinguistic awareness supports language learning in multiple ways: it helps pupils to identify cognates (words similar across languages), to apply understanding of grammatical categories across languages, and to develop strategies for tackling unfamiliar language. Language transfer - applying knowledge from one language to another - can both facilitate learning (positive transfer) and cause errors (negative transfer or interference).

**Teaching guidance:** Regularly draw attention to similarities and differences between the target language and English. Explore cognates: words that are similar in form and meaning. Discuss how the grammatical concepts introduced in the target language (gender, verb conjugation, case) relate to or differ from English. Use linguistic metalanguage consistently: verb, noun, adjective, sentence, tense. Develop pupils' awareness of their own language learning processes: what strategies work for them? Encourage pupils who speak other languages to share how their languages compare. Connect to English grammar teaching to develop integrated understanding.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may assume that the target language works like English in all respects. Drawing attention to systematic differences prevents negative transfer errors. Pupils may see cognates as confusing rather than helpful; teaching that cognates are a resource for decoding unfamiliar text develops a positive strategy. Pupils who speak languages other than English at home may have significant knowledge that is not recognised or drawn upon; making space for multilingual comparison enriches the learning of all pupils.

**Key vocabulary:** language, similar, different, compare, cognate, translate, pattern, structure, metalanguage, transfer, strategy, bilingual, multilingual, grammar, system

Rationale: Language awareness and transfer (C005) co-teaches with both C002 and C003 and represents a higher-order metacognitive concept: pupils reflect on how the target language relates to English and other known languages. This is taught after and alongside vocabulary and grammar, making it a distinct practice cluster.
Inspired by: MFL KS2: note the patterns and rules that emerge

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**LA-KS2-D004-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Grammar acquisition is fundamentally about internalising the patterns that govern word order, agreement and inflection — pupils must recognise that the same grammatical pattern applies across many different vocabulary items.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Systems and System Models**: What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Vocabulary and grammar together form a generative system: a finite set of words and rules combines to produce an infinite range of utterances, and pupils must begin to model this system to use the language productively.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'

**LA-KS2-D004-CL002:**
- **Perspective and Interpretation** (primary): Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?
  Why: Language awareness requires pupils to step outside their first language and observe both languages as systems from a metalinguistic perspective — noticing similarities and differences in structure is an interpretive act that requires shifting viewpoint.
  AI instruction: Use the PERSPECTIVE AND INTERPRETATION lens: prompt pupils to identify the author's or actor's viewpoint, consider what information or experience shapes that perspective, look for omissions or contradictions, and compare multiple accounts. Useful questions: 'Who wrote/said this, and why?', 'What might they have left out?', 'How would someone else see this differently?', 'What would change your view?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Transfer between languages is enabled by recognising shared patterns — cognates, parallel grammatical structures, or borrowed vocabulary — so pattern recognition across language systems is the cognitive mechanism that makes transfer possible.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

### Objectives (1)
- LA-KS2-O012 [statutory]: understand basic grammar appropriate to the language being studied, including (where relevant): feminine, masculine and neuter forms and the conjugation of high-frequency verbs; key features and patterns of the language; how to apply these, for instance, to build sentences; and how these differ from or are similar to English

## Domain: PE-KS1-D001 — Physical Skills and Movement
**Subject:** Physical Education | **Key Stage:** KS1 | **Age:** 5-7 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
The foundation of KS1 physical education is the development of fundamental movement skills that underpin all subsequent physical activity. The curriculum specifies mastery of running, jumping, throwing and catching as core skills alongside balance, agility and co-ordination, which together form the physical literacy framework that enables pupils to participate confidently in a wide range of activities. The word 'master' is significant: it implies that pupils should develop genuine competence and fluency rather than merely being introduced to these skills. The application of basic skills across a range of activities ensures that learning transfers beyond single-sport contexts, building the physical confidence and versatility that supports lifelong physical activity.

### Concepts (2)

#### PE-KS1-C001 — Fundamental Movement Skills
Type: skill | Complexity: 1 | Teaching weight: 1 | Fan-out: 2

Fundamental movement skills are the foundational physical competencies that underpin participation in all sports and physical activities. Running, jumping, throwing and catching are the four primary fundamental movement skills specified at KS1; together with balance, agility and co-ordination, they constitute the physical literacy framework. Mastery of these skills in isolation and in combination is the prerequisite for confident, versatile physical participation across the full range of activities in the physical education curriculum.

**Teaching guidance:** Use a range of activities that require each fundamental skill in isolation before combining them. For running: vary pace, direction and pathways; use relay and chasing games. For jumping: explore different take-offs and landings; horizontal and vertical jumps. For throwing and catching: vary distances, sizes of object, and types of throw (underarm, overarm, roll). Develop balance through gymnastics balances and yoga-style holds. Build agility through obstacle courses, tag games and direction-change activities. Use rhythmic activities to develop coordination. Record and celebrate pupils' improving competence over time.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may believe that physical skill is innate rather than developed through practice. Consistent messaging that all skills can be improved with practice and effort develops a physical growth mindset. Some pupils may have significant developmental differences in motor skills; scaffolding and differentiated tasks ensure all pupils can access and progress. Teachers may focus on the most physically able pupils; deliberate attention to the full range of ability ensures inclusive progress.

**Key vocabulary:** run, jump, throw, catch, balance, agility, co-ordination, hop, skip, leap, underarm, overarm, receive, travel, direction, pace

#### PE-KS1-C005 — Physical Health and Fitness
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 1 | Teaching weight: 1

Physical education makes a critical contribution to pupils' physical health and wellbeing by developing the habit of regular physical activity and an understanding of its effects on the body. At KS1, pupils begin to understand the relationship between physical activity and health, noticing how their bodies change during exercise and beginning to understand why physical activity is important for overall health and wellbeing. This lays the foundation for the more detailed understanding of fitness and health developed at KS2 and beyond.

**Teaching guidance:** Build awareness of physical changes during exercise: breathing rate, heart rate, temperature, tiredness. Discuss why physical activity is good for bodies: strength, flexibility, stamina, heart health. Use simple warm-up and cool-down routines to develop understanding of preparation for and recovery from physical activity. Make connections to healthy lifestyle habits: sleep, nutrition and physical activity as interconnected. Keep the emphasis on enjoyment of physical activity so that positive associations are established early.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may equate physical activity with formal sport or competition, missing the broad range of physical activities that contribute to health. Teaching that walking, playing and dancing all count helps broaden pupils' concept of physical activity. Some pupils may have negative associations with physical exertion; connecting physical sensations to positive outcomes (feeling energised, improving at a skill) helps develop positive relationships with physical effort.

**Key vocabulary:** healthy, exercise, fitness, heart rate, breathing, warm up, cool down, strength, stamina, flexibility, energy, active, wellbeing, body

Rationale: Fundamental Movement Skills (C001) and Physical Health and Fitness (C005) are naturally co-taught at KS1: movement skill activities are the primary vehicle through which pupils develop health and fitness understanding — noticing changes in heart rate, breathing and energy during physical activity. Separating them would artificially divide what is experienced as unified physical education.

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**PE-KS1-D001-CL001:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Fundamental movement skills are body structures (running patterns, jumping mechanics, throwing technique) whose correct form determines their function — efficient, safe and powerful movement; even KS1 pupils notice that how you do something changes what you can do.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Physical Health and Fitness (C005) is taught through noticing bodily cause-and-effect relationships — changes in heart rate, breathing and energy during physical activity — making this a first introduction to the body as a responsive physical system.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

## Domain: PE-KS1-D002 — Games and Team Activities
**Subject:** Physical Education | **Key Stage:** KS1 | **Age:** 5-7 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
Team games introduce pupils to the social and strategic dimensions of physical activity at KS1. Pupils not only participate in games but are expected to develop simple tactics for attacking and defending, which requires them to think about the game strategically as well as execute physical skills. This domain develops communication, cooperation and decision-making within physical contexts, teaching pupils to work effectively with others towards shared goals. The introduction of attacking and defending as conceptual frameworks gives pupils a vocabulary for thinking about game strategy that will be extended and refined throughout their physical education.

### Concepts (1)

#### PE-KS1-C002 — Game Tactics and Strategy
Type: skill | Complexity: 1 | Teaching weight: 1

Tactics in games involve making decisions about what to do and when, in order to gain advantage over opponents or to create scoring opportunities. At KS1, pupils develop simple tactical understanding within small-sided games, learning the basic concepts of attacking (trying to score or gain advantage) and defending (trying to prevent the opposition from scoring). Tactical thinking requires pupils to read the game situation, make decisions quickly and adapt their movement accordingly.

**Teaching guidance:** Use small-sided games with simple rules so that tactical decisions are visible and manageable. Start with one-versus-one situations to make attacking and defending clear. Ask pupils questions during and after games: 'What did you do to get past your opponent?' 'Where was the best place to move to?' Use freeze-frame moments to discuss tactical options. Gradually increase the complexity of games as pupils develop tactical understanding. Connect tactical language to real decisions in game contexts rather than teaching it abstractly.

**Common misconceptions:** Young pupils often focus on the ball and chase it regardless of position, making games chaotic. Teaching about space - both finding and creating it - develops more sophisticated game play. Pupils may not understand the value of passing; small games where passing is rewarded help develop this understanding. Some pupils confuse individual skill with team success; cooperative games build understanding that effective teamwork can outperform individual talent.

**Key vocabulary:** attack, defend, score, opponent, team, tactics, strategy, space, position, pass, intercept, guard, mark, goal, target

**PE-KS1-D002-CL001:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Even simple team games are systems in which attacking and defending roles interact dynamically — understanding that your team's movement changes the space available to the opposition is a first encounter with systems thinking in a physical context.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Tactical decision-making at KS1 is fundamentally about cause and effect: if I pass here, what happens? If they move left, what space opens? Pupils learn to anticipate consequential chains of action and response.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

## Domain: PE-KS1-D003 — Dance
**Subject:** Physical Education | **Key Stage:** KS1 | **Age:** 5-7 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
Dance at KS1 introduces pupils to the expressive and aesthetic dimensions of physical education, connecting movement to music, rhythm and creative expression. Pupils perform dances using simple movement patterns, which develops their ability to reproduce sequences of movement from memory, to coordinate their body to musical rhythms, and to use their body as a means of creative and expressive communication. Dance develops spatial awareness, body coordination and musicality alongside physical fitness, and provides an important counterpoint to games and athletics in the physical education curriculum. The requirement to use simple movement patterns ensures that dance work is accessible and achievable at this stage while still developing genuine physical and expressive skill.

### Concepts (1)

#### PE-KS1-C003 — Expressive Movement and Dance
Type: skill | Complexity: 1 | Teaching weight: 1 | Fan-out: 1

Dance in physical education develops pupils' ability to use their bodies expressively to communicate ideas, stories, moods and characters through movement. At KS1, pupils work with simple movement patterns, developing the ability to remember and reproduce sequences of movement, to coordinate their movement to music and rhythm, and to use their bodies with creative intention. Dance develops body awareness, spatial awareness, coordination and musicality alongside physical fitness.

**Teaching guidance:** Use a variety of stimuli for dance: music, stories, natural phenomena (weather, animals), themes and emotions. Teach specific movement vocabulary: stretching, curling, twisting, turning, travelling, jumping, stillness. Build simple sequences by combining a small number of actions. Use mirroring and copying activities to develop movement observation and reproduction. Encourage pupils to explore and choose their own movement responses within structured frameworks. Perform to each other to develop confidence and the experience of communicating through movement.

**Common misconceptions:** Some pupils (particularly boys) may resist dance activities. Framing dance as physical skill development and using stimuli with broad appeal addresses this cultural barrier. Pupils may believe there is one correct way to move; open-ended tasks that reward diverse responses develop creative confidence. Pupils may focus on steps rather than expression; teaching that dance communicates something develops more intentional and expressive performance.

**Key vocabulary:** movement, pattern, sequence, expression, rhythm, travel, jump, turn, gesture, stillness, shape, level, direction, body part, tempo

- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: KS1 dance is built on movement patterns — sequences reproduced from memory, repeated rhythmic motifs, mirroring — making pattern recognition and replication the central physical and cognitive demand.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Structure and Function**: How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Performing movement expressively requires pupils to understand that how a movement is performed (its quality, size, direction) changes what it communicates — the body's structural choices serve expressive functions.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'

## Domain: PE-KS1-D004 — Swimming and Water Safety
**Subject:** Physical Education | **Key Stage:** KS1 | **Age:** 5-7 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
The National Curriculum requires that all pupils should be able to swim competently by the end of KS2, and schools may choose to teach swimming during KS1 to meet this requirement. The programme of study specifies three specific outcomes: swimming at least 25 metres using a range of strokes; using backstroke, breaststroke and front crawl; and performing safe self-rescue in different water-based situations. The inclusion of water safety as a distinct outcome, alongside swimming competence, reflects the life-critical nature of this skill: pupils are not merely developing a sport but acquiring an essential safety skill. Schools that cannot deliver swimming at KS1 must ensure it is delivered at KS2 so that the requirement is met before the end of primary education.

### Concepts (1)

#### PE-KS1-C004 — Swimming Competence and Water Safety
Type: skill | Complexity: 1 | Teaching weight: 1

Swimming competence combines the technical skills of using different swimming strokes with the physical confidence and stamina to swim a sustained distance. Water safety is distinct from swimming skill: it involves the knowledge and physical capability to survive in water in unexpected situations, including the ability to float on one's back and to tread water. At KS1/KS2, pupils develop both swimming skill and water safety awareness as complementary aspects of aquatic competence.

**Teaching guidance:** Develop water confidence before stroke technique by using games, floats and supported activity in shallow water. Introduce front crawl, backstroke and breaststroke systematically with clear technique points. Build up distance gradually, initially with floats and then independently. Teach floating and trebling water as explicit water safety skills, distinct from stroke swimming. Discuss scenarios where water safety matters - falling into a river, being in choppy seas - to give context to self-rescue skills. Ensure all pupils have equal access to swimming regardless of cultural or language barriers.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils and parents may not understand why all three strokes are required; explaining that different strokes are used in different conditions and that versatility is the goal helps. Some pupils may have significant water anxiety; a gradual, supportive approach that builds confidence before technique is essential. The distance of 25 metres can seem arbitrary; explaining that it represents the minimum for safe independent swimming in a pool context helps pupils understand the requirement.

**Key vocabulary:** stroke, front crawl, backstroke, breaststroke, breathe, float, tread water, distance, depth, safety, rescue, pool, technique, kick, pull

Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**PE-KS1-D004-CL001:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Each swimming stroke is a physical structure — a coordinated pattern of body position, arm action and leg kick — whose precise form determines its effectiveness; understanding how technique creates propulsion and reduces drag is a direct structure-function relationship.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Water safety knowledge is grounded in understanding cause-and-effect relationships in aquatic environments — why certain conditions are dangerous, what happens to the body when it fatigues in water, and how specific actions cause or prevent drowning risk.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

## Learner Profile (KS2, from Y3)

### Content Guidelines
**Reading level:** Most children are independent readers of simple texts. Reading fluency varies widely. Decoding is largely automatic for common words.
**Lexile range:** 150–350
**Flesch-Kincaid grade max:** 2
**Sentence length:** max 14 words, avg 9 words
**Vocabulary level:** curriculum_vocabulary_supported
**Vocabulary notes:** Subject vocabulary with inline glossary support. Abstract concepts grounded in familiar contexts. Similes and comparisons helpful (e.g., 'solid is like a brick').
**Academic vocabulary:** Avoid — use everyday language
**Text-to-speech:** Available on request
**TTS notes:** Available on demand. Recommended for EAL learners and those with reading difficulties.
**Sentence structure:** Simple and compound sentences. One subordinate clause maximum. Fronted adverbials acceptable.
**Number range:** 0–1000, simple fractions

**Agent content instructions:** Use clear, active sentences with one idea per sentence. Subject vocabulary can be used if first introduced with a definition. Avoid passive voice. Metaphors and similes are helpful for abstract science concepts. Questions can require 1–3 word written answers or spoken responses.

### Pedagogy Profile
**Session length:** 12–20 minutes, 4 activities
**Scaffolding level:** moderate_to_high
**Hint tiers:** max 3
**Hint notes:** Tier 1: 'What do you already know about this?' Tier 2: 'Remember when we learned [related concept]?' Tier 3: 'The first step is to [specific procedure]...'
**Worked examples:** Required (Text + diagram narrated. Step-by-step with child input at key points ('What would you do next?').)
**Productive failure:** Appropriate
**PF notes:** Introduce challenge problem first; expect partial or incorrect attempts. Move to worked example after child has made one or more attempts. Effect size d=0.36–0.58 (Sinha & Kapur 2021).
**Prerequisite gating:** Required
**Metacognitive prompts:** Not yet appropriate
**Mastery threshold:** 5 correct in 7 days (80%)
**Spacing:** Yes (2–7 day intervals)
**Interleaving:** Appropriate

**Agent pedagogy instructions:** Start with a challenge problem — do not explain first. Let the child attempt independently for 2–3 minutes. Collect their attempt. Then show the worked example. Follow with 3–4 retrieval practice questions that mix this concept with previously mastered material (interleaving). Contextualize difficulty: 'That one was harder — your brain was working to connect different ideas.'

### Feedback Profile
**AI tone:** warm_competence_focused
**Voice style:** Warm but more precise. Name the skill. Begin moving toward academic language.
**Feedback style:** specific_competence
**Immediate feedback:** Yes
**Normalise struggle:** Yes
**Positive error framing:** Yes
**Post-error approach:** Explain the specific error and model the correct reasoning: 'You got 7×8=54, but the correct answer is 56. If you know 7×7=49, then 7 more gives 56.'
**Counter misconceptions explicitly:** Not yet
**Metacognitive reflection:** Not yet
**Metacognitive examples:** []
**Gamification safety:** gamification unsafe, no progress bars, no leaderboards, no visible streaks
**Surprise/delight:** Yes (semi_random). Less frequent than Y1–Y2. Unexpected surprise moments only.
**Example feedback (correct):** "You spotted the pattern — all the multiples of 6 end in an even number. That is a really useful thing to notice."
**Example feedback (incorrect):** "That one got you — 7×8 trips up a lot of people. Here is a trick: 7×7 is 49, so 7×8 is just 7 more, which gives 56."
**Avoid phrases:** ["Wrong", "Incorrect", "You need to improve", "Well done!", "Amazing!"]

**Agent feedback instructions:** Specific competence feedback: name the pattern, rule, or skill the child demonstrated. On error, explain the specific misconception (not just 'wrong') and give the reasoning to fix it. Normalize productive struggle: 'That one took longer — your brain was making new connections.' Never compare to other children or previous performance.

### Interaction Types (15 total, 6 primary)

**Primary (recommended for this year group):**
- **Drag to Categorise** (manipulation, touch_or_mouse): Drag items into labelled category buckets. Used for classification tasks across subjects.
- **Matching Pairs** (manipulation, touch_or_mouse): Draw connections between matching items in two columns (term/definition, cause/effect, word/image).

- Voice Recorder — Record and Playback (input, voice): Record a spoken explanation or observation response. Plays back with waveform visualization and automatic transcription. Used for science observations, oral explanations, and hypothesis recording from Y2 onwards. Bridges the gap between oral capability and written production.

### Pedagogy Techniques (2)

**Interleaved Practice** **[NEW this year]**
Mixing different types of problems or concepts within a session rather than blocked practice (all of one type, then all of another). Interleaving requires the learner to identify the problem type before solving — this discrimination step is the source of its effect.
Evidence: Bjork 2011, Rohrer & Taylor 2007, Rohrer et al. 2015. Effect size d=0.42 over blocked practice. Transfer advantage approximately 30-40% on delayed tests.
Implementation: Mix the current concept with 2-3 previously mastered concepts in the retrieval practice phase of a session. Tell the child: 'You are practising different types of problems — that is what makes you better.' Surface features vary; underlying structure is the same.

**Spaced Practice**
Distributing practice over time rather than massing it in a single session. Creates desirable difficulty through time-based forgetting and subsequent retrieval. The gap between practice sessions is the mechanism — not re-studying, but retrieving after a delay.
Evidence: Ebbinghaus 1885, Cepeda et al. 2006 (meta-analysis, n=317 studies). Effect size d=0.46. Optimal spacing interval increases as retention target increases.
Implementation: Return to a previously taught concept after a gap of 1-21 days (gap increases as mastery grows). Do not re-teach — retrieve only. The system selects spacing interval based on days since last correct response.
