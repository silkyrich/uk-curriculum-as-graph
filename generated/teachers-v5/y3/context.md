# Teaching Context (from Graph)


## Domain: EN-Y3-D001 — Spoken Language
**Subject:** English | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-8 | **Structure:** mixed

### Curriculum Context
Spoken language at Year 3 continues the development of confident, purposeful oral communication that began in KS1, now with greater expectations for clarity, organisation and stamina in extended talk. Pupils are expected to build on the informal oral language of home and early schooling to develop more formal registers appropriate to different audiences and purposes — including explaining reasoning, retelling and discussing texts. The statutory curriculum requires all spoken language objectives to be developed continuously throughout the primary years, with teachers providing rich opportunities for debate, drama, collaborative discussion and formal presentation. Year 3 marks a transition point where pupils are expected to sustain extended contributions and actively listen and respond to others with increasing sophistication.

### Concepts (12)

#### EN-Y3-C001 — Active listening and appropriate response
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils develop active listening skills and respond appropriately in different social and learning contexts, including responding to teacher instructions and peer contributions

**Teaching guidance:** Build on KS1 listening by increasing the complexity of what children listen to and respond to — longer passages, multi-step instructions, and sustained partner discussions. Teach active listening strategies: make eye contact, nod, ask a follow-up question. Use think-pair-share routines so children rehearse their response with a partner before contributing to class discussion. Provide sentence stems for responses: 'I agree because...', 'I would add that...', 'Can you explain what you mean by...?'

**Common misconceptions:** Children may respond to a discussion prompt with an unrelated personal anecdote rather than addressing what was said. They may hear the last thing said but miss the overall point of a longer explanation. Some children respond immediately without processing, giving superficial or repetitive answers.

**Key vocabulary:** active listening, respond, relevant, appropriate, follow up, eye contact, body language, contribute

#### EN-Y3-C002 — Questioning to extend understanding
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils formulate and ask relevant questions that deepen their understanding of topics and texts

**Teaching guidance:** Teach children to ask questions that genuinely extend their understanding, not just factual recall questions. Model higher-order questioning during shared reading: 'Why do you think the author chose this word?', 'What would have happened if...?' Use Bloom's taxonomy question stems displayed in the classroom. Practise generating questions before, during and after reading. Teach children to distinguish between 'thin' questions (one right answer) and 'thick' questions (multiple possible answers requiring discussion).

**Common misconceptions:** Children often default to closed, factual questions rather than open-ended ones that promote deeper thinking. They may ask questions to which they already know the answer. Some children confuse questioning with guessing and feel embarrassed if their question reveals a gap in understanding.

**Key vocabulary:** question, enquiry, why, how, what if, wonder, investigate, extend, understanding, explore

#### EN-Y3-C003 — Vocabulary building strategies
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils actively develop their vocabulary through discussion, reading, using dictionaries and explicit learning strategies, including collecting and using new vocabulary

**Teaching guidance:** Teach explicit vocabulary-building strategies: using context clues to infer meaning, looking at word parts (prefixes, suffixes, root words), consulting a dictionary, and discussing shades of meaning between synonyms. Introduce 2-3 new words per text during guided and shared reading. Encourage children to collect interesting words in vocabulary journals. Use word-of-the-day or word-of-the-week routines with opportunities to use the new word in speech and writing throughout the day.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may skip unfamiliar words rather than using strategies to work out their meaning. They may assume a word has only one meaning and not consider alternative definitions. Some children learn definitions without understanding how to use the word in context, leading to awkward or incorrect usage in their own writing.

**Key vocabulary:** vocabulary, context clue, meaning, synonym, word part, dictionary, definition, precise, varied

#### EN-Y3-C004 — Articulating and justifying opinions
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 2

Pupils express their views clearly and provide reasons to support their thinking, justifying answers and arguments with evidence

**Teaching guidance:** Develop children's ability to state and defend a position using evidence. Teach the structure: state your opinion, give a reason, provide evidence or an example. Use discussion topics linked to texts being read: 'Do you think the character made the right decision? Give your reasons.' Practise in debates with simple structures where each child must state a position and give at least one supporting reason. Model the language of reasoned argument: 'firstly', 'in my opinion', 'the evidence for this is'.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may state strong opinions without any supporting reasoning. They may confuse personal preference with reasoned argument ('I think it's good because I like it'). Some children find it difficult to consider alternative viewpoints or to change their mind in response to new evidence.

**Key vocabulary:** opinion, justify, reason, evidence, because, I believe, in my view, firstly, support, argue

#### EN-Y3-C005 — Structured spoken descriptions and explanations
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils organise their spoken contributions with clear structure appropriate to different purposes, including describing settings, explaining processes and retelling stories

**Teaching guidance:** Teach children to give well-structured spoken descriptions, explanations and narratives using scaffolds such as: 'First... then... finally...' for sequences, 'It looks like... It feels like...' for descriptions, and 'The reason is... This is because...' for explanations. Provide opportunities to describe objects, pictures and experiences to a partner or group. Model structured talk yourself, pointing out how you organise what you say. Use talk frames displayed in the classroom for reference.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may give rambling, unstructured descriptions that jump between points. They may include irrelevant detail while omitting key information. Some children speak too quickly or in incomplete sentences when giving explanations, assuming the listener shares their knowledge and can fill in gaps.

**Key vocabulary:** describe, explain, sequence, structure, firstly, then, next, because, detail, clearly, organise

#### EN-Y3-C006 — Collaborative conversation
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils engage in extended discussions, staying focused on the topic, initiating and responding to contributions, and maintaining attention

**Teaching guidance:** Teach collaborative conversation skills by establishing group talk expectations: take turns, build on others' ideas, challenge politely, ask for clarification. Use structured group talk activities such as 'envoys' (one group member visits another group to share ideas), 'jigsaw' (each group member researches one aspect), and 'snowball' (pairs join fours, fours join eights). Assign roles within groups (speaker, listener, recorder, reporter) to ensure equitable participation.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may think collaboration means agreeing with everyone rather than constructively engaging with different ideas. Dominant speakers may assume a leadership role while quieter children disengage. Some groups focus on completing a task quickly rather than ensuring all members contribute and understand.

**Key vocabulary:** collaborate, group, build on, agree, disagree, add to, take turns, role, recorder, reporter

#### EN-Y3-C007 — Exploratory talk
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils use talk to think aloud, speculate, hypothesise and explore ideas, using spoken language to develop understanding

**Teaching guidance:** Teach exploratory talk — the kind of talk where children think aloud, try out ideas, speculate and hypothesise without the pressure of being right. Create a safe environment where tentative suggestions are valued: 'What if...', 'Maybe...', 'I'm not sure but I think...'. Use philosophy for children (P4C) sessions and open-ended discussion prompts linked to texts. Distinguish between presentational talk (polished, for an audience) and exploratory talk (rough, for thinking through ideas).

**Common misconceptions:** Children may feel that they must have a definitive answer before speaking, which inhibits exploratory talk. They may dismiss tentative ideas from peers as 'wrong'. Some children confuse exploratory talk with off-topic chatter. Others are reluctant to speculate because they fear being incorrect.

**Key vocabulary:** explore, wonder, what if, maybe, perhaps, I'm not sure, try out, think aloud, possible, idea

#### EN-Y3-C008 — Audible and fluent speech
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils develop clear, fluent speech and begin to use Standard English forms appropriately, with appropriate volume for different contexts

**Teaching guidance:** Teach children to speak audibly and fluently in different contexts: partner work, small group discussion, class presentations and performing to an audience. Use voice projection exercises and practise speaking clearly without shouting. Teach children to vary their pace and volume for effect. Provide opportunities for purposeful speaking: show-and-tell, book recommendations, presenting research to the class. Give specific feedback on clarity and fluency rather than just content.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may speak too quietly in whole-class settings because they are self-conscious, or too loudly in small groups because they are excited. They may speak too fast when nervous, making their speech difficult to follow. Some children are fluent in casual conversation but become halting and stilted when speaking in formal or presentational contexts.

**Key vocabulary:** audible, fluent, clear, volume, pace, project, audience, speak up, expression, articulate

#### EN-Y3-C009 — Spoken performance and drama
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils engage in a variety of spoken language activities including debates, presentations, role play, improvisations and performances, developing familiarity with a greater variety of situations, audiences and purposes

**Teaching guidance:** Use drama techniques to explore texts and develop spoken language: hot-seating (children answer questions in character), freeze-frame (creating still images of key moments), thought-tracking (speaking a character's inner thoughts aloud), and conscience alley (the class lines up to voice arguments for and against a character's decision). Link drama to writing by having children write in role after a drama session. Teach children to use voice, gesture and movement to convey character and emotion.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may perform actions without verbal language, relying on mime rather than developing spoken responses in role. They may break character frequently or find it difficult to respond spontaneously as a character. Some children treat drama as play rather than a structured learning activity with clear objectives.

**Key vocabulary:** drama, perform, character, role, voice, gesture, expression, hot-seat, freeze-frame, in role

#### EN-Y3-C010 — Audience engagement
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils develop awareness of their audience and adjust their speaking to engage and maintain listeners' interest

**Teaching guidance:** Teach children to engage an audience by making eye contact, using appropriate gestures, varying vocal tone and pace, and organising their content logically. Practise with show-and-tell, book recommendations and mini-presentations. Use video recording so children can observe their own performance and identify areas for improvement. Provide a simple framework for presentations: tell them what you'll talk about, give your main points, end with a summary or question for the audience.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may read from notes without looking up, losing audience engagement. They may speak in a monotone or too quietly for the audience to hear. Some children focus entirely on getting through their content without considering whether the audience understands or is interested.

**Key vocabulary:** audience, engage, eye contact, gesture, tone, pace, present, perform, beginning, ending, hook

#### EN-Y3-C011 — Evaluating different viewpoints
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils listen to and build on others' contributions while considering alternative perspectives

**Teaching guidance:** Teach children to consider different viewpoints when discussing texts, events or issues. Use activities where children must argue a position they do not personally hold. In guided reading, ask 'How do you think the other character felt?', 'Can you understand why they did that even if you disagree?' Use simple debate structures where children hear both sides before forming their own view. Model evaluating viewpoints: 'That's an interesting point because..., but I also think...'

**Common misconceptions:** Children may struggle to separate their own view from a character's perspective. They may dismiss alternative viewpoints rather than engaging with them. Some children change their position every time they hear a new argument, without weighing the strength of different reasons.

**Key vocabulary:** viewpoint, opinion, perspective, agree, disagree, both sides, consider, reason, evidence, fair

#### EN-Y3-C012 — Register and audience awareness
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils begin to adjust their language choices for different audiences and purposes, understanding differences between spoken and written language and between formal and informal registers

**Teaching guidance:** Begin developing awareness that spoken language changes depending on audience and situation. Contrast informal talk with friends and more formal talk with adults or in presentations. Discuss examples: 'How would you ask a friend to play? How would you ask the head teacher for permission?' Use role-play to practise switching between registers. Connect to writing by discussing how written language is typically more formal than spoken language, and how the audience for writing affects word choice and tone.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may not realise that they already adjust their language for different audiences and situations. They may think formal language means using long or complicated words rather than adjusting tone, vocabulary and sentence structure appropriately. Some children use very informal or colloquial language in all contexts.

**Key vocabulary:** register, formal, informal, audience, appropriate, polite, casual, situation, tone, adjust

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**EN-Y3-D001-CL001:**
- **Evidence and Argument** (primary): What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Relevant questioning and vocabulary-building through listening both position spoken contributions as responses to evidence — pupils are learning to extract and act on what others have said.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'
- **Perspective and Interpretation**: Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?
  Why: Active listening requires holding another speaker's viewpoint in mind; responding appropriately is about recognising and acknowledging the perspective being expressed.
  AI instruction: Use the PERSPECTIVE AND INTERPRETATION lens: prompt pupils to identify the author's or actor's viewpoint, consider what information or experience shapes that perspective, look for omissions or contradictions, and compare multiple accounts. Useful questions: 'Who wrote/said this, and why?', 'What might they have left out?', 'How would someone else see this differently?', 'What would change your view?'

**EN-Y3-D001-CL002:**
- **Evidence and Argument** (primary): What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Justifying opinions and giving structured explanations are the core argument-making skills — pupils must support claims with reasons, making this cluster directly about evidence_argument even in spoken form.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'
- **Perspective and Interpretation**: Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?
  Why: Articulating opinions requires pupils to identify and express their own viewpoint, and collaborative conversation requires tracking how others' perspectives differ from or agree with their own.
  AI instruction: Use the PERSPECTIVE AND INTERPRETATION lens: prompt pupils to identify the author's or actor's viewpoint, consider what information or experience shapes that perspective, look for omissions or contradictions, and compare multiple accounts. Useful questions: 'Who wrote/said this, and why?', 'What might they have left out?', 'How would someone else see this differently?', 'What would change your view?'

**EN-Y3-D001-CL003:**
- **Perspective and Interpretation** (primary): Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?
  Why: Evaluating viewpoints and audience/register awareness are both perspectival skills — pupils must understand that different people hold different views and that language choices must be adapted to who is listening.
  AI instruction: Use the PERSPECTIVE AND INTERPRETATION lens: prompt pupils to identify the author's or actor's viewpoint, consider what information or experience shapes that perspective, look for omissions or contradictions, and compare multiple accounts. Useful questions: 'Who wrote/said this, and why?', 'What might they have left out?', 'How would someone else see this differently?', 'What would change your view?'
- **Evidence and Argument**: What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Exploratory talk and spoken performance at this level require pupils to reason aloud, testing ideas against each other's contributions, which is a form of collaborative evidence-building.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'

## Domain: EN-Y3-D002 — Reading - Word Reading
**Subject:** English | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-8 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Reading — word reading at Year 3 moves beyond the phonics-dominated approach of KS1 to develop fluent, automatic decoding of a wider range of texts including those with more complex vocabulary. Pupils are expected to apply their growing knowledge of root words, prefixes and suffixes to read and understand new vocabulary encountered in reading. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to read most words fluently without needing to sound them out, and to re-read texts for accuracy and comprehension, self-correcting where necessary. The goal is secure, automatic word recognition that frees cognitive resources for comprehension, inference and appreciation of authorial craft.

### Concepts (4)

#### EN-Y3-C013 — Root words for reading and meaning
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils use understanding of root words to decode unfamiliar words and comprehend their meaning, applying growing knowledge of morphology to read aloud and understand new words

**Teaching guidance:** Build on KS1 root word knowledge by explicitly teaching how knowing a root word helps read and understand unfamiliar words. Use word webs showing families derived from a single root (e.g., 'help' → helpful, unhelpful, helpless, helper, helping). When children encounter unfamiliar words in reading, prompt them to look for a root word they recognise. Connect to the Year 3 prefixes and suffixes work by showing how roots combine with affixes to create new words with related meanings.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may misidentify root words by stripping off parts that are not actually affixes (e.g., thinking 'carpet' has the root 'car'). They may not realise that root words carry the core meaning and that affixes modify it. Some children recognise root words in isolation but do not apply this knowledge when encountering derived forms in reading.

**Key vocabulary:** root word, base word, word family, meaning, related, build, prefix, suffix, recognise, derive

#### EN-Y3-C014 — Prefixes and suffixes (etymology and morphology)
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils understand how prefixes and suffixes change word meanings and use this to read and comprehend new words, including prefixes dis-, mis-, in-, il-, im-, ir-, re-, sub-, inter-, super-, anti-, auto- and suffixes -ation, -ly, -ous

**Teaching guidance:** Teach the Year 3 prefixes (un-, dis-, mis-, re-, pre-, anti-, auto-, super-, sub-) and suffixes (-tion, -sion, -ly, -ous, -ment, -ness, -ful, -less) systematically, exploring how each affix changes meaning or word class. Group prefixes by meaning: negation (un-, dis-, mis-), repetition (re-), position (super-, sub-), self (auto-). Use word-building activities: give children root words and a set of affixes to combine. Connect morphology to reading comprehension — knowing word parts helps decode unfamiliar words.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may add affixes incorrectly, creating non-existent words. They may not understand that some affixes change the word class (e.g., adding -ly to an adjective creates an adverb). Some children confuse prefixes with suffixes or think that any group of letters at the start of a word is a prefix.

**Key vocabulary:** prefix, suffix, morphology, etymology, word part, meaning, un-, dis-, re-, -tion, -ly, -ous

#### EN-Y3-C015 — Exception words (Years 3-4)
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils read words with unusual spelling-sound correspondences from the Years 3-4 word list, noting where unusual patterns occur in words

**Teaching guidance:** Teach the Years 3-4 exception words through regular, systematic practice. Use look-say-cover-write-check, dictation, word sorts, and mnemonics. Display the words in the classroom and refer to them during writing. Group exception words by common patterns where possible (e.g., words with 'ough': though, thought, through; words with silent letters: island, knowledge). Assess regularly through dictation sentences that include several exception words in context.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may spell exception words phonetically (e.g., 'bizness' for 'business', 'diffrent' for 'different'). They may learn to recognise the words when reading but not be able to spell them from memory. Some children assume that all difficult words are exception words, when in fact many follow morphological or etymological patterns.

**Key vocabulary:** exception word, statutory word, learn, remember, practise, spelling, tricky, pattern, dictation

#### EN-Y3-C016 — Decoding strategies for longer words
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Pupils try different pronunciations of longer unfamiliar words to match them to vocabulary they have heard but not seen in print

**Teaching guidance:** Teach strategies for decoding longer, multi-syllabic words: breaking words into syllables, identifying root words within longer words, using knowledge of prefixes and suffixes, and reading through the whole word rather than guessing from the first few letters. Model the decoding process with unfamiliar words encountered in shared reading. Use activities where children physically divide written words into syllables. Ensure children know that they should focus on all the letters in a word, not just the beginning.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often guess at longer words based on the first syllable, producing errors that sound plausible but are incorrect (e.g., reading 'interesting' as 'international'). They may skip unfamiliar words entirely rather than attempting to decode them. Some children try to decode every word phoneme by phoneme rather than recognising larger chunks.

**Key vocabulary:** decode, multi-syllabic, syllable, break up, root word, prefix, suffix, sound out, read through

### ConceptClusters (2)

**EN-Y3-D002-CL001** — Use root words and morphology to decode and understand new words [CURATED]
Type: introduction
Concepts: EN-Y3-C013 (Root words for reading and meaning), EN-Y3-C014 (Prefixes and suffixes (etymology and morphology)), EN-Y3-C016 (Decoding strategies for longer words)
Rationale: Root words, prefixes/suffixes (etymology and morphology) and decoding strategies for longer words are the three interdependent strategies pupils use to read unfamiliar multisyllabic words; C013 lists C014 and C016 in co_teach_hints.
Inspired by: CC ELA RF.3.3 - Know and apply grade-level phonics and word analysis skills

**EN-Y3-D002-CL002** — Read and spell exception words from the Years 3-4 statutory list [CURATED]
Type: practice
Sequenced after: EN-Y3-D002-CL001
Concepts: EN-Y3-C015 (Exception words (Years 3-4))
Rationale: The Years 3-4 exception words list is a discrete statutory requirement requiring memorisation; it forms its own cluster as it is pedagogically distinct from morphological strategies.
Inspired by: CC ELA RF.3.3d - Read grade-appropriate irregularly spelled words

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**EN-Y3-D002-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Morphological decoding is pattern application: pupils use knowledge of root words, prefixes and suffixes as systematic clues to pronounce and infer the meaning of unfamiliar words.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Structure and Function**: How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Understanding how roots and affixes combine (structure) to produce new meanings (function) gives pupils a productive strategy for expanding vocabulary through analysis rather than memorisation.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'

**EN-Y3-D002-CL002:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Exception words are defined in relation to the GPC pattern system — they are words where the expected phonics rules do not apply, so recognising them as a category requires understanding the pattern well enough to identify the deviation.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

### Objectives (2)
- EN-Y3-O013 [statutory]: apply their growing knowledge of root words, prefixes and suffixes (etymology and morphology) as listed in English Appendix 1, both to read aloud and to understand the meaning of new words they meet
- EN-Y3-O014 [statutory]: read further exception words, noting the unusual correspondences between spelling and sound, and where these occur in the word

## Domain: EN-Y3-D003 — Reading - Comprehension
**Subject:** English | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-8 | **Structure:** mixed

### Curriculum Context
Reading comprehension at Year 3 deepens pupils' ability to understand, interpret and evaluate a widening range of texts including stories from other cultures, poetry, myths, legends and non-fiction. Pupils are expected to ask and answer questions about texts, predict what might happen from details stated and implied, draw inferences about characters' feelings, thoughts and motives, and identify how language and structure contribute to meaning. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to be familiar with a range of authors and to participate in discussion about books, building on the reading for pleasure habits established in KS1. Year 3 comprehension work focuses particularly on inference skills and on discussing how authors choose words for effect.

### Concepts (17)

#### EN-Y3-C017 — Wide reading for positive attitudes
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils develop positive attitudes to reading through exposure to diverse high-quality texts including fiction, poetry, plays, non-fiction and reference books

**Teaching guidance:** Foster positive attitudes to reading by providing access to a wide range of texts (fiction, non-fiction, poetry, graphic novels, magazines) and ensuring daily time for independent reading. Create an inviting reading environment with comfortable spaces and regularly updated book displays. Use book recommendations from peers and adults. Read aloud to the class daily from high-quality texts that children might not choose themselves. Respect children's reading choices while also broadening their repertoire through guided reading and class novels.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may develop fixed genre preferences and resist reading outside their comfort zone. Some children believe reading is only 'proper reading' if it involves chapter books, dismissing comics, poetry and non-fiction. Others may pretend to read during independent reading time without actually engaging with the text.

**Key vocabulary:** reading for pleasure, fiction, non-fiction, poetry, genre, favourite, author, recommend, wide reading

#### EN-Y3-C018 — Reading for different purposes
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils experience and understand different text structures and read for a range of purposes, including pleasure and information

**Teaching guidance:** Teach children that reading serves different purposes and that they should adapt their reading approach accordingly. Model reading for information (scanning, skimming, using contents and index), reading for pleasure (sustained, immersive reading), and reading to learn (close reading, rereading, note-taking). Provide authentic purposes for reading: following instructions to make something, researching a topic, reading a story for enjoyment, reading a poem to perform. Discuss the difference between these approaches explicitly.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may read all texts in the same way regardless of purpose — reading an information text from start to finish instead of using the contents page to find relevant sections. They may not understand that different text types have different structures designed for different purposes.

**Key vocabulary:** purpose, information, pleasure, learn, scan, skim, close reading, contents, index, non-fiction

#### EN-Y3-C019 — Dictionary use for reading comprehension
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils develop dictionary skills to independently find the meaning of words encountered in reading, using alphabetical order and first two or three letters

**Teaching guidance:** Teach dictionary skills systematically in Year 3: using alphabetical order to the second and third letter to locate words quickly, reading definitions and selecting the appropriate meaning when multiple senses are given, and using the dictionary as a reading comprehension tool. Model looking up unfamiliar words encountered in shared reading. Teach children to read around the word first to see if context provides sufficient clues, using the dictionary to confirm or correct their inference.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may look up every unfamiliar word, disrupting the flow of reading, rather than using context first and the dictionary to confirm. They may select the first definition listed without checking whether it fits the context. Some children struggle with alphabetical order beyond the first letter, making dictionary searches slow and frustrating.

**Key vocabulary:** dictionary, alphabetical order, definition, meaning, entry, look up, word, headword, guide word

#### EN-Y3-C020 — Fairy stories, myths and legends
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils build familiarity with traditional literature including fairy stories, myths and legends from various traditions, and retell some of these orally

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce and explore fairy stories, myths and legends as distinct literary forms. Teach the conventions of each: fairy stories have magic, good vs evil, repeated patterns ('Once upon a time...'); myths explain natural phenomena and involve gods or supernatural beings; legends are stories about heroic or historical figures that may have some basis in truth. Read examples from different cultures. Discuss how these stories pass down cultural values and beliefs. Use as models for children's own writing.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often use 'fairy tale', 'myth' and 'legend' interchangeably without understanding the distinctions. They may think myths are simply 'untrue stories' rather than narratives that served cultural or explanatory purposes. Some children assume all traditional stories come from one culture.

**Key vocabulary:** fairy story, myth, legend, traditional tale, character, hero, villain, moral, magic, convention, retell

#### EN-Y3-C021 — Themes and conventions in books
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils recognise common themes (e.g. good vs evil, triumph, use of magical devices) and understand genre conventions in a wide range of books

**Teaching guidance:** Teach children to identify themes (the underlying ideas or messages in a text, such as friendship, bravery, jealousy) and conventions (the typical features of a genre, such as the quest structure in adventure stories or the 'once upon a time' opening in fairy tales). Use explicit teaching: 'The theme of this story is friendship because...' Provide graphic organisers where children record evidence of themes across a text. Compare themes across different texts read during the term.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often confuse the theme with the plot, stating what happens rather than what the story is about at a deeper level. They may identify a theme without providing supporting evidence from the text. Some children think a story can have only one theme.

**Key vocabulary:** theme, convention, genre, message, moral, pattern, idea, feature, example, evidence, compare

#### EN-Y3-C022 — Poetry and play performance
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils prepare and perform poems and play scripts showing understanding through intonation, tone, volume and action, using drama approaches to explore meaning

**Teaching guidance:** Provide regular opportunities for children to rehearse and perform poems and play scripts. Teach performance skills: using voice (volume, pace, pause, intonation) and body (gesture, movement, facial expression) to bring a text to life. Begin with choral speaking of poems before moving to individual or small-group performances. Discuss how a performer's choices affect the audience's experience. Use readers' theatre with play scripts, assigning roles and practising expressive reading before performing to an audience.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may recite poems or read scripts in a flat monotone without expression. They may rush through a performance because of nervousness. Some children focus on memorisation at the expense of expression and meaning. Others may add exaggerated actions that distract from the text rather than enhancing it.

**Key vocabulary:** perform, rehearse, expression, intonation, volume, pace, gesture, audience, script, poem, voice

#### EN-Y3-C023 — Effective language in texts
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 2

Pupils identify and appreciate effective language choices, discussing words and phrases that capture the reader's interest and imagination

**Teaching guidance:** Teach children to identify and discuss the effect of writers' language choices. During shared reading, highlight specific words and phrases, asking: 'Why did the author choose this word? What effect does it have? What picture does it create in your mind?' Introduce the concept of word choice as a deliberate authorial decision. Model identifying powerful verbs, precise adjectives, and figurative language. Encourage children to 'magpie' effective language from their reading for use in their own writing.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may describe language as 'good' or 'nice' without being able to explain what makes it effective. They may focus on finding 'wow words' (long or unusual words) rather than understanding how well-chosen simple words can also be powerful. Some children do not connect their analysis of language in reading to their own writing choices.

**Key vocabulary:** language, word choice, effect, powerful, vivid, author, writer, describe, imagine, create, picture

#### EN-Y3-C024 — Forms of poetry
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils recognise and understand different poetic forms and their characteristics, including free verse and narrative poetry

**Teaching guidance:** Teach children to recognise and appreciate different forms of poetry: rhyming poetry, free verse, haiku, kennings, acrostic, concrete/shape poems, narrative poetry, limericks and nonsense verse. Read a wide range of poetry aloud, discussing how the form shapes the content. Encourage children to learn poems by heart. Teach children to write in different poetic forms, providing clear models and frameworks. Display poetry in the classroom and make poetry anthologies available for independent reading.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may think all poetry must rhyme. They may not appreciate that poetry has different forms with different rules and conventions. Some children think poetry is simply short prose with line breaks. Others may feel they cannot write poetry because they cannot find rhyming words.

**Key vocabulary:** poem, verse, rhyme, rhythm, stanza, haiku, limerick, free verse, acrostic, pattern, form, poet

#### EN-Y3-C025 — Comprehension monitoring
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils check that text makes sense, re-reading when unclear and using context to understand the meaning of words

**Teaching guidance:** Teach comprehension monitoring — the ability to notice when meaning breaks down and to take corrective action. Model the inner voice of a reader: 'Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me reread that sentence.' Teach specific fix-up strategies: rereading the sentence, reading on to see if meaning becomes clear, looking at pictures or diagrams, breaking down unfamiliar words, and asking for help. Use think-alouds during shared reading to demonstrate monitoring in action.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often continue reading past points of confusion without noticing that comprehension has broken down. They may not realise that rereading is a legitimate and effective strategy rather than a sign of failure. Some children monitor for individual word accuracy but not for overall meaning.

**Key vocabulary:** check, monitor, make sense, reread, understand, confused, fix up, strategy, notice, meaning

#### EN-Y3-C026 — Questions to improve reading comprehension
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils formulate questions to deepen comprehension of texts, asking about characters, events, author intentions and unclear parts

**Teaching guidance:** Teach children to generate their own questions about texts as a comprehension strategy. Model questioning before, during and after reading: 'Before I read, I wonder...', 'As I read this paragraph, I'm wondering...', 'Now I've finished, I still want to know...' Use question stems displayed in the classroom. Teach the difference between literal questions (answered directly in the text) and inferential questions (requiring the reader to draw conclusions). Use reciprocal reading where the 'questioner' role is rotated.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may ask questions that can be answered by simply rereading the text rather than questions that deepen understanding. They may confuse asking questions with testing each other on recall. Some children do not see questioning as a reading strategy, viewing it as something the teacher does.

**Key vocabulary:** question, wonder, why, how, what if, literal, inferential, understand, comprehension, curious

#### EN-Y3-C027 — Drawing inferences with evidence
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils read between the lines to infer characters' feelings, thoughts and motives from their actions, justifying inferences with evidence from the text

**Teaching guidance:** Develop inference skills by teaching children to combine information from the text with their own knowledge to draw conclusions. Use the PEE structure: Point (what you infer), Evidence (quote from the text), Explanation (how the evidence supports your inference). Start with character feelings and motivations: 'How does the character feel? What in the text tells you that?' Use visual texts (picture books, illustrated stories) alongside written texts to practise inference. Teach the language of inference: 'This suggests...', 'This implies...', 'I think this because...'

**Common misconceptions:** Children often state feelings or thoughts without linking them to evidence from the text. They may confuse inference with prediction or simply retell what the text says explicitly. Some children make inferences that are unsupported by the text, drawing on personal experience rather than textual evidence.

**Key vocabulary:** infer, inference, evidence, clue, suggest, imply, because, I think, the text says, this shows

#### EN-Y3-C028 — Prediction from stated and implied detail
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils use explicit and implicit textual clues to make reasoned predictions about plot and character

**Teaching guidance:** Teach prediction as an ongoing reading strategy, not just a pre-reading activity. Encourage children to predict at key points in a text: 'Based on what has happened so far, what do you think will happen next? Why?' Teach children to use both stated information (what the text says explicitly) and implied information (what can be inferred) to support their predictions. After reading on, revisit predictions: 'Were we right? What actually happened? What clues did we miss?'

**Common misconceptions:** Children may make predictions based on personal preference ('I think the dog will be rescued because I like dogs') rather than textual evidence. They may not distinguish between a prediction (based on evidence) and a guess (random). Some children make predictions but never check them against what actually happens.

**Key vocabulary:** predict, prediction, clue, evidence, expect, because, based on, I think, confirm, revise

#### EN-Y3-C029 — Identifying and summarising main ideas
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils extract key information across multiple paragraphs, identifying main ideas and creating brief summaries

**Teaching guidance:** Teach summarising by modelling how to identify the main idea of a paragraph or section and distinguish it from supporting details. Use the strategy: 'If I had to tell someone what this paragraph is about in one sentence, what would I say?' Practise with non-fiction texts where main ideas are often stated explicitly. In narrative, focus on identifying the key events rather than retelling every detail. Use graphic organisers (main idea maps, flow charts) to support summarising. Limit summaries to a set number of words or sentences.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often retell a text in extensive detail rather than summarising the key points. They may confuse a main idea with an interesting detail. Some children include personal opinions in a summary rather than sticking to what the text says. Others struggle to identify the main idea when it is implied rather than stated.

**Key vocabulary:** main idea, summarise, key point, detail, important, brief, in short, retell, gist, paragraph

#### EN-Y3-C030 — Language, structure and presentation contributing to meaning
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils understand how authors use language choices, text structure and presentational features to convey meaning, including conventions of different text types

**Teaching guidance:** Teach children to notice how language choices, text structure and presentational features contribute to meaning. In fiction, discuss how an author's vocabulary and sentence structure create mood, pace and tone. In non-fiction, discuss how headings, subheadings, bullet points, diagrams and bold text help organise and communicate information. Compare texts that present the same content differently and discuss the effect of each approach. Link to children's own writing: 'How could you organise your writing so the reader can find information easily?'

**Common misconceptions:** Children may not notice structural and presentational features, reading past them without understanding their purpose. They may think headings and subheadings are decorative rather than organisational. Some children struggle to articulate how language choices contribute to meaning beyond saying they are 'good' or 'interesting'.

**Key vocabulary:** language, structure, presentation, heading, subheading, layout, diagram, bold, effect, meaning, organise

#### EN-Y3-C031 — Retrieving and recording information from non-fiction
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils locate specific information in non-fiction texts using contents pages and indexes, knowing what information they need before beginning

**Teaching guidance:** Teach children to retrieve and record information from non-fiction texts. Model using contents pages, indexes and glossaries to locate specific information. Teach note-taking strategies: using bullet points, using own words rather than copying, and recording the source. Provide structured research tasks where children must find and record specific information. Teach the difference between retrieving (finding facts that are stated) and interpreting (working out what facts mean). Connect to cross-curricular research in history, geography and science.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often copy chunks of text verbatim rather than recording information in their own words. They may not use navigational features (contents, index) to find information efficiently, instead reading entire texts from start to finish. Some children struggle to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information when researching a specific question.

**Key vocabulary:** retrieve, record, information, non-fiction, contents, index, glossary, notes, source, fact, research

#### EN-Y3-C032 — Discussion about books
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils engage in collaborative talk about texts, taking turns, listening to others, and developing rules for effective discussion

**Teaching guidance:** Create a structured discussion culture around books through guided reading discussions, book clubs and whole-class shared reading. Teach discussion skills: taking turns, building on others' contributions, referring to the text to support points, and respectfully challenging ideas. Use open-ended discussion prompts: 'What was the most important moment in this chapter?', 'Do you agree with the character's decision?', 'How does this book compare to...?' Display discussion sentence starters and encourage children to use them.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may retell the plot during discussion rather than sharing their personal responses and interpretations. They may wait for the teacher to ask questions rather than initiating their own contributions. Some children dominate discussions while others contribute little without explicit turn-taking structures.

**Key vocabulary:** discuss, respond, opinion, evidence, agree, disagree, compare, I think, the text says, build on

#### EN-Y3-C033 — Silent reading with understanding
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils develop the ability to read silently while maintaining comprehension, developing stamina for sustained independent reading

**Teaching guidance:** Develop the transition from reading aloud to independent silent reading. Ensure children have daily silent reading time with appropriately challenging texts. Teach children to maintain concentration during sustained silent reading, starting with short periods (5-10 minutes) and gradually extending. Monitor comprehension of silently read texts through brief discussions, reading journals or comprehension questions. Ensure children are reading texts they can decode accurately (at least 95% accuracy) so that comprehension is not undermined by word-level difficulties.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may appear to be reading silently but actually be skimming or turning pages without engaging with meaning. Some children mouth words or whisper during silent reading because they have not yet internalised the transition from oral to silent reading. Others choose texts that are too difficult for independent reading, undermining comprehension.

**Key vocabulary:** silent reading, independent, concentrate, sustain, comprehension, focus, meaning, understand, engage

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**EN-Y3-D003-CL001:**
- **Perspective and Interpretation** (primary): Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?
  Why: Reading across genres and for different purposes develops pupils' capacity to adopt different reading stances — the reader of fiction interprets character and theme while the reader of non-fiction evaluates information.
  AI instruction: Use the PERSPECTIVE AND INTERPRETATION lens: prompt pupils to identify the author's or actor's viewpoint, consider what information or experience shapes that perspective, look for omissions or contradictions, and compare multiple accounts. Useful questions: 'Who wrote/said this, and why?', 'What might they have left out?', 'How would someone else see this differently?', 'What would change your view?'
- **Continuity and Change Over Time**: What has stayed the same, what has changed, and what drove that change?
  Why: Building positive reading habits over time is an incremental process — the cluster is explicitly about developing attitudes and stamina that change and grow across the year, not a single lesson outcome.
  AI instruction: Use the CONTINUITY AND CHANGE OVER TIME lens: prompt pupils to construct timelines, identify turning points, distinguish what changed from what persisted, and explain what drove change. Useful questions: 'What was the same before and after?', 'What was the turning point?', 'Was this a sudden change or a gradual shift?', 'Who or what drove this change?'

**EN-Y3-D003-CL002:**
- **Perspective and Interpretation** (primary): Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?
  Why: Recognising themes, poetic forms and the conventions of fairy stories/myths requires pupils to understand texts as shaped by authors with purposes — they interpret what a text is doing, not just what it says.
  AI instruction: Use the PERSPECTIVE AND INTERPRETATION lens: prompt pupils to identify the author's or actor's viewpoint, consider what information or experience shapes that perspective, look for omissions or contradictions, and compare multiple accounts. Useful questions: 'Who wrote/said this, and why?', 'What might they have left out?', 'How would someone else see this differently?', 'What would change your view?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Genre conventions (fairy tale structure, play format, poetic forms) and effective language patterns are recurring textual features that pupils learn to recognise as categories applicable across multiple texts.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**EN-Y3-D003-CL003:**
- **Evidence and Argument** (primary): What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Drawing inferences with evidence and identifying main ideas are explicitly evidence-grounded skills — pupils must locate textual support for their interpretive claims, not just state what they think.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'
- **Perspective and Interpretation**: Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?
  Why: Inference at Y3 increasingly involves reconstructing characters' feelings and motivations, requiring pupils to ask what perspective a character or narrator occupies and what shapes their view.
  AI instruction: Use the PERSPECTIVE AND INTERPRETATION lens: prompt pupils to identify the author's or actor's viewpoint, consider what information or experience shapes that perspective, look for omissions or contradictions, and compare multiple accounts. Useful questions: 'Who wrote/said this, and why?', 'What might they have left out?', 'How would someone else see this differently?', 'What would change your view?'

**EN-Y3-D003-CL004:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: The explicit focus of this cluster is how language choices and structural organisation (headings, layout, sequence) function to create meaning — it is a direct structure-function analysis task across both fiction and non-fiction.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Evidence and Argument**: What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Retrieving from non-fiction and discussing how language creates meaning requires pupils to use specific textual evidence to support their analytical claims, bridging retrieval and interpretation.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'

## Domain: EN-Y3-D004 — Writing - Transcription (Spelling)
**Subject:** English | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-8 | **Structure:** sequential

### Curriculum Context
Writing — transcription: spelling at Year 3 introduces pupils to a wider range of spelling rules and conventions, moving beyond the high-frequency words and basic phonics patterns of KS1. Pupils learn to use the first two or three letters of a word to locate it in a dictionary, add common prefixes and suffixes and understand how they change meaning or function, and spell homophones correctly. The statutory curriculum includes specific statutory word lists for Years 3 and 4 that pupils are expected to learn, covering common exception words not decodable by standard phonics rules. Accurate spelling at Year 3 requires regular revisiting and testing of spellings in context, alongside explicit teaching of the spelling conventions and their exceptions.

### Concepts (8)

#### EN-Y3-C034 — Prefixes and suffixes spelling rules
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils apply spelling rules for adding prefixes and suffixes to root words, including rules for dis-, mis-, in- (and variants il-, im-, ir-), re-, sub-, inter-, super-, anti-, auto-, -ation and -ly

**Teaching guidance:** Teach the Year 3 prefix and suffix spelling rules systematically. Key prefixes: un-, dis-, mis-, re-, pre-, anti-, auto-, super-, sub- — teach that the spelling of the root word does not change when a prefix is added. Key suffixes: -ly (adjective → adverb), -ous (noun → adjective), -tion/-sion (verb → noun). Teach rules for adding suffixes that require spelling changes: dropping the final 'e' before vowel suffixes, changing 'y' to 'i', and the -tion/-sion patterns. Use word-sorting and word-building activities.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may incorrectly change the root word's spelling when adding a prefix (e.g., writing 'dissappoint' instead of 'disappoint'). They may forget to drop the final 'e' before a vowel suffix (e.g., 'hopeing' for 'hoping'). The -tion/-sion distinction is challenging because both produce a similar sound.

**Key vocabulary:** prefix, suffix, root word, spelling rule, un-, dis-, mis-, re-, -ly, -ous, -tion, -sion, word part

#### EN-Y3-C035 — Suffix doubling rules for polysyllabic words
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils apply the rule for doubling final consonants in stressed syllables before vowel suffixes (forgetting, preferred, beginning) and not doubling in unstressed syllables (gardening, limiting)

**Teaching guidance:** Teach the consonant doubling rule for polysyllabic words: when adding a vowel suffix (-ing, -ed, -er, -est) to a word where the last syllable is stressed and ends in a single consonant after a single vowel, double the final consonant (e.g., begin → beginning, forget → forgetting, prefer → preferred). Contrast with words where the last syllable is not stressed, where doubling does not occur (e.g., garden → gardening, visit → visiting). Use sorting activities to practise identifying when doubling is needed.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often apply the doubling rule inconsistently, sometimes doubling when they should not (e.g., 'enterring') or failing to double when they should (e.g., 'begining'). They may not understand the concept of syllable stress, making it difficult to apply the rule by ear. Some children over-generalise, doubling consonants in all words when adding suffixes.

**Key vocabulary:** double, consonant, suffix, stressed syllable, -ing, -ed, polysyllabic, rule, single vowel

#### EN-Y3-C036 — Homophones (Years 3-4)
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils correctly spell pairs and groups of words that sound the same but have different meanings and spellings, including accept/except, affect/effect, brake/break, grate/great, weather/whether and others from the Years 3-4 list

**Teaching guidance:** Teach the Years 3-4 homophones and near-homophones systematically: accept/except, affect/effect, ball/bawl, berry/bury, brake/break, fair/fare, grate/great, groan/grown, heel/heal/he'll, knot/not, mail/male, main/mane, meat/meet, medal/meddle, missed/mist, peace/piece, plain/plane, rain/reign/rein, scene/seen, weather/whether, whose/who's. Teach each pair with clear definitions, pictures and example sentences. Practise through cloze exercises where children choose the correct homophone.

**Common misconceptions:** Children frequently select the more familiar spelling regardless of meaning (e.g., always writing 'there' instead of distinguishing 'their' and 'they're'). They may not check which meaning is intended when writing. Some children do not hear any difference between near-homophones and therefore do not understand why two spellings exist.

**Key vocabulary:** homophone, same sound, different meaning, different spelling, pair, context, choose, which one

#### EN-Y3-C037 — Spelling patterns from various etymologies
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils learn specific spelling patterns from Greek, Latin and French origins including: /i/ spelt y (myth, gym), /u/ spelt ou (young), -ous suffix, -sure/-ture endings, -sion/-tion/-ssion/-cian endings, ch spelt Greek-style (chorus, scheme), ch spelt French-style (chef, machine), -gue/-que endings, sc for /s/ (science), ei/eigh/ey for /ei/ (vein, eight)

**Teaching guidance:** Teach spelling patterns that derive from different etymological origins of English words. Key Year 3 patterns include: the /ʃ/ sound spelt 'ch' (from French — chef, machine, brochure), the /k/ sound spelt 'ch' (from Greek — chorus, character, school), and words ending in '-gue' and '-que' (from French — league, tongue, antique, unique). Group words by their shared origin and pattern. Use etymological information to explain why these words are spelt as they are, connecting spelling to the history of the English language.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may apply standard English phonics rules to words of French or Greek origin, producing incorrect spellings (e.g., spelling 'machine' as 'masheen'). They may not realise that English has borrowed words from many languages, each bringing its own spelling conventions. Some children find it difficult to remember which 'ch' pattern applies to which word.

**Key vocabulary:** spelling pattern, origin, French, Greek, Latin, etymology, /ʃ/ sound, /k/ sound, -gue, -que

#### EN-Y3-C038 — Years 3-4 statutory word list
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils learn to spell the statutory Years 3-4 word list including: accident, actual, address, answer, appear, arrive, believe, bicycle, breath, build, busy, calendar, caught, centre, century, certain, circle, complete, consider, continue, decide, describe, different, difficult, disappear, early, earth, eight, enough, exercise, experience, experiment, extreme, famous, favourite, February, forward, fruit, grammar, group, guard, guide, heard, heart, height, history, imagine, important, increase, interest, island, knowledge, learn, length, library, material, medicine, mention, minute, natural, naughty, notice, occasion, often, opposite, ordinary, particular, peculiar, perhaps, popular, position, possess, possible, potatoes, pressure, probably, promise, purpose, quarter, question, recent, regular, reign, remember, sentence, separate, special, straight, strange, strength, suppose, surprise, therefore, though, thought, through, various, weight, woman

**Teaching guidance:** Teach the Years 3-4 statutory word list through systematic, regular practice. These words include: accident(ally), actual(ly), address, answer, appear, arrive, believe, bicycle, breath(e), build, busy/business, calendar, caught, centre, century, certain, circle, complete, consider, continue, decide, describe, different, difficult, disappear, early, earth, eight/eighth, enough, exercise, experience, experiment, extreme, famous, favourite, February, forward(s), fruit, grammar, group, guard, guide, heard, heart, height, history, imagine, important, increase, interest, island, knowledge, learn, length, library, material, medicine, mention, minute, natural, naughty, notice, occasion(ally), often, opposite, ordinary, particular, peculiar, perhaps, popular, position, possess(ion), possible, potatoes, pressure, probably, promise, purpose, quarter, question, recent, regular, reign, remember, sentence, separate, special, straight, strange, strength, suppose, surprise, therefore, though/although, thought, through, various, weight, woman/women. Use dictation, word sorts, mnemonics and regular assessment.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may spell these words phonetically (e.g., 'bisniss' for 'business', 'anser' for 'answer'). They may confuse similar-looking words (e.g., 'though' and 'through'). Some children can read these words but cannot produce the correct spelling from memory without further practice.

**Key vocabulary:** statutory word list, exception word, spelling, learn, practise, remember, dictation, pattern, tricky

#### EN-Y3-C039 — Possessive apostrophe with plural nouns
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils place the possessive apostrophe accurately with regular plurals (girls', boys', babies') and irregular plurals (children's, men's, mice's)

**Teaching guidance:** Teach the possessive apostrophe with plural nouns as a progression from the Year 2 singular possessive. Teach the rule: for regular plurals ending in -s, add an apostrophe after the 's' (the girls' coats, the dogs' leads); for irregular plurals not ending in -s, add apostrophe + s (the children's toys, the men's room). Use physical objects and labels to practise. Provide sorting activities distinguishing between plural -s, possessive 's, and plural possessive s'. Practise in the context of sentence writing.

**Common misconceptions:** Children frequently confuse plural -s, singular possessive 's, and plural possessive s'. They may place the apostrophe before the -s even for plural possessives (e.g., 'the dog's leads' when meaning multiple dogs). The irregular plural possessive (children's) is particularly confusing because it follows the singular pattern.

**Key vocabulary:** possessive apostrophe, plural, belongs to, ownership, regular plural, irregular plural, apostrophe, s'

#### EN-Y3-C040 — Dictionary use for spelling
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils use the first two or three letters of a word to check and correct spellings in a dictionary, developing efficient dictionary skills

**Teaching guidance:** Teach dictionary use for spelling: when children are unsure of a spelling, teach them to make a best guess based on their phonic and morphological knowledge, then check the dictionary. Teach strategies for looking up words when you do not know the exact spelling: try different plausible spellings, use the initial phonemes to navigate to the right section, and check words around the entry you expect. Model dictionary use for spelling regularly during shared writing. Provide age-appropriate dictionaries that are quick to navigate.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may not think to use a dictionary for spelling, seeing it only as a tool for finding meanings. They may struggle to locate a word when they do not know the first few letters of the correct spelling. Some children find dictionary use too slow and disruptive to their writing flow, requiring teaching of efficient search strategies.

**Key vocabulary:** dictionary, spelling, check, look up, alphabetical order, entry, correct, guess, confirm, verify

#### EN-Y3-C041 — Writing from dictation
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils write from memory simple sentences dictated by the teacher, demonstrating application of spelling and punctuation knowledge taught so far

**Teaching guidance:** Use dictation as a regular practice activity for spelling and punctuation. Read sentences aloud at a pace that allows children to write each word, drawing on their phonics, spelling rules and knowledge of exception words. Begin with short sentences using familiar vocabulary and progress to longer sentences with more challenging spellings. After dictation, children self-check against the correct version and identify errors. Dictation develops the ability to hold a sentence in working memory while applying spelling and punctuation knowledge.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may struggle to hold a whole sentence in working memory, particularly if they are slow writers or if the sentence is long. They may focus on spelling at the expense of punctuation or vice versa. Some children write what they think they heard rather than using their spelling knowledge to produce the correct form.

**Key vocabulary:** dictation, listen, write, sentence, spell, punctuation, check, correct, memory, accurate

**EN-Y3-D004-CL001** — Apply prefixes, suffixes and doubling rules to spell derived words [CURATED]
Type: introduction
Concepts: EN-Y3-C034 (Prefixes and suffixes spelling rules), EN-Y3-C035 (Suffix doubling rules for polysyllabic words)
Rationale: Spelling rules for prefixes/suffixes and the suffix doubling rule for polysyllabic words are the two morphological spelling rules introduced in Y3; C035 lists C034 in its co_teach_hints.
Inspired by: CC ELA L.3.2e - Use conventional spelling for high-frequency and other studied words

Rationale: Possessive apostrophe with plural nouns, dictionary use for spelling, and writing from dictation are the application and accuracy-checking skills that consolidate all spelling learning into self-monitoring practice.
Inspired by: CC ELA L.3.2g - Consult reference materials to check and correct spellings

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**EN-Y3-D004-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Morphological spelling rules (prefix attachment, suffix doubling) are pattern-based — pupils must identify the class of word being modified and apply the relevant rule consistently across all cases.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**EN-Y3-D004-CL002:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Etymology-based spelling patterns (Greek, Latin, French origins) and statutory word lists are both about understanding why words are spelled as they are — historical patterns explain current spelling conventions.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**EN-Y3-D004-CL003:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Possessive apostrophe with plural nouns is a grammatical pattern applied across all plural possessives; dictionary use is pattern-based reference skill; together they reinforce the rule-governed nature of accurate spelling.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Evidence and Argument**: What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Using dictation and dictionaries frames accurate spelling as evidence-checking — pupils verify their own spelling against an authoritative source, building self-monitoring habits.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'

## Domain: EN-Y3-D005 — Writing - Transcription (Handwriting)
**Subject:** English | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-8 | **Structure:** sequential

### Curriculum Context
Handwriting at Year 3 focuses on developing fluent, joined handwriting as the standard form of written communication, consolidating the letter formation and beginning joins of KS1. Pupils are expected to use joined handwriting consistently and to develop a personal style that balances legibility, speed and accuracy. The statutory curriculum requires that pupils can write capital letters and digits that are of the correct size and orientation, and that handwriting is sufficiently automatic to support the compositional demands of extended writing. By Year 3, the focus shifts from forming individual letters correctly to developing the smooth, efficient hand movements that enable sustained, legible writing at speed.

### Concepts (2)

#### EN-Y3-C042 — Joining strokes in handwriting
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils use the diagonal and horizontal strokes needed to join letters and understand which letters, when adjacent, are best left unjoined

**Teaching guidance:** Continue developing joined handwriting in Year 3, building on the joins introduced in Year 2. Teach all four basic joins (diagonal to ascender, diagonal to non-ascender, horizontal to ascender, horizontal to non-ascender) with fluency and consistency. Practise joining within high-frequency words and spelling words. Ensure that children can maintain correct letter formation and size while joining. Teach that some letters (capital letters, after certain letters) may need a pen lift. Practise joining in the context of independent writing, not just in handwriting sessions.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may sacrifice legibility for the sake of joining every letter. They may make incorrect joins that distort letter shapes (e.g., the 'r' join often causes problems). Some children join successfully in handwriting practice but revert to print in independent writing because joined writing requires more cognitive effort.

**Key vocabulary:** join, joining, cursive, stroke, diagonal, horizontal, fluent, consistent, pen lift, handwriting

#### EN-Y3-C043 — Handwriting quality and consistency
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils increase the legibility, consistency and quality of their joined handwriting, ensuring parallel equidistant downstrokes and sufficient spacing for ascenders and descenders

**Teaching guidance:** Develop handwriting quality and consistency in Year 3 by focusing on even letter sizing, consistent spacing between words, correct use of ascenders and descenders, and overall neatness. Use the school's handwriting programme for regular practice. Encourage self-assessment: children compare their handwriting to a model and identify areas for improvement. Ensure children write on correctly lined paper and use the lines as guides. Discuss the importance of legible handwriting for communication — the reader needs to be able to read what has been written.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may write neatly in handwriting practice but produce untidy work in other subjects because they are concentrating on content rather than presentation. They may think that neat handwriting is about artistic ability rather than consistent application of correct formation. Some children write very small or very large, making their work difficult to read.

**Key vocabulary:** quality, consistency, neat, legible, size, spacing, ascender, descender, proportion, presentation

### External Prerequisites (from other domains)
- EN-KS1-C037 (Letter families) → EN-Y3-C042 (Joining strokes in handwriting)
- EN-KS1-C037 (Letter families) → EN-Y3-C043 (Handwriting quality and consistency)

### ConceptClusters (1)

**EN-Y3-D005-CL001** — Join letters fluently and develop consistent handwriting quality [CURATED]
Type: practice
Concepts: EN-Y3-C042 (Joining strokes in handwriting), EN-Y3-C043 (Handwriting quality and consistency)
Rationale: Joining strokes and handwriting quality/consistency are the two aspects of the Y3 handwriting curriculum — the mechanics of joining and the quality standards to achieve; taught together throughout.
Inspired by: CC ELA L.3.3 - Use knowledge of language and its conventions when writing

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**EN-Y3-D005-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Joining strokes are systematic — different letter endings follow different joining patterns. Developing consistency requires pupils to recognise and reproduce these patterns reliably across extended writing.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

### Objectives (2)
- EN-Y3-O037 [statutory]: use the diagonal and horizontal strokes that are needed to join letters and understand which letters, when adjacent to one another, are best left unjoined
- EN-Y3-O038 [statutory]: increase the legibility, consistency and quality of their handwriting [for example, by ensuring that the downstrokes of letters are parallel and equidistant; that lines of writing are spaced sufficiently so that the ascenders and descenders of letters do not touch]

## Domain: EN-Y3-D006 — Writing - Composition
**Subject:** English | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-8 | **Structure:** sequential

### Curriculum Context
Writing — composition at Year 3 develops pupils' ability to plan, draft and evaluate a wider range of text types for different purposes and audiences, with increasing awareness of the reader's needs. Pupils learn to organise writing into paragraphs to group related information, to use headings and sub-headings in non-fiction writing, and to develop settings, characters and plot in narrative. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to compose and rehearse sentences orally before writing them, to assess the effectiveness of their own and others' writing and suggest improvements, and to proofread for spelling and punctuation errors. The compositional demands at Year 3 are supported by extensive reading of high-quality texts that provide models of effective writing across different genres.

### Concepts (10)

#### EN-Y3-C044 — Planning writing from model texts
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils discuss writing similar to what they plan to write in order to understand and learn from its structure, vocabulary and grammar

**Teaching guidance:** Teach planning through exposure to model texts — children read and analyse high-quality examples of the text type they are going to write before planning their own. Use boxing-up (a grid showing the structure of the model text) to help children internalise the text's structure. Teach children to plan the purpose, audience, key content and structural organisation of their writing before they begin drafting. Model planning through shared writing, thinking aloud about the decisions being made.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may treat planning as copying out sections of the model text rather than using it as a structural template. They may spend too long on detailed plans that effectively become a first draft. Some children plan but then deviate significantly from their plan during writing, suggesting the planning was not purposeful.

**Key vocabulary:** plan, model text, purpose, audience, structure, boxing up, organise, key points, draft, prepare

#### EN-Y3-C045 — Generating and recording ideas
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils plan writing by discussing and recording ideas using brainstorming, planning frames or notes

**Teaching guidance:** Teach strategies for generating and recording ideas before writing. Use mind maps, brainstorms, lists, sketches and note-taking as pre-writing tools. Encourage children to draw on their reading, personal experience, research and imagination. Model the process of idea generation during shared writing: 'I could write about... or I could... What ideas do I have for the middle section?' Teach children that not all ideas generated will make it into the final piece — selecting and organising ideas is part of the writing process.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may feel they need a perfect idea before they can start, leading to 'writer's block'. They may record too many ideas and try to include all of them, resulting in unfocused writing. Some children skip the idea-generation stage entirely, writing the first thing that comes to mind.

**Key vocabulary:** ideas, brainstorm, mind map, notes, jot down, think, plan, generate, record, select, organise

#### EN-Y3-C046 — Oral rehearsal of sentences
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils compose and rehearse sentences orally including dialogue, progressively building varied and rich vocabulary and an increasing range of sentence structures

**Teaching guidance:** Teach oral rehearsal of sentences as a bridge between planning and writing. Before writing each sentence, children should say it aloud (to a partner or quietly to themselves), listening for grammatical sense, vocabulary choices and the flow of the sentence. In Year 3, extend from KS1 by rehearsing multi-clause sentences: 'When the storm began, the ship rocked violently.' Model oral rehearsal in shared writing, demonstrating how the same idea can be expressed in different ways and choosing the most effective version.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may rehearse a simple sentence but write a more complex one, or vice versa, because they lose track during the physical act of writing. They may rehearse silently rather than aloud, which reduces the effectiveness of the strategy. Some children see oral rehearsal as unnecessary and skip it, particularly when they are confident writers.

**Key vocabulary:** rehearse, say it first, sentence, aloud, listen, check, does it sound right, partner, compose

#### EN-Y3-C047 — Paragraphing in composition
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils organise writing into paragraphs around a theme, grouping related sentences together

**Teaching guidance:** Teach paragraphing as a way to group related material in both narrative and non-fiction writing. In narrative, teach that a new paragraph signals a change in time, place, topic or speaker. In non-fiction, teach that each paragraph deals with one main point. Model paragraph breaks during shared writing, explicitly explaining why a new paragraph is needed. Provide texts for children to divide into paragraphs and discuss where the breaks should fall and why.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may write entire texts as a single paragraph, not seeing the need for breaks. They may break paragraphs at arbitrary points (e.g., when they reach the edge of the page) rather than for organisational reasons. Some children understand the concept of paragraphs in non-fiction but struggle to apply it in narrative writing.

**Key vocabulary:** paragraph, group, related, topic, new line, indent, change, time, place, speaker, main point

#### EN-Y3-C048 — Narrative elements: setting, character and plot
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils develop key elements of story writing including describing settings, developing characters with distinct traits, and planning and writing story plots

**Teaching guidance:** Teach the three key elements of narrative: setting (where and when the story takes place), character (who the story is about), and plot (what happens — including a problem or conflict and its resolution). Use quality texts as models, identifying how authors establish setting through sensory description, develop characters through dialogue and action, and structure plot with tension and resolution. In Year 3, focus on creating detailed settings and developing characters beyond simple descriptions.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may rush past setting and character development to focus on action and events. They may describe characters only by physical appearance rather than personality, feelings and motivation. Some children create elaborate settings and characters but have weak or non-existent plot structures.

**Key vocabulary:** setting, character, plot, problem, resolution, describe, dialogue, action, tension, narrative, story

#### EN-Y3-C049 — Organisational devices in non-narrative writing
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils structure non-fiction writing using simple organisational devices such as headings and sub-headings

**Teaching guidance:** Teach children to use organisational devices in non-narrative writing: headings, subheadings, bullet points, numbered lists, text boxes, and diagrams. Show how these features help the reader navigate and understand information texts. Study model texts (information leaflets, non-fiction books, web pages) to identify how organisational devices are used. In shared writing, model deciding which organisational features are appropriate for the purpose and audience. Ensure children use these devices in their own non-fiction writing.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may add headings and subheadings as decorations after writing rather than using them to plan and organise content. They may use bullet points where continuous prose would be more appropriate, or vice versa. Some children create visually appealing layouts without ensuring the content underneath is well written.

**Key vocabulary:** heading, subheading, bullet point, list, diagram, caption, text box, label, organise, layout, feature

#### EN-Y3-C050 — Evaluating own and others' writing
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils assess the effectiveness of writing, identifying strengths and suggesting specific improvements

**Teaching guidance:** Develop peer evaluation skills by teaching children to give specific, constructive feedback. Provide evaluation frameworks: 'Two stars and a wish' (two things done well and one area for improvement), or success criteria checklists. Model giving feedback that is specific ('I liked the way you used the word shimmering to describe the water') rather than vague ('That was good'). Teach children to evaluate their own writing against the same criteria. Ensure that evaluation leads to action — children should use feedback to improve their work.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may focus evaluation on surface features (handwriting, length) rather than quality of content, structure and language. They may be reluctant to offer constructive criticism to peers, saying everything is 'good'. Some children can identify weaknesses in others' writing but not in their own.

**Key vocabulary:** evaluate, feedback, improve, strength, target, success criteria, specific, star, wish, effective

#### EN-Y3-C051 — Editing for grammar, vocabulary and consistency
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils propose changes to grammar and vocabulary to improve consistency, including accurate use of pronouns to avoid repetition

**Teaching guidance:** Teach editing as a distinct stage in the writing process where children improve their work by changing vocabulary, grammar and sentence structure for greater clarity and effect. Model editing during shared writing: read the draft aloud, identify a sentence that could be improved, and demonstrate how to revise it. Teach children to check for consistency of tense, pronoun reference and vocabulary register. Provide editing checklists tailored to the specific text type. Ensure children understand that editing improves content, while proof-reading corrects errors.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often conflate editing with proof-reading, focusing on correcting spelling and punctuation errors rather than improving the quality of writing. They may resist changing their work because they see the first draft as the finished product. Some children make edits that introduce new errors because they do not reread the revised version.

**Key vocabulary:** edit, improve, change, revise, vocabulary, grammar, sentence, consistency, tense, draft, better

#### EN-Y3-C052 — Proof-reading
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils check and correct spelling and punctuation mistakes by re-reading their writing

**Teaching guidance:** Teach proof-reading as the final stage of the writing process — checking for spelling, punctuation and grammatical errors. Model proof-reading techniques: reading aloud slowly, pointing to each word, using a ruler to read line by line, reading backwards to check spelling. Provide a proof-reading checklist: capital letters at sentence starts, full stops at sentence ends, correct use of apostrophes, spelling of exception words. Teach children to use a coloured pen for corrections so they can see what they have changed.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may skim-read their work and declare it error-free without careful checking. They may correct some errors but miss others because they read what they intended rather than what they wrote. Some children proof-read for one type of error at a time (which is actually good practice) but do not complete enough passes to catch all types.

**Key vocabulary:** proof-read, check, correct, spelling, punctuation, error, mistake, capital letter, full stop, fix

#### EN-Y3-C053 — Reading aloud own writing
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils present their writing orally with appropriate intonation, tone and volume so that meaning is clear to a group or the whole class

**Teaching guidance:** Provide regular opportunities for children to read their own writing aloud to different audiences — partners, small groups and the whole class. Teach children to use appropriate intonation, volume and pace that reflect the meaning and mood of their writing. Use peer response: after a child reads aloud, their partner identifies something specific they enjoyed. Connect reading aloud to the editing process — hearing their own writing often helps children identify where improvements are needed.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may read their own writing in a flat monotone because they are focused on decoding their own handwriting. They may read too fast, particularly when nervous about performing in front of peers. Some children change their writing as they read aloud (ad-libbing improvements) rather than reading what is actually written on the page.

**Key vocabulary:** read aloud, perform, audience, intonation, expression, volume, pace, share, respond, feedback

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**EN-Y3-D006-CL001:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Planning from model texts involves analysing how those texts are structured and understanding that the organisational choices serve the writer's purpose — pupils abstract structural patterns to use in their own writing.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Oral rehearsal and generating/recording ideas introduce pupils to the drafting process as a reusable template — a procedural pattern (plan, rehearse, draft) that scaffolds the writing process.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**EN-Y3-D006-CL002:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Paragraphing, narrative elements and non-fiction organisational devices are all about how structure serves meaning — pupils learn that grouping related ideas, building setting/character/plot, and using headings each fulfil a specific compositional function.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Narrative structure (beginning/build-up/climax/resolution) and non-fiction text organisation are genre patterns that pupils learn to recognise in models and replicate in their own writing.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**EN-Y3-D006-CL003:**
- **Evidence and Argument** (primary): What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Evaluating and editing own writing requires pupils to assess their text against criteria — using what is on the page as evidence of whether the writing achieves its purpose, then acting on that judgement.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'
- **Perspective and Interpretation**: Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?
  Why: Reading aloud with expression and evaluating writing from the perspective of an audience requires pupils to adopt the reader's viewpoint and ask whether the intended effect is achieved.
  AI instruction: Use the PERSPECTIVE AND INTERPRETATION lens: prompt pupils to identify the author's or actor's viewpoint, consider what information or experience shapes that perspective, look for omissions or contradictions, and compare multiple accounts. Useful questions: 'Who wrote/said this, and why?', 'What might they have left out?', 'How would someone else see this differently?', 'What would change your view?'

## Domain: EN-Y3-D007 — Writing - Vocabulary, Grammar and Punctuation
**Subject:** English | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-8 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Vocabulary, grammar and punctuation at Year 3 introduces pupils to more complex sentence structures and extends their grammatical vocabulary, building on the sentence-level work of KS1. Pupils learn to express time, place and cause using conjunctions, adverbs and prepositions, to use fronted adverbials and understand when to use commas after them, and to use inverted commas for direct speech. The statutory curriculum introduces pupils to new grammatical terms: fronted adverbial, determiner, pronoun, possessive pronoun, and adverbial. The teaching of grammar at this stage is always embedded in meaningful writing contexts, with pupils learning to use new structures not just to recognise them, and evaluating the effect of grammatical choices on the reader.

### Concepts (13)

#### EN-Y3-C054 — Multi-clause sentences with conjunctions
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 2

Pupils extend sentences with more than one clause using a wider range of conjunctions including when, if, because, although, creating subordinate clauses

**Teaching guidance:** Teach children to write multi-clause sentences using co-ordinating conjunctions (and, but, or, so) and subordinating conjunctions (when, if, because, that, although, while, after, before, until). Model combining short sentences into multi-clause sentences during shared writing. Teach children to vary their sentence structure — not every sentence needs to be multi-clause. Practise converting simple sentences into compound or complex sentences and vice versa. Use sentence-combining activities with sets of short sentences.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may overuse multi-clause sentences, creating sprawling constructions that lose clarity. They may default to one conjunction (usually 'and' or 'because') without varying their repertoire. Some children write multi-clause sentences without proper punctuation, particularly missing commas after fronted subordinate clauses.

**Key vocabulary:** clause, multi-clause, conjunction, and, but, because, when, if, although, join, combine, sentence

#### EN-Y3-C055 — Present perfect tense
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils understand and use the present perfect form of verbs (have/has + past participle) in contrast to the simple past tense, understanding the difference in meaning

**Teaching guidance:** Teach the present perfect tense as a way of expressing something that started in the past and continues to the present, or something completed at an unspecified time in the past. Contrast with the simple past: 'He went to town' (simple past — finished action) vs 'He has gone to town' (present perfect — he is still there). Use the formula: has/have + past participle. Practise converting between simple past and present perfect. Address irregular past participles (gone, seen, taken, written) alongside regular ones (walked, played).

**Common misconceptions:** Children commonly use the simple past where the present perfect is needed (e.g., 'I already did it' instead of 'I have already done it'). They may confuse the present perfect with the simple past because both refer to past events. Some children use 'has went' or 'have went' instead of 'has gone' or 'have gone', reflecting non-standard dialect influence.

**Key vocabulary:** present perfect, has, have, past participle, tense, simple past, -ed, gone, seen, taken, done

#### EN-Y3-C056 — Pronoun choice for cohesion
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils choose nouns or pronouns appropriately for clarity and cohesion, avoiding repetition and ensuring pronoun references are clear

**Teaching guidance:** Teach that pronouns replace nouns to avoid repetition and create cohesion in writing. Model the problem of not using pronouns: 'Sarah went to the shop. Sarah bought some bread. Sarah walked home.' Then show how pronouns improve the text: 'Sarah went to the shop. She bought some bread. She walked home.' Teach children to choose pronouns carefully so the reader always knows who or what is being referred to. Introduce possessive pronouns (his, her, their, its) alongside personal pronouns.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often use pronouns ambiguously, making it unclear which noun the pronoun refers to (e.g., 'Tom and Jack went out. He fell over.' — who fell?). They may over-use names instead of pronouns, creating repetitive writing. Some children use the wrong pronoun form ('him went' instead of 'he went').

**Key vocabulary:** pronoun, he, she, it, they, him, her, them, replace, noun, cohesion, reference, who, clear

#### EN-Y3-C057 — Conjunctions, adverbs and prepositions for time and cause
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils use conjunctions (when, before, after, while, so, because), adverbs (then, next, soon, therefore) and prepositions (before, after, during, in, because of) to express time, place and cause

**Teaching guidance:** Teach conjunctions (when, before, after, while, because, so), adverbs (then, next, soon, therefore) and prepositions (before, after, during, in, because of) as tools for expressing time, cause and effect. Show how these words link events and ideas: 'The road was icy. She slipped.' → 'Because the road was icy, she slipped.' / 'She slipped because the road was icy.' Practise using different connectives to express the same relationship. Create a classroom display of time and cause connectives for reference during writing.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may use 'because' as their only causal connective, not varying their language. They may confuse temporal and causal connectives (e.g., using 'when' where 'because' is needed). Some children start sentences with connectives but do not complete the grammatical structure (e.g., 'Because the rain.' as a complete sentence).

**Key vocabulary:** conjunction, adverb, preposition, time, cause, because, when, before, after, while, then, so

#### EN-Y3-C058 — Fronted adverbials
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils place adverbials at the start of sentences for effect (e.g. Later that day, I heard the bad news.) and use commas after fronted adverbials

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce fronted adverbials in Year 3 as a sentence-opening device that adds variety and detail. Teach that a fronted adverbial is a word or phrase at the start of a sentence that tells the reader when, where or how something happened, followed by a comma: 'Slowly, the door creaked open.' 'After lunch, we went outside.' 'In the dark forest, a wolf waited.' Model adding fronted adverbials to plain sentences in shared writing. Practise through sentence-level activities before applying in extended writing.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may forget the comma after a fronted adverbial. They may overuse fronted adverbials, starting every sentence with one, which becomes repetitive. Some children confuse fronted adverbials with conjunctions and create sentence fragments. Others use only time adverbials ('First,... Then,... Next,...') rather than varying with place and manner.

**Key vocabulary:** fronted adverbial, adverbial, comma, sentence opener, when, where, how, time, place, manner

#### EN-Y3-C059 — Direct speech punctuation
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils use and punctuate direct speech correctly, beginning with introduction to inverted commas (speech marks) and basic speech punctuation conventions

**Teaching guidance:** Teach direct speech punctuation using the conventions: inverted commas (speech marks) around the spoken words, a new speaker on a new line, a comma or other punctuation before the closing speech mark, and a reporting clause (he said, she asked). Model with examples from class texts. Begin with simple reporting structures ('Hello,' said Tom.) before introducing variations (Tom said, 'Hello.' / 'Hello,' said Tom, 'how are you?'). Use drama to generate dialogue that children then write up with correct punctuation.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often forget to open or close speech marks, particularly when a sentence of dialogue is long. They may not place the comma before the closing speech mark. Some children do not start a new line for each new speaker, making dialogue difficult to follow. Others punctuate reported speech as if it were direct speech.

**Key vocabulary:** speech marks, inverted commas, dialogue, said, asked, replied, reporting clause, spoken words, new line

#### EN-Y3-C060 — Noun formation using prefixes
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils understand how prefixes create new nouns, particularly super- (supermarket, superstar), anti- (antiseptic, antisocial) and auto- (autobiography, autograph)

**Teaching guidance:** Teach how prefixes can be used to create nouns from other word classes: super- (superhero), anti- (antiseptic), auto- (autobiography). Demonstrate the pattern: identify the root word, add the prefix, note how the meaning changes. Connect to vocabulary development by exploring how these prefixes create words with specific meanings. Use word-building activities where children combine prefixes with root words to create and define new nouns. Link to reading comprehension — understanding these prefixes helps children decode unfamiliar vocabulary.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may not realise that the prefix changes the meaning systematically (e.g., 'anti-' always means 'against'). They may confuse word-class changes from prefixes with those from suffixes. Some children add prefixes to words where they do not apply, creating non-existent words.

**Key vocabulary:** prefix, noun, word formation, super-, anti-, auto-, meaning, root word, create, derive

#### EN-Y3-C061 — Articles a/an
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 1 | Teaching weight: 1 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils correctly choose between the articles 'a' and 'an' according to whether the next word begins with a consonant or vowel sound

**Teaching guidance:** Teach the rule for choosing between the indefinite articles 'a' and 'an': use 'a' before a consonant sound and 'an' before a vowel sound. Emphasise that the rule is about sound, not spelling: 'an hour' (silent h), 'a uniform' (y sound), 'an umbrella' (vowel sound). Provide practice exercises where children choose the correct article for given words. Connect to speaking — most children already use 'a' and 'an' correctly in speech and can transfer this knowledge to writing by saying the phrase aloud.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may apply the rule based on the letter rather than the sound, writing 'an uniform' or 'a hour'. They may not realise that words beginning with 'h' can take either article depending on pronunciation. Some children omit articles entirely, particularly children whose home language does not use articles.

**Key vocabulary:** article, a, an, consonant sound, vowel sound, before, indefinite article, choose, rule

#### EN-Y3-C062 — Word families
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils understand word families based on common words, showing how words are related in form and meaning (e.g. solve, solution, solver, dissolve, insoluble)

**Teaching guidance:** Teach word families as groups of words that share a common root word (e.g., solve, solution, dissolve, resolver, insoluble). Show how the root carries a consistent meaning across all words in the family. Use word family trees or webs as visual displays. When encountering unfamiliar words in reading, prompt children to identify whether the word belongs to a family they already know. Connect word families to spelling — knowing one word in a family often helps spell others.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may group words that look similar but are not actually related (e.g., 'play' and 'player' are related, but 'play' and 'place' are not). They may confuse word families with rhyming families. Some children understand word families in isolation but do not apply this knowledge as a reading or spelling strategy.

**Key vocabulary:** word family, root word, related, connect, group, derive, base, same root, meaning, pattern

#### EN-Y3-C063 — Paragraphs to group related material
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils understand paragraphs as a way to group related material, introduced as an organisational concept in Year 3

**Teaching guidance:** Teach paragraphing as an organisational tool for grouping related material. In non-fiction, model how each paragraph focuses on one aspect of the topic, with a topic sentence that introduces the main idea. In fiction, teach the TIPTOP rule for starting new paragraphs: Time change, Introduce a new character, Place change, Topic change, Opposite (change of focus). Provide texts for children to divide into paragraphs, discussing the reasons for each break. Model paragraph structure explicitly during shared writing.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may understand that paragraphs exist but not know when to start a new one. They may create very uneven paragraphs — one or two very long paragraphs and several very short ones. Some children insert paragraph breaks mechanically (e.g., every five sentences) rather than according to content.

**Key vocabulary:** paragraph, topic, group, related, organise, main idea, topic sentence, new paragraph, TIPTOP, indent

#### EN-Y3-C064 — Headings and sub-headings
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Pupils understand and use headings and sub-headings to aid presentation and organise information texts

**Teaching guidance:** Teach headings and subheadings as organisational tools that help readers navigate non-fiction texts. Model how to write clear, informative headings that tell the reader what a section is about. Analyse model texts: cover up the headings and ask children to predict what each section will contain based on the heading. In shared writing, compose texts where children suggest appropriate headings and subheadings. Teach the difference between headings (main topics) and subheadings (subtopics within a section).

**Common misconceptions:** Children may write vague or unhelpful headings (e.g., 'Stuff' or 'Part 2' instead of 'How Volcanoes Erupt'). They may not understand the hierarchical relationship between headings and subheadings. Some children add headings after writing rather than using them to plan and organise content.

**Key vocabulary:** heading, subheading, title, section, topic, organise, navigation, reader, information, non-fiction

#### EN-Y3-C065 — Year 3 grammatical terminology
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 2

Pupils learn and use Year 3 grammatical terminology accurately: preposition, conjunction, word family, prefix, clause, subordinate clause, direct speech, consonant, consonant letter, vowel, vowel letter, inverted commas

**Teaching guidance:** Teach the Year 3 grammatical terminology from Appendix 2: preposition, conjunction, word family, prefix, clause, subordinate clause, direct speech, consonant, consonant letter, vowel, vowel letter, inverted commas (speech marks). Teach each term in context, using it when discussing reading and writing. Display definitions with examples. Practise identifying these features in texts. Test understanding through activities like 'find the preposition in this sentence' or 'underline the subordinate clause'.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may learn the definitions of grammatical terms without being able to identify examples in context. They may confuse prepositions with conjunctions when both can express similar meanings (e.g., 'before the match' vs 'before the match started'). Some children know the terms but cannot explain their function in a sentence.

**Key vocabulary:** preposition, conjunction, word family, prefix, clause, subordinate clause, direct speech, inverted commas

#### EN-Y3-C066 — Standard English awareness
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Pupils begin to understand differences between Standard English and non-Standard English and start to apply Standard English in writing, for example in dialogue

**Teaching guidance:** Continue developing awareness of Standard English, focusing on subject-verb agreement and common non-standard forms. Address the specific verb forms that differ in many dialects: 'we were' not 'we was'; 'I did' not 'I done'; 'she saw' not 'she seen'; 'they went' not 'they gone'. Approach sensitively, validating dialect as appropriate in informal spoken contexts while teaching that Standard English is expected in writing and formal speech. Use editing activities where children identify and correct non-standard verb forms in written text.

**Common misconceptions:** Children may feel that their dialect is being criticised when Standard English is taught, requiring a sensitive approach that values linguistic diversity. They may apply Standard English forms inconsistently, particularly in verbs that are common in non-standard dialect (e.g., 'done' for 'did'). Some children can identify non-standard forms in others' writing but not in their own.

**Key vocabulary:** Standard English, grammar, verb, correct form, formal, writing, we were, I did, she saw, agreement

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**EN-Y3-D007-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Multi-clause conjunctions, fronted adverbials and direct speech punctuation are grammatical patterns with consistent structural forms — pupils learn each as a rule-governed template for extending and varying sentence structure.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Structure and Function**: How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Understanding why fronted adverbials and direct speech are punctuated as they are requires seeing punctuation as serving structural functions: the comma after a fronted adverbial signals the boundary between frame and main clause.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'

**EN-Y3-D007-CL002:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Present perfect tense, pronoun reference and Standard English verb agreement are grammatical patterns — each follows a system of rules that pupils must internalise for consistent accurate application.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Structure and Function**: How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Pronoun choice for cohesion is explicitly a structure-function skill: pronoun selection is a structural choice that functions to maintain referential clarity across a text without repetition.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'

**EN-Y3-D007-CL003:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Word families and prefix-based noun formation are morphological patterns — recognising that 'sign', 'signal', 'signature' share a root allows pupils to infer meaning and spelling through pattern extension.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**EN-Y3-D007-CL004:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Paragraphs, headings and sub-headings are text-organisation structures that serve the function of guiding the reader and grouping related information — the cognitive task is understanding why these devices are used, not just recognising them.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'

## Domain: MA-Y3-D001 — Number - Number and Place Value
**Subject:** Mathematics | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-8 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
In lower key stage 2, the principal focus of mathematics teaching is to ensure that pupils become increasingly fluent with whole numbers and the four operations, including number facts and the concept of place value. In Year 3, pupils extend their understanding of the number system from two-digit numbers (explored in KS1) to three-digit numbers, developing secure knowledge of the hundreds, tens and ones structure. The non-statutory guidance emphasises that pupils should use a variety of representations including the number line to practise counting in fours, eights, fifties and hundreds, and should connect their new knowledge of the number system to measurement — for example, linking counting in 50s to amounts on a scale. Pupils who understand place value in three-digit numbers are equipped to undertake the mental and written arithmetic that is central to the rest of Year 3 mathematics, and this domain forms the essential prerequisite for the four-digit work of Year 4.

### Concepts (11)

#### MA-Y3-C001 — Counting in multiples of 4
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Counting in multiples of 4 (4, 8, 12, 16, 20...) builds on counting in twos from KS1 and prepares pupils for the 4 times table. Pupils must be able to count forwards and backwards in fours from any multiple of four, not just from zero. Mastery means a pupil can continue or start a count in fours from any given multiple without needing to recite the sequence from the beginning, and can connect counting in fours to the doubling relationship with twos.

**Teaching guidance:** Begin with concrete groups of 4 objects (four counting bears, four cubes) physically grouped and counted. Use a number line or hundred square with multiples of 4 highlighted to provide a pictorial representation. Connect explicitly to the 2 times table: 'double 2 is 4, so counting in fours is like counting in twos twice.' Practise from different starting points (not always from zero) and in both directions. Use chanting and rhythmic counting, but ensure pupils can also respond to 'what comes after 28?' without reciting from the start.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often count in fours confidently starting from zero but stumble when asked to continue from a mid-sequence multiple (e.g. 'keep counting from 20'). Some pupils confuse multiples of 4 with multiples of 2 and say 2, 4, 6 when asked to count in fours. When counting backwards in fours, pupils frequently revert to counting back in ones.

**Key vocabulary:** multiple, count in fours, four times table, skip count, sequence, pattern

#### MA-Y3-C002 — Counting in multiples of 8
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Counting in multiples of 8 (8, 16, 24, 32...) is the most challenging skip-counting sequence introduced in Year 3 and is directly connected to the 8 times table. Pupils must be able to count forwards and backwards in eights from any multiple. Mastery means a pupil can recite the sequence fluently, continue it from any starting multiple, and understand the doubling relationship linking the 4 and 8 times tables.

**Teaching guidance:** Use the doubling connection: first consolidate counting in fours, then demonstrate that each multiple of 8 is double the corresponding multiple of 4 (4 → 8, 8 → 16, 12 → 24). A number line showing multiples of 4 with the multiples of 8 highlighted makes this relationship visual. Repeated doubling (starting from 1: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64...) is a powerful pattern to explore. Use contexts where 8 is natural: spiders' legs, octopus arms, 8-shaped athletics tracks.

**Common misconceptions:** Counting in eights is hard because the multiples (8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80...) do not have as obvious a visual pattern on a hundred square as multiples of 5 or 10. Pupils frequently lose their place in the sequence and resort to counting in ones. The transition from 32 to 40 and from 72 to 80 are particularly error-prone.

**Key vocabulary:** multiple, count in eights, eight times table, skip count, doubling, sequence

#### MA-Y3-C003 — Counting in multiples of 50
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Counting in multiples of 50 (50, 100, 150, 200...) connects to the 5 times table and understanding of amounts on scales and in money. Pupils must count forwards and backwards in 50s beyond 1000 if needed. Mastery means a pupil can count fluently in 50s from different starting points and connect this to reading scale marks on measurement instruments showing 50ml, 50g, 50cm etc.

**Teaching guidance:** Connect to the 5 times table: 5 × 10 = 50, so each multiple of 50 is a multiple of 5 scaled by 10. Use a number line marked in 50s. Connect to money (50p coins, £1 = two 50p coins) and measurement contexts (a weighing scale with 50g gradations). Show that counting in 50s is like counting in 5s but with an extra zero on the end of each number. Practise in both directions: 200, 150, 100, 50, 0.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils sometimes say 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 310 (adding only 10 at some points). The transition across hundreds boundaries (e.g. 350, 400) occasionally causes pupils to add only 50 to the tens digit rather than to the whole number.

**Key vocabulary:** fifty, multiple, count in fifties, sequence, scale

#### MA-Y3-C004 — Counting in multiples of 100
Type: skill | Complexity: 1 | Teaching weight: 1 | Fan-out: 1

Counting in multiples of 100 (100, 200, 300...) reinforces the structure of the number system and the hundreds place in place value. Pupils must count fluently forwards and backwards in hundreds up to at least 1000. Mastery means a pupil can count in hundreds without hesitation, identify any given multiple of 100 on a number line, and connect this to the hundreds digit in three-digit numbers.

**Teaching guidance:** Connect to the understanding of hundreds as a unit. Use a number line from 0 to 1000 marked in hundreds. Use Dienes/base-ten blocks: each flat (hundred block) represents one 100. Count the blocks as they are added or removed. Connect to knowledge of the 10 times table: 10 × 10 = 100, so multiples of 100 are multiples of the 10 times table scaled by 10.

**Common misconceptions:** Most pupils count in hundreds easily from zero, but may struggle to count backward (1000, 900, 800...) particularly across the 0 boundary. Some pupils believe you cannot count below zero in hundreds, not knowing about negative numbers. When asked for 100 more than 950, some pupils say 1050 incorrectly (adding an extra zero) rather than 1050 correctly.

**Key vocabulary:** hundred, multiple of 100, three-digit number, place value, number line

#### MA-Y3-C005 — Finding 10 more and 10 less
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Finding 10 more or 10 less than any given three-digit number requires understanding that only the tens digit changes (e.g. 246 + 10 = 256). This extends the KS1 skill of finding 10 more/less with two-digit numbers to the three-digit range. Mastery means a pupil can instantly identify 10 more/less than any three-digit number, including those where the tens digit reaches 0 or 9 (requiring the hundreds digit to change).

**Teaching guidance:** Use a 0-1000 number line with clear decade markings. Dienes blocks are powerful: adding a ten-stick shows the change physically. A hundred square extended to show three-digit numbers helps pupils see the pattern. Focus on the boundary cases: 10 more than 190 is 200 (the tens digit overflows into the hundreds); 10 less than 200 is 190 (borrowing from the hundreds). Practise with rapid-fire questions.

**Common misconceptions:** When the tens digit is 9, pupils often say 10 more than 196 is 1096 (adding a 1 in front) or 196 + 10 = 1,106. When the tens digit is 0, pupils may say 10 less than 300 is 390 rather than 290. These boundary errors reveal incomplete understanding of how carrying and borrowing work with hundreds.

**Key vocabulary:** ten more, ten less, tens digit, hundreds digit, increase, decrease, partition

#### MA-Y3-C006 — Finding 100 more and 100 less
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Finding 100 more or 100 less than any three-digit number requires understanding that only the hundreds digit changes (e.g. 346 + 100 = 446). This extends directly from finding 10 more/less by one column of place value. Mastery means a pupil can instantly identify 100 more or 100 less, including at boundaries such as 100 more than 900 = 1000.

**Teaching guidance:** Use Dienes blocks: adding a hundreds flat to a three-digit number shows the change physically. Connect to the hundred square pattern (one row down = 10 more; one full square = 100 more conceptually). Emphasise that the tens and ones digits do not change. Target the boundary: 100 more than 900 crosses into four digits (1000), which is an exciting moment to discuss. Practise in both directions.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often change the wrong digit: for 100 more than 324, some say 424 (correct) but others say 334 (changed tens) or 325 (changed ones). The boundary case of 100 more than 900 = 1000 can confuse pupils who think four-digit numbers do not exist yet.

**Key vocabulary:** hundred more, hundred less, hundreds digit, partition, place value, boundary

#### MA-Y3-C007 — Place value in three-digit numbers **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 5

Understanding that each digit in a three-digit number has a specific value determined by its position — hundreds, tens or ones — is the core of place value for Year 3. For example, in 347, the 3 represents 300, the 4 represents 40 and the 7 represents 7. Mastery means pupils can identify the value of any digit in a three-digit number, partition the number in standard form (347 = 300 + 40 + 7), and use this understanding to support all calculation strategies.

**Teaching guidance:** Use base-ten (Dienes) blocks as the primary concrete resource: hundreds flats, tens sticks and ones cubes model each place value position physically. Place value mats with columns for H, T and O support structured partitioning. Arrow cards (separate cards for 300, 40, 7 that slot together to form 347) show how digits combine and separate. Progress to place value charts and then to abstract representation. Always connect to the spoken number name.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils frequently confuse the digit with its value — saying the digit 3 in 347 'is worth 3' rather than 300. Pupils with insecure understanding may add the digits (3 + 4 + 7 = 14) rather than partitioning them. Zero as a place holder causes particular difficulty: in 307, the zero means 'no tens', but pupils often omit it when writing the number or misread it as 37.

**Key vocabulary:** hundreds, tens, ones, units, place value, digit, three-digit number, partition, value, represent

#### MA-Y3-C008 — Partitioning three-digit numbers
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Partitioning is the process of splitting a number into its component parts according to place value (e.g. 347 = 300 + 40 + 7). In Year 3, pupils extend this from two-digit to three-digit numbers and also practise flexible (non-standard) partitioning (e.g. 347 = 300 + 47 or 270 + 77). Mastery means pupils can partition any three-digit number in multiple ways and use partitioning as a mental calculation strategy.

**Teaching guidance:** Arrow cards and Dienes blocks remain the most powerful tools. After establishing standard partitioning, introduce flexible partitioning through practical problems: if I have 3 hundreds and 14 tens, what number is that? Discuss: 3 hundreds and 14 tens = 3 hundreds + 1 hundred + 4 tens = 4 hundreds + 4 tens = 440. Flexible partitioning is directly needed for mental addition and subtraction strategies, so teaching it in that context makes the purpose clear.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils can usually do standard partitioning but struggle with flexible partitioning (e.g. they cannot see that 347 = 300 + 47 = 250 + 97). They may also partition in writing but not connect it to mental arithmetic strategies. Some pupils think each partition is a different number rather than different ways of expressing the same number.

**Key vocabulary:** partition, split, hundreds, tens, ones, standard, flexible, parts, whole, compose, decompose

#### MA-Y3-C009 — Comparing and ordering numbers to 1000
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 2

Comparing numbers to 1000 involves using the language and symbols of inequality (greater than >, less than <, equal to =) to express the relationship between pairs of numbers. Ordering extends this to arranging multiple numbers in ascending or descending sequence. Mastery means pupils can compare any two three-digit numbers and explain their reasoning using place value, and can order sets of up to six numbers to 1000.

**Teaching guidance:** Use a number line from 0 to 1000 as the primary visual tool — the relative positions of numbers on the line make their order evident. Teach pupils to compare hundreds digits first, then tens, then ones — a systematic strategy. Use symbols > and < with the 'hungry crocodile always eats the bigger number' mnemonic if helpful, but ensure understanding precedes the symbol. Present numbers in random order and ask pupils to arrange them, explaining their reasoning aloud.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils sometimes compare by number of digits only (correctly seeing 999 > 100) but then fail when all numbers have the same number of digits (comparing 456 and 465). They may compare the first digits correctly then stop, not realising they need to move to the next column when the hundreds are equal. The symbols > and < are frequently confused with each other.

**Key vocabulary:** greater than, less than, equal to, compare, order, ascending, descending, sequence, symbol, >, <, =

#### MA-Y3-C010 — Estimating numbers to 1000
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 2

Estimation of numbers involves making a sensible approximation of a quantity or position based on available information, without precise counting. In Year 3, this includes estimating where a number appears on a partly-labelled number line and estimating quantities shown in images. Mastery means a pupil can give a reasonable estimate with appropriate reasoning (e.g. 'It's about halfway between 400 and 500, so I estimate 450') and understands that an estimate is not a guess.

**Teaching guidance:** Use partially labelled number lines (e.g. marked only at 0 and 1000, or at 0, 500 and 1000) and ask pupils to place numbers on them or identify values at marked positions. Compare estimation skills with measurement contexts — estimation is used before measuring to check for reasonableness. Discuss what makes a good estimate and how to improve the process (using benchmarks like halfway points). Connect to rounding in Year 4: estimation to the nearest 100 or 10 is the precursor.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils confuse estimation with guessing (no reasoning involved) or with an exact answer (too precise). They may estimate numbers on a 0-1000 number line without using known benchmarks (e.g. not using the midpoint 500 as an anchor). Some pupils are reluctant to estimate because they feel they might be wrong, not understanding that a reasonable estimate is always acceptable.

**Key vocabulary:** estimate, approximately, about, roughly, nearly, reasonable, benchmark, halfway, number line

#### MA-Y3-C011 — Reading and writing numbers to 1000 in words
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Pupils must be able to read and write in words any number up to 1000, including those with zero in a place value position (e.g. three hundred and seven, four hundred and fifty). Mastery means a pupil can convert fluently between numeral and word forms in both directions without errors, applying appropriate hyphenation and the word 'and' correctly.

**Teaching guidance:** Build systematically from hundreds: 'three hundred', then 'three hundred and forty', then 'three hundred and forty-seven'. Teach the rule that 'and' appears between hundreds and the rest (British English convention). Highlight hyphenation for compound tens (twenty-one, forty-seven). Special attention to 'eleven' through 'nineteen' as these are irregular. Post a reference chart of ones and teens words. Zero in the tens place requires 'and [ones]' (three hundred and seven, not three hundred and zero seven).

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils frequently omit 'and' (writing 'three hundred forty-seven' rather than 'three hundred and forty-seven'). They may write the number of hundreds as a single digit prefix ('3 hundred forty-seven'). Numbers with zero in the tens column cause particular confusion: some write 'three hundred zero seven' or omit the zero entirely and write 'three hundred seven' which is ambiguous.

**Key vocabulary:** hundred, thousand, and, hyphen, numeral, word form, spell, write, read

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**MA-Y3-D001-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Sequences and functions are formalised patterns — pupils identify the underlying rule, express it algebraically, and use it to predict terms or outputs.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Algebraic relationships encode causal structure: changing the input (x) causes a predictable change in the output (y), making cause-and-effect reasoning natural here.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

**MA-Y3-D001-CL002:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Place value is the positional pattern in our base-10 number system — pupils recognise how each digit's value follows a regular, predictable rule they can extend indefinitely.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Scale, Proportion and Quantity**: How big, how many, or how much — and how does that change how we think about it?
  Why: Understanding that each place is ten times the previous introduces the multiplicative structure of our number system — a fundamentally proportional idea.
  AI instruction: Use the SCALE, PROPORTION AND QUANTITY lens: prompt pupils to compare quantities using ratios and percentages, consider what changes when scale changes, and choose appropriate units of measurement. Useful questions: 'How many times bigger?', 'What fraction of the whole?', 'What changes when we zoom in/out?', 'Which units fit best here?'

**MA-Y3-D001-CL003:**
- **Scale, Proportion and Quantity** (primary): How big, how many, or how much — and how does that change how we think about it?
  Why: This cluster is fundamentally about proportional reasoning — how quantities relate multiplicatively and how ratios and fractions describe relative size.
  AI instruction: Use the SCALE, PROPORTION AND QUANTITY lens: prompt pupils to compare quantities using ratios and percentages, consider what changes when scale changes, and choose appropriate units of measurement. Useful questions: 'How many times bigger?', 'What fraction of the whole?', 'What changes when we zoom in/out?', 'Which units fit best here?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Proportional relationships follow predictable patterns (doubling one quantity doubles the other) that pupils can identify and use to solve problems.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

## Domain: MA-Y3-D002 — Number - Addition and Subtraction
**Subject:** Mathematics | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-8 | **Structure:** sequential

### Curriculum Context
In Year 3, pupils are introduced to formal written methods of columnar addition and subtraction for the first time, building on the expanded methods practised in Year 2. The non-statutory guidance specifies that pupils practise solving varied addition and subtraction questions, and should be introduced to the formal written methods of columnar addition and subtraction — including where carrying (addition) and decomposition (subtraction) are required. Pupils continue to develop their mental arithmetic alongside written methods, ensuring they have the flexibility to choose the most efficient approach for a given calculation. Estimation before calculating and checking using the inverse operation are statutory requirements that build pupils' number sense and self-monitoring, preparing them for the multi-step problems and larger numbers encountered in Years 4 to 6.

### Concepts (5)

#### MA-Y3-C012 — Mental addition with three-digit numbers
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Mental addition in Year 3 includes adding a three-digit number and ones, a three-digit number and tens, or a three-digit number and hundreds, without using formal written methods. This extends the KS1 mental strategies to a larger range of numbers. Mastery means pupils can perform these mental calculations with confidence, choosing between partitioning, counting on, and known facts as the most efficient strategy for each problem.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach partitioning the smaller number: to add 247 + 30, think '247 + 30 = 247 + 30 = 277' (adding to the tens column only). Sequence instruction: ones first (no carrying difficulties), then tens (possible carrying into hundreds), then hundreds (the least complex as it affects only the hundreds digit). Number lines and hundred squares remain useful pictorial supports. Emphasise choosing the most efficient strategy: 356 + 400 is more efficient as adding hundreds mentally than using a written method.

**Common misconceptions:** When adding ones to a three-digit number, pupils sometimes forget to carry into the tens: 347 + 6 becomes 3413 (concatenating digits) rather than 353. When adding tens, some pupils also change the ones digit. The most common error is 'adding the wrong column': pupils add 30 to the hundreds digit rather than the tens.

**Key vocabulary:** add, mental arithmetic, strategy, partition, count on, ones, tens, hundreds, carrying, sum, total

#### MA-Y3-C013 — Mental subtraction with three-digit numbers
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Mental subtraction in Year 3 parallels the addition work, covering subtracting ones, tens or hundreds from a three-digit number. This includes bridging cases (e.g. 352 – 7 requires borrowing from the tens). Mastery means pupils can perform mental subtraction efficiently and choose appropriately between counting back, partitioning and complementary addition strategies.

**Teaching guidance:** Use number lines (counting back or counting up as complementary addition) as a concrete/pictorial bridge. Teach pupils to check whether subtraction crosses a tens or hundreds boundary and adjust strategy accordingly. Complementary addition ('counting on from the smaller to the larger') is particularly effective when the two numbers are close. Connect to inverse operations: use addition to check subtraction answers.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often subtract the smaller digit from the larger regardless of position — computing 352 – 7 as 355 (taking 5 from 7 gives 2, putting 2 in the ones place) which is incorrect. This 'smaller from larger' error also appears in written methods. Pupils may also forget that subtracting a ten from a number ending in zero requires borrowing (300 – 40 = 260, not 360).

**Key vocabulary:** subtract, take away, difference, counting back, count on, bridge, borrow, exchange, ones, tens, hundreds

#### MA-Y3-C014 — Formal columnar addition **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 3

Columnar addition is the formal written method for adding numbers of multiple digits, working right to left through the ones, tens and hundreds columns, carrying any value of 10 or more into the next column. In Year 3, this is introduced for numbers with up to three digits. Mastery means pupils can correctly set out a column addition, carry accurately between columns, and produce a correct answer for any three-digit addition.

**Teaching guidance:** Build from the expanded method (see Year 2) to the compact method. The CPA progression: first use Dienes blocks physically regrouping 10 ones into 1 ten and placing it in the tens column; then draw these exchanges pictorially; then record the compact method. Emphasise correct alignment — use squared paper or printed grids initially. Teach carrying explicitly: the small digit written above the next column represents the value carried. Model 'hundreds + hundreds, tens + tens, ones + ones, then deal with carries'.

**Common misconceptions:** The most common error is forgetting to add the carried digit. Pupils also frequently misalign columns when numbers have different numbers of digits. Some pupils add all digits as if they had equal value (treating 247 + 135 as 2+1=3, 4+3=7, 7+5=12 giving 3712 rather than setting up columns properly). Zero as a placeholder causes alignment errors.

**Key vocabulary:** column, addition, carry, exchange, regroup, hundreds, tens, ones, digit, align, place value

#### MA-Y3-C015 — Formal columnar subtraction
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Columnar subtraction is the formal written method for subtracting numbers, working right to left and exchanging (borrowing) from the next column when needed. In Year 3, this is introduced for three-digit subtraction. Mastery means pupils can correctly exchange between columns, complete any three-digit subtraction using the formal method, and check their answer using addition.

**Teaching guidance:** Begin with Dienes blocks: when there are not enough ones to subtract, exchange a tens rod for 10 ones cubes — physically model the exchange. Draw this pictorially. Then show how the exchange is recorded in the compact method (crossing out a digit and increasing the value in the ones column). Emphasise the systematic right-to-left approach. Practise 'zero as top digit' cases (300 – 47) which require multiple exchanges.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils frequently subtract the smaller digit from the larger regardless of its position (252 – 7: subtracting 2 from 7 gives 5, resulting in 255 instead of 245). They often forget to reduce the column they borrowed from by 1. Cases with zeros in the top number (300 – 47) are particularly challenging as they require cascading exchanges (300 = 29 tens and 10 ones = 2 hundreds, 9 tens, 10 ones).

**Key vocabulary:** column, subtraction, exchange, borrow, regroup, hundreds, tens, ones, digit, align

#### MA-Y3-C016 — Estimation and inverse operations in calculation
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Estimation before calculation gives a benchmark against which to check the answer (if 350 + 270 ≈ 600, an answer of 62 is clearly wrong). Using the inverse operation to check (doing the reverse calculation to verify) completes the checking cycle. Mastery means pupils routinely estimate before calculating and check using the inverse, and can identify when an answer is unreasonable.

**Teaching guidance:** Build estimation as a habit before every calculation: 'Round each number to the nearest hundred, add them, and write down your estimate.' After calculating, compare the exact answer to the estimate and judge reasonableness. For inverse checking: after computing 352 + 178 = 530, check by doing 530 – 178 = 352. Connect estimation to rounding, which is formalised in Year 4. Discuss why checking matters in real-world contexts (making change, measuring).

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often see estimation as a separate activity unconnected to the main calculation. They may estimate after calculating (when the estimate is biased by the answer they already have) rather than before. Some pupils do not understand that checking with the inverse should give back the original number — they just repeat the original calculation.

**Key vocabulary:** estimate, approximate, round, inverse, check, verify, reasonable, expect, predict, difference

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**MA-Y3-D002-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Place value is the positional pattern in our base-10 number system — pupils recognise how each digit's value follows a regular, predictable rule they can extend indefinitely.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Scale, Proportion and Quantity**: How big, how many, or how much — and how does that change how we think about it?
  Why: Understanding that each place is ten times the previous introduces the multiplicative structure of our number system — a fundamentally proportional idea.
  AI instruction: Use the SCALE, PROPORTION AND QUANTITY lens: prompt pupils to compare quantities using ratios and percentages, consider what changes when scale changes, and choose appropriate units of measurement. Useful questions: 'How many times bigger?', 'What fraction of the whole?', 'What changes when we zoom in/out?', 'Which units fit best here?'

**MA-Y3-D002-CL002:**
- **Scale, Proportion and Quantity** (primary): How big, how many, or how much — and how does that change how we think about it?
  Why: This cluster is fundamentally about proportional reasoning — how quantities relate multiplicatively and how ratios and fractions describe relative size.
  AI instruction: Use the SCALE, PROPORTION AND QUANTITY lens: prompt pupils to compare quantities using ratios and percentages, consider what changes when scale changes, and choose appropriate units of measurement. Useful questions: 'How many times bigger?', 'What fraction of the whole?', 'What changes when we zoom in/out?', 'Which units fit best here?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Proportional relationships follow predictable patterns (doubling one quantity doubles the other) that pupils can identify and use to solve problems.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

## Domain: MA-Y3-D003 — Number - Multiplication and Division
**Subject:** Mathematics | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-8 | **Structure:** sequential

### Curriculum Context
In Year 3, pupils build on their knowledge of the 2, 5 and 10 times tables from KS1 to learn the 3, 4 and 8 multiplication tables. The non-statutory guidance highlights that pupils should practise mental methods and should begin progressing to formal written methods, understanding that multiplication is commutative but division is not. Pupils develop fluency in the 3, 4 and 8 tables and understand the connections between them — notably that 4 is the double of 2, and 8 is the double of 4 — which supports efficient recall. The introduction of two-digit by one-digit multiplication through both mental and early formal methods prepares pupils for the long and short multiplication of Year 4 and beyond, while scaling and correspondence problems develop proportional reasoning that is foundational for ratio and proportion in Year 6.

### Concepts (7)

#### MA-Y3-C017 — 3 times table and related division facts **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 4

The 3 times table (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36) and corresponding division facts (e.g. 24 ÷ 3 = 8) are statutory Year 3 knowledge. Pupils must know all multiplication and division facts for the 3 times table to automaticity. Mastery means pupils can instantly recall any 3× fact in multiplication or division form, and apply these facts to solve problems and to derive related facts (e.g. 30 × 3 = 90).

**Teaching guidance:** Connect to skip counting in threes, which was introduced in Year 2. Use concrete equal groups (3 groups of 4, 4 groups of 3) to show commutativity. Chanting, songs, and multiplication grids are standard practice tools, but instant recall is the goal — not just procedural recitation. The digit sum pattern for multiples of 3 (the sum of the digits is always a multiple of 3: 12 → 1+2=3, 18 → 1+8=9) is a powerful self-checking tool. Connect immediately to the corresponding division facts.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may know multiplication facts but not the corresponding division facts, treating them as entirely separate items of knowledge. The commutativity of multiplication (3 × 8 = 8 × 3) is not always obvious to pupils, who may know 3 × 8 but not 8 × 3. Some pupils confuse 3 × 7 = 21 with 3 × 6 = 18 or 3 × 8 = 24, particularly in the middle of the table.

**Key vocabulary:** three times table, multiply, divide, multiplication fact, division fact, product, quotient, multiples of three, factor

#### MA-Y3-C018 — 4 times table and related division facts
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 2

The 4 times table (4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48) and corresponding division facts are statutory Year 3 knowledge. Pupils should recognise the connection to the 2 times table through doubling (4 = 2 × 2, so 4 × n = 2 × 2 × n = double the corresponding entry in the 2 times table). Mastery means instant recall of all multiplication and division facts and confident application in problem-solving.

**Teaching guidance:** Establish the doubling connection: write out the 2 times table and then double each answer to get the 4 times table. Use arrays (a 4 × 6 array can be seen as two 2 × 6 arrays) to make this visual. Practise with a mix of multiplication and division questions. Connect to the 8 times table (doubling again). The pattern that all multiples of 4 are even is worth noticing.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils who learn the 4 times table by rote without the doubling connection may have many isolated facts to memorise rather than seeing the structure. Common specific errors: 4 × 7 = 29 or 4 × 6 = 28 (off by one error). Pupils may not recognise that 32 ÷ 4 = 8 even when they know 4 × 8 = 32.

**Key vocabulary:** four times table, multiply, divide, double, product, quotient, factor, multiple, array, even number

#### MA-Y3-C019 — 8 times table and related division facts
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

The 8 times table (8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96) and corresponding division facts represent the most demanding multiplication table for Year 3. Pupils should understand the doubling connection from the 4 times table. Mastery means instant recall of all facts and confident application in calculation and problem-solving contexts.

**Teaching guidance:** Use the doubling chain: 2s → 4s → 8s. Each entry in the 8 times table is double the corresponding 4 times table entry (and four times the 2 times table entry). Use halving as the inverse strategy for division: 64 ÷ 8: halve 64 to get 32, halve again to get 16, halve again to get 8 — so 64 ÷ 8 = 8. Practise with a mix of multiplication and division. The pattern in the ones digits of multiples of 8 (8, 6, 4, 2, 0, 8, 6, 4, 2, 0...) can be a memory aid.

**Common misconceptions:** The 8 times table is the hardest in Year 3. Common errors: 8 × 7 = 54 or 56 (confusion with 7 × 8 = 56 vs 6 × 9 = 54), 8 × 6 = 48 (often confused with 8 × 7). Pupils may know 8 × n facts but not the related division facts. The doubling strategy takes practice to apply fluently.

**Key vocabulary:** eight times table, multiply, divide, double, halve, product, quotient, factor, multiple

#### MA-Y3-C020 — Connection between 2, 4 and 8 times tables (doubling)
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

The 2, 4 and 8 times tables are connected by repeated doubling: 4 = 2 × 2, so 4 × n = 2 × (2 × n); 8 = 2 × 4, so 8 × n = 2 × (4 × n). Understanding this relationship enables pupils to derive unknown facts from known ones and to make sense of the tables rather than memorising isolated facts. Mastery means pupils can explain the connection, use doubling to derive any 4× or 8× fact from the 2× table, and apply this understanding to division by halving.

**Teaching guidance:** Write the three tables side by side and highlight the doubling relationship. Use the 'doubling machine': start with the 2 times table and pass it through a doubling machine to produce the 4 times table, and through another to get the 8 times table. Connect to knowledge that 4 and 8 are powers of 2. Use halving to divide by 4 (halve twice) or by 8 (halve three times). This structural knowledge supports mathematical reasoning beyond mere recall.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils who learn all three tables separately without the connection lose a powerful memory scaffold. Some pupils understand the doubling connection in multiplication but do not apply it in reverse for division (halving). The connection between 2s, 4s and 8s is not automatically generalised to other doubling relationships (e.g. 3s and 6s).

**Key vocabulary:** double, halve, twice, connection, relationship, times table, multiple, factor, pattern

#### MA-Y3-C021 — Written multiplication methods (2-digit × 1-digit) **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 3

Multiplying a two-digit number by a one-digit number requires pupils to extend their times table knowledge and begin transitioning to formal written methods. This can be done using partitioning (24 × 3 = 20 × 3 + 4 × 3 = 60 + 12 = 72) or a grid method. Mastery means pupils can reliably compute any two-digit by one-digit multiplication using a written method and can explain why their method works using place value.

**Teaching guidance:** The grid method provides a powerful pictorial bridge: draw a rectangle labelled with the two-digit number along the top (split into tens and ones) and the one-digit number on the side; calculate the area of each part; add the partial products. This makes the distributive law visible. Progress from expanded methods to compact short multiplication as fluency develops. Always check with estimation: 24 × 3 ≈ 24 × 3 ≈ 20 × 3 = 60, so 72 is plausible.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils who do not partition correctly forget to multiply the tens part (computing 24 × 3 as 4 × 3 = 12, giving 12 rather than 72). In the grid method, pupils sometimes forget to add the partial products. In compact methods, pupils may not carry correctly: 24 × 3 = 4 × 3 = 12 (write 2, carry 1), 2 × 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, giving 72 correctly — but the carry is often forgotten.

**Key vocabulary:** multiply, partition, grid method, partial product, distributive law, two-digit, one-digit, written method, area model

#### MA-Y3-C022 — Scaling problems
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Scaling problems involve comparing quantities as multiples of each other (e.g. 'Four times as many', 'Three times as tall'). They differ from repeated addition because they express a multiplicative relationship. Mastery means pupils can interpret scaling language, write the corresponding multiplication or division statement, and solve problems involving integer scaling in real and mathematical contexts.

**Teaching guidance:** Use visual bar models to show scaling: a bar representing one unit and another bar showing 4 units alongside makes 'four times as many' concrete. Use familiar contexts: if one jar holds 3 sweets, how many does a jar four times as big hold? Introduce both 'times as many' (multiplication) and 'times as many fewer' or 'what fraction of' (division) forms. Connect to the multiplicative comparison language that will be used in ratios in Year 6.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often confuse additive and multiplicative comparison: 'four more' (additive: 7 and 3) versus 'four times as many' (multiplicative: 12 and 3). They may add 4 instead of multiplying by 4. The language 'three times shorter' is ambiguous and non-standard — pupils need to learn to interpret such phrasing critically.

**Key vocabulary:** times as many, times as much, scaling, multiply, divide, times as tall, as long as, factor, multiple

#### MA-Y3-C023 — Correspondence problems
Type: skill | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 4

Correspondence problems involve finding all possible combinations when n objects are connected to m objects (e.g. 3 hats and 4 coats: how many different outfits?). This introduces systematic enumeration and the idea that the number of combinations is the product of the number of options (3 × 4 = 12). Mastery means pupils can work systematically to find all combinations and connect this to multiplication.

**Teaching guidance:** Begin with small, concrete examples using physical objects: use real hats and coats, or drawings. Teach systematic listing: fix one hat and try it with each coat, then move to the next hat. Record results in a table. Introduce the multiplication as a shortcut: 'There are 3 × 4 = 12 combinations because for each of the 3 hats there are 4 coat choices.' Connect to the idea that this is a 3-by-4 array of possibilities.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often count combinations randomly and miss some or double-count others. They may not connect the systematic listing to multiplication and see the two as completely separate activities. When numbers get larger, non-systematic approaches quickly become unmanageable.

**Key vocabulary:** combination, possibility, systematic, multiply, choose, connect, match, table, enumerate

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**MA-Y3-D003-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: The four operations follow consistent patterns and rules (commutativity, distributivity, inverse relationships) that pupils recognise across different number types.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Each operation enacts a causal transformation: adding causes an increase, multiplying by a factor causes proportional growth — understanding this causality deepens fluency.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

**MA-Y3-D003-CL002:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Place value is the positional pattern in our base-10 number system — pupils recognise how each digit's value follows a regular, predictable rule they can extend indefinitely.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Scale, Proportion and Quantity**: How big, how many, or how much — and how does that change how we think about it?
  Why: Understanding that each place is ten times the previous introduces the multiplicative structure of our number system — a fundamentally proportional idea.
  AI instruction: Use the SCALE, PROPORTION AND QUANTITY lens: prompt pupils to compare quantities using ratios and percentages, consider what changes when scale changes, and choose appropriate units of measurement.

## Domain: MA-Y3-D004 — Number - Fractions
**Subject:** Mathematics | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-8 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Year 3 is the point at which pupils extend their understanding of fractions significantly beyond the simple halves and quarters of KS1, encountering a wider range of unit and non-unit fractions and the fundamental concept of equivalent fractions. The non-statutory guidance explains that pupils should count up and down in tenths on a number line and connect tenths to place value — understanding that one-tenth is the same as dividing by 10 — which lays essential groundwork for decimal notation in Year 4. Pupils learn to add and subtract fractions with the same denominator and to compare and order fractions, developing the understanding that fractions are numbers that can be placed on a number line. This domain provides the conceptual foundations for the substantially more complex fraction and decimal work of Years 4, 5 and 6, and its careful development is essential for future algebraic and proportional reasoning.

### Concepts (6)

#### MA-Y3-C024 — Tenths as fractions and in place value
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

A tenth arises when one whole is divided into 10 equal parts; each part is one tenth (1/10). This concept bridges fractions and decimals because one tenth (1/10) is the first decimal place (0.1). Counting in tenths connects to the number line and to measurement (e.g. 1/10 of a metre = 10 cm). Mastery means pupils understand tenths as both fractions and as parts of decimal numbers, can count in tenths on a number line, and recognise that dividing a one-digit number by 10 gives tenths.

**Teaching guidance:** Use a metre stick divided into 10 equal parts (each 10 cm = 1/10 of a metre) as a concrete tool. Fraction strips or circles divided into 10 equal sectors provide visual representations. Count in tenths on a number line from 0 to 2: 0/10, 1/10, 2/10... 10/10, 11/10... showing tenths beyond 1. Connect to division: 6 ÷ 10 = 6/10 (six tenths). Note that the formal decimal notation (0.1) is not introduced until Year 4, but the fractional concept (1/10) is established here.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may think 1/10 is a large fraction because 10 is a large number — not understanding that larger denominators mean smaller parts. They may count tenths as: one tenth, two tenths... ten tenths, eleven tenths instead of one whole and one tenth. The connection between 1/10 and 0.1 is not made until Year 4 so pupils at this stage work purely in fraction notation.

**Key vocabulary:** tenth, one tenth, divide by ten, fraction, equal parts, number line, decimal, 1/10

#### MA-Y3-C025 — Unit fractions with small denominators **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 3

Unit fractions have a numerator of 1 (e.g. 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, 1/8, 1/10). In Year 3, pupils extend their KS1 understanding of 1/2 and 1/4 to a wider range of unit fractions. They find unit fractions of discrete sets of objects and numbers, and place unit fractions on a number line. Mastery means pupils understand that the denominator tells how many equal parts the whole is divided into, the numerator tells how many parts are being counted, and can compare unit fractions (understanding that 1/3 > 1/4 > 1/5 because larger denominators mean smaller parts).

**Teaching guidance:** Use fraction walls (visual representations showing fractions of a whole, with bars divided into halves, thirds, quarters, fifths etc.) as the primary pictorial tool. Fraction circles and folded paper provide concrete experience. Emphasise the equal-parts definition — 1/3 means one of THREE EQUAL PARTS, and all three parts must be the same size. Place unit fractions on a number line between 0 and 1. Compare: '1/4 < 1/3 because splitting into 4 parts makes each part smaller than splitting into 3 parts.'

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils commonly believe larger denominators mean larger fractions (thinking 1/8 > 1/3 because 8 > 3). They may also accept non-equal partitions as valid fractions. When finding 1/3 of 9 objects, pupils may distribute them one at a time without checking the equal-parts condition.

**Key vocabulary:** unit fraction, numerator, denominator, equal parts, one third, one quarter, one fifth, one eighth, fraction wall, number line

#### MA-Y3-C026 — Non-unit fractions with small denominators
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Non-unit fractions have a numerator greater than 1 (e.g. 2/3, 3/4, 5/8). They represent multiple parts of a whole divided equally. In Year 3, pupils learn to recognise, find and use non-unit fractions, building on their secure knowledge of unit fractions. Mastery means pupils can find a non-unit fraction of a set (e.g. 3/4 of 20 = 15) by first finding the unit fraction and multiplying, and can place non-unit fractions on a number line.

**Teaching guidance:** Build from unit fractions: 'We know 1/4 of 20 = 5, so 3/4 of 20 = 3 × 5 = 15.' Use fraction bars and circles to show multiple parts coloured. Place non-unit fractions on a number line — this shows that 3/4 is closer to 1 than to 0, and that fractions get larger as the numerator increases (when denominator is fixed). Connect to the concept that a non-unit fraction is several equal parts combined.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils sometimes find the unit fraction correctly but forget to multiply by the numerator (finding 3/4 of 20 as just 5 rather than 15). Some pupils treat the numerator and denominator as independent whole numbers (saying 3/4 of 20 = 3 out of 4 of 20, then not knowing how to proceed). The connection between finding fractions of quantities and division is not always clear.

**Key vocabulary:** non-unit fraction, numerator, denominator, multiply, fraction of, parts, whole, number line

#### MA-Y3-C027 — Equivalent fractions
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Equivalent fractions are different fractions that represent the same value (e.g. 1/2 = 2/4 = 3/6 = 4/8). Pupils in Year 3 use diagrams and visual representations to recognise and show equivalent fractions with small denominators. Mastery means pupils can identify and generate equivalent fractions, understand that multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the same number produces an equivalent fraction, and use equivalence to compare and order fractions.

**Teaching guidance:** Fraction walls are the most powerful tool: line up bars showing halves, quarters and eighths to see that 1/2 = 2/4 = 4/8 visually. Fraction circles also demonstrate this well. Folding paper: fold a strip in half (showing 1/2), then fold again to show quarters (2/4), then again (4/8). Use diagrams to show the pattern: multiplying top and bottom by 2 doubles both. At Year 3, the formal rule (multiply by n/n) is introduced pictorially rather than algebraically.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils who have not developed the pictorial understanding may not believe that 1/2 = 2/4 because 'the numbers are different.' They may think that multiplying both numerator and denominator by the same number changes the value of the fraction. Some pupils confuse equivalent fractions (same value) with equal fractions (identical notation).

**Key vocabulary:** equivalent, equal, same value, fraction wall, multiply, numerator, denominator, simplify

#### MA-Y3-C028 — Adding and subtracting fractions with the same denominator
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

When fractions have the same denominator, they can be added or subtracted by operating on the numerators only, keeping the denominator constant (e.g. 3/7 + 2/7 = 5/7; 5/8 – 2/8 = 3/8). The constraint 'within one whole' means results remain between 0 and 1. Mastery means pupils can reliably add and subtract same-denominator fractions, understand why only the numerators change, and connect this to counting in fractions on a number line.

**Teaching guidance:** Use a fraction number line to show addition as movement along the line: start at 3/7, move 2/7 further to reach 5/7. Fraction bars provide a concrete/pictorial approach: shade 3 parts of a 7-part bar, then shade 2 more — 5 parts shaded in total. Emphasise: 'The denominator tells us the size of each piece; the pieces don't change when we add, we just count more of them.' Connect to whole-number addition: 3 sevenths + 2 sevenths = 5 sevenths, just as 3 apples + 2 apples = 5 apples.

**Common misconceptions:** The most common error is adding or subtracting both numerators and denominators: 3/7 + 2/7 = 5/14 (wrong). Pupils who make this error do not understand that the denominator represents the type of unit being counted, which does not change when you combine same-type units. Subtracting to get a zero numerator (3/5 – 3/5 = 0/5 = 0) also confuses some pupils.

**Key vocabulary:** add fractions, subtract fractions, same denominator, numerator, denominator, total, difference, fraction bar, number line

#### MA-Y3-C029 — Comparing and ordering fractions
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

In Year 3, pupils compare and order unit fractions (understanding that 1/2 > 1/3 > 1/4 > 1/5 because larger denominators make smaller parts) and compare fractions with the same denominator (where the larger numerator indicates the larger fraction, e.g. 5/8 > 3/8). Mastery means pupils can compare any two fractions encountered at this stage with justification, and order a set of unit fractions or same-denominator fractions correctly.

**Teaching guidance:** Use fraction walls to compare unit fractions visually — the bar divided into halves is longer per part than the bar divided into quarters. For same-denominator fractions, colour fraction bars and compare the shaded areas. Use a shared number line to place multiple fractions and compare their positions. Introduce the language 'greater than', 'less than' and 'equal to' explicitly in fraction contexts. Avoid the symbol approach until pupils have strong conceptual understanding.

**Common misconceptions:** The most persistent misconception is 'larger denominator = larger fraction' for unit fractions (thinking 1/8 > 1/3). For same-denominator fractions, pupils may compare denominators rather than numerators. Some pupils are confused by equivalent fractions appearing at different positions in an ordered list.

**Key vocabulary:** compare, order, greater than, less than, unit fraction, same denominator, fraction wall, number line, ascending, descending

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**MA-Y3-D004-CL001:**
- **Scale, Proportion and Quantity** (primary): How big, how many, or how much — and how does that change how we think about it?
  Why: This cluster is fundamentally about proportional reasoning — how quantities relate multiplicatively and how ratios and fractions describe relative size.
  AI instruction: Use the SCALE, PROPORTION AND QUANTITY lens: prompt pupils to compare quantities using ratios and percentages, consider what changes when scale changes, and choose appropriate units of measurement. Useful questions: 'How many times bigger?', 'What fraction of the whole?', 'What changes when we zoom in/out?', 'Which units fit best here?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Proportional relationships follow predictable patterns (doubling one quantity doubles the other) that pupils can identify and use to solve problems.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

## Domain: MA-Y3-D005 — Measurement
**Subject:** Mathematics | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-8 | **Structure:** mixed

### Curriculum Context
In Year 3, the measurement domain significantly extends KS1 knowledge by introducing millimetres, mixed units (e.g. 1 m and 50 cm), simple metric equivalents, and calculating the perimeter of 2-D shapes for the first time. The non-statutory guidance indicates that pupils continue to measure using a range of instruments, read scales with increasing accuracy in a range of contexts, and that they should be able to carry out additions and subtractions with measurements in the same units. Money work progresses to include formal £ and p notation and giving change, while time is extended to Roman numerals on clock faces, 12- and 24-hour clocks, and reading the time to the nearest minute. These practical measurement skills reinforce pupils' number understanding in applied contexts and connect directly to the formal calculation methods being developed in the number domains.

### Concepts (6)

#### MA-Y3-C030 — Measuring in mixed units (length, mass, volume)
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 2

In Year 3, pupils work with measurements given in mixed units — for example, 1 m 45 cm, 2 kg 300 g, 1 l 250 ml — and perform calculations with such measurements. They also recognise simple equivalents (e.g. 1 km = 1000 m, 1 m = 100 cm, 1 m = 1000 mm, 1 kg = 1000 g, 1 l = 1000 ml). Mastery means pupils can read measuring instruments accurately, record measurements in appropriate units, and carry out addition and subtraction with measurements.

**Teaching guidance:** Use real measuring instruments: rulers in mm/cm/m, kitchen scales in g/kg, measuring jugs in ml/l. The curriculum specifies mm is introduced in Year 3, so ensure this unit is covered. Simple equivalents: use the pattern that kilo- means 1000, so 1 kilogram = 1000 grams, 1 kilometre = 1000 metres. Connect to place value: 1 m 45 cm = 145 cm (multiply metres by 100 and add centimetres). Practise reading scales with non-standard intervals.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils confuse mm and cm (writing 45 mm as 45 cm). They may add mixed units without converting (1 m 70 cm + 50 cm = 1 m 120 cm rather than 2 m 20 cm). Converting between units requires the multiplication/division knowledge from the number domain, and pupils often use the wrong conversion factor (multiplying by 10 rather than 100 for cm to mm).

**Key vocabulary:** millimetre, centimetre, metre, kilometre, gram, kilogram, millilitre, litre, equivalent, convert, mixed units, measure, scale

#### MA-Y3-C031 — Perimeter of simple 2-D shapes
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Perimeter is the distance around the boundary of a flat (2-D) shape, found by adding the lengths of all its sides. In Year 3, pupils measure the perimeter of simple rectilinear shapes. Mastery means pupils understand perimeter as a length measurement (in mm, cm or m), can measure sides accurately and add them, and can distinguish perimeter from area.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce perimeter physically: pupils walk the perimeter of the playground or run a finger around the edge of a shape. Measure sides using a ruler and record each length before adding. Simple rectilinear shapes (made from squares on squared paper) allow pupils to count squares along each side before measuring. Emphasise: perimeter is the total length around the outside, not the space inside (which is area). Use the formula for a rectangle (2 × length + 2 × width) informally at this stage.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils frequently confuse perimeter (length around the outside) with area (space inside). They may count the squares of a shape (area) rather than measuring around its edge (perimeter). When measuring rectilinear shapes, pupils sometimes miss a side or count a vertex rather than a side. On shapes with equal opposite sides, pupils may only measure two sides and forget to double them.

**Key vocabulary:** perimeter, boundary, edge, distance, measure, length, add, total, centimetre, metre

#### MA-Y3-C032 — Money calculations with £ and p
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

In Year 3, pupils add and subtract amounts of money expressed in both pounds and pence (e.g. £3.45 + £1.27 = £4.72) and calculate change. This requires understanding the notation £x.pp, relating pounds and pence to the decimal place value system. Mastery means pupils can fluently perform calculations in mixed £/p notation and give change by counting up from the purchase price to the amount tendered.

**Teaching guidance:** Connect to decimal notation: £1.45 means 1 pound and 45 pence, paralleling 1 whole and 45 hundredths. Use play money in practical shopkeeper role-plays as the primary concrete context. Teach giving change as 'counting up' (complementary addition): from £1.37 to £2.00, count up 3p to £1.40, then 60p to £2.00, giving change of 63p. This strategy is more intuitive than subtraction. Connect to columnar addition/subtraction for written calculations.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils confuse £ and p notation — writing £45 to mean 45 pence, or 45p to mean £4.50. They may add pounds and pence in separate columns without converting: £1.45 + 75p is handled as 1.45 + 0.75 = 2.20 by some but as 1.45 + 75 = 76.45 by others. The conversion between pence and pounds (÷ 100) is often unreliable.

**Key vocabulary:** pounds, pence, £, p, change, total, cost, amount, decimal point, notation, add, subtract

#### MA-Y3-C033 — Time: Roman numerals I–XII and analogue clock **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 3

Roman numerals I through XII are used on traditional clock faces. Pupils must recognise these symbols and translate them to Hindu-Arabic numerals to read the time. The curriculum also requires pupils to tell and write the time from analogue clocks to the nearest minute. Mastery means pupils can read any time shown on a Roman numeral clock face and accurately report the time to the nearest minute in both words and 12-hour notation.

**Teaching guidance:** Display Roman numerals I–XII alongside their Hindu-Arabic equivalents. Focus on the additive (I, II, III, VI, VII, VIII, XI, XII) and subtractive (IV = 4, IX = 9) notations. Use real clocks with Roman numerals or large printed clock faces. Practise reading times to the nearest minute — the minute hand requires reading a scale of 60 (each minute mark is worth 1 minute), while the hour hand's position between two Roman numerals indicates the hour.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils sometimes read Roman numeral IV as 6 (confusing VI and IV). They may read the hour hand position when it is between two numbers by always rounding to the nearer number rather than the number it has passed. The minute hand scale (each interval of 5 minutes marked but individual minutes unmarked between) requires careful interpretation.

**Key vocabulary:** Roman numerals, I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, analogue clock, minute hand, hour hand, nearest minute

#### MA-Y3-C034 — 24-hour clock
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

The 24-hour clock system represents times from midnight (00:00) through midnight of the following day (23:59), avoiding the a.m./p.m. ambiguity of the 12-hour system. Afternoon hours are expressed as 13:00–23:59. Mastery means pupils can convert between 12-hour (with a.m./p.m.) and 24-hour notation and can read and write times in both systems correctly.

**Teaching guidance:** Establish: for a.m. times, the 24-hour time is the same as the 12-hour time but written with a leading zero (09:00). For p.m. times, add 12 to the 12-hour hour (3:00 p.m. = 15:00). Use a number line of 24 hours to show how p.m. continues the count past 12. Display a conversion table initially. Digital clocks showing 24-hour times provide a practical context. Connect to timetables (train, bus, television) which commonly use 24-hour notation.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils frequently forget to add 12 for p.m. times (recording 3 p.m. as 03:00 instead of 15:00). They may think 12:00 midnight is 00:00 correctly but treat 12:00 noon as 00:00 (confusing noon with midnight). The format 00:00 for midnight (rather than 24:00) can be counterintuitive.

**Key vocabulary:** 24-hour clock, 12-hour clock, a.m., p.m., midnight, noon, digital, notation, convert

#### MA-Y3-C035 — Comparing durations of time
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Comparing durations involves calculating how much time has passed between two events or which of two events took longer. This requires converting between seconds, minutes and hours as necessary. Mastery means pupils can calculate time durations using a number line or counting-on strategy, compare durations expressed in different units, and solve problems involving start and end times.

**Teaching guidance:** Use a number line timeline as the primary tool: mark the start time, mark the end time, and find the gap. For durations crossing the hour: e.g. from 2:45 to 3:20, count on 15 minutes to 3:00 then 20 more minutes = 35 minutes. Connect to subtraction in the time domain. Use real-life contexts: cooking times, journey times, the length of school lessons. The curriculum requires knowledge that there are 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day — these conversion facts are essential for duration calculations.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often treat time as a base-10 system: subtracting 2:45 from 3:20 as 3.20 – 2.45 = 0.75, giving 75 minutes rather than 35 minutes. This is the single most common error in time calculations and arises from treating time notation as a decimal. Pupils also frequently confuse 1 hour 30 minutes with 1.3 hours or 130 minutes.

**Key vocabulary:** duration, how long, time, seconds, minutes, hours, start, end, interval, calculate, number line, difference

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**MA-Y3-D005-CL001:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Geometry connects structural properties (angles, side lengths, symmetry) to what is possible or provable — the question is always how the structure determines the behaviour.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Scale, Proportion and Quantity**: How big, how many, or how much — and how does that change how we think about it?
  Why: Similarity, enlargement and trigonometry are fundamentally about proportional relationships between measurements in figures across different scales.
  AI instruction: Use the SCALE, PROPORTION AND QUANTITY lens: prompt pupils to compare quantities using ratios and percentages, consider what changes when scale changes, and choose appropriate units of measurement. Useful questions: 'How many times bigger?', 'What fraction of the whole?', 'What changes when we zoom in/out?', 'Which units fit best here?'

**MA-Y3-D005-CL002:**
- **Scale, Proportion and Quantity** (primary): How big, how many, or how much — and how does that change how we think about it?
  Why: This cluster is fundamentally about proportional reasoning — how quantities relate multiplicatively and how ratios and fractions describe relative size.
  AI instruction: Use the SCALE, PROPORTION AND QUANTITY lens: prompt pupils to compare quantities using ratios and percentages, consider what changes when scale changes, and choose appropriate units of measurement. Useful questions: 'How many times bigger?', 'What fraction of the whole?', 'What changes when we zoom in/out?', 'Which units fit best here?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Proportional relationships follow predictable patterns (doubling one quantity doubles the other) that pupils can identify and use to solve problems.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

## Domain: MA-Y3-D006 — Geometry - Properties of Shapes
**Subject:** Mathematics | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-8 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
In Year 3, geometry moves beyond recognition of shapes to drawing, constructing and analysing them. Pupils learn to draw 2-D shapes with given dimensions and to make 3-D shapes using modelling materials, developing spatial reasoning and fine motor skills. A major new development is the formal introduction of angles: pupils learn that an angle is both a property of a shape (the corner of a rectangle is a right angle) and a description of a turn (a quarter turn makes a right angle). The statutory requirements that pupils identify whether angles are greater or less than a right angle (obtuse and acute) and recognise horizontal, vertical, perpendicular and parallel lines add important geometric vocabulary and conceptual understanding that supports area calculations in Year 4, angles in Year 5 and the complete analysis of shapes throughout upper KS2.

### Concepts (4)

#### MA-Y3-C036 — Drawing 2-D shapes and making 3-D shapes
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

In Year 3, pupils move beyond recognising and naming shapes to constructing them. Drawing 2-D shapes from given specifications (e.g. draw a rectangle with sides 4 cm and 2 cm) develops precision and understanding of properties. Making 3-D shapes from modelling materials (straws and clay, commercial kits) builds understanding of the relationship between edges, faces and vertices. Mastery means pupils can accurately draw specified 2-D shapes and construct recognisable 3-D shapes from given criteria.

**Teaching guidance:** Provide rulers, set-squares and protractors for drawing. Start with shapes on squared/dotted paper for support before moving to plain paper. Teach measuring sides and marking angles before connecting them. For 3-D construction, use construction kits (e.g. Geomag, Polydron) that make edges and faces explicit. Ask pupils to count edges, faces and vertices as they build, connecting to properties. Connect to the properties explored in Years 1 and 2.

**Common misconceptions:** When drawing rectangles, pupils often draw by eye rather than measuring carefully. They may draw right angles without using a set-square. In 3-D construction, pupils sometimes build structures that look right but do not have the correct number of faces/edges/vertices. They may confuse 2-D faces with 3-D solids (calling a face 'the shape' rather than 'the face of the shape').

**Key vocabulary:** draw, construct, make, 2-D shape, 3-D shape, side, edge, face, vertex, vertices, corner, right angle, ruler, set-square, specification

#### MA-Y3-C037 — Angles as properties of shapes and as turns
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

An angle is the amount of turn between two lines that meet at a point, or equivalently the space between two lines meeting at a point (measured later in degrees). In Year 3, pupils understand angles both as properties of shapes (the corner of a square is a right angle) and as turns (rotating a quarter turn makes a right angle). Mastery means pupils can identify angles in shapes, recognise that an angle is a measure of turn, and connect the fraction of a turn to the angle size.

**Teaching guidance:** Use physical turning: pupils hold an arrow pointing forward and turn it by different amounts. Connect quarter turn = right angle, half turn = two right angles (a straight line), three-quarter turn = three right angles, full turn = four right angles. Use a set-square or corner of a piece of paper to test right angles in shapes and the environment. Identify right angles in the classroom (corners of tables, doors, windows). The word 'angle' comes from the Latin for 'corner' — use this etymology to make the concept memorable.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may think that the size of an angle is determined by the length of its arms rather than by the amount of turn between them (so a large right angle with long arms appears bigger than a small right angle with short arms). They may think an angle must have one horizontal arm. Some pupils confuse right angle (90°) with straight angle (180°).

**Key vocabulary:** angle, turn, right angle, quarter turn, half turn, three-quarter turn, full turn, acute, obtuse, degrees (not yet formal), corner, set-square

#### MA-Y3-C038 — Identifying right angles and comparing to other angles
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 2

A right angle is exactly one quarter of a full turn (later defined as 90°). Pupils must recognise right angles in shapes, as turns, and in the environment, and must compare other angles to right angles: acute angles are less than a right angle; obtuse angles are greater than a right angle (but less than a straight line). Mastery means pupils can identify right angles using a set-square, compare any angle to a right angle and classify it as right, acute or obtuse, and recognise that two right angles make a half-turn etc.

**Teaching guidance:** A folded piece of paper provides a ready-made right angle tester. Teach pupils to place it in corners of shapes and the environment to identify right angles. Then identify angles in shapes that are not right angles and classify them as 'bigger than a right angle' (obtuse) or 'smaller than a right angle' (acute). Use the memory aid: Acute = A cute small angle (both have an 'a'); Obtuse = an O-big angle. Count right angles in regular polygons: a square has 4, a rectangle has 4, a right-angled triangle has 1.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often think right angles must be 'corner shaped' with one horizontal and one vertical arm. They may not recognise a right angle tilted at 45° as still being a right angle. Pupils frequently confuse acute and obtuse, despite using mnemonics. They may also think that a straight angle (180°) is not an angle at all, since there is no visible 'corner'.

**Key vocabulary:** right angle, acute angle, obtuse angle, greater than, less than, set-square, corner, quarter turn, classify, compare

#### MA-Y3-C039 — Horizontal, vertical, perpendicular and parallel lines
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Horizontal lines are parallel to the horizon (flat). Vertical lines are perpendicular to the horizon (upright). Perpendicular lines meet at right angles. Parallel lines are always the same distance apart and never meet. These four concepts introduce precise geometric vocabulary for describing the orientation and relationship between lines. Mastery means pupils can identify and label examples of each type in shapes, diagrams and the environment.

**Teaching guidance:** Use the classroom environment to find examples: windowsills are horizontal, door frames are vertical, table legs are perpendicular to the floor, railway tracks are parallel. Use a set-square to verify perpendicularity (right angle between two lines). Parallel lines can be tested by measuring the distance between them at two points — if the same, they are parallel. Connect to shapes: a square has two pairs of parallel sides and four right angles (four pairs of perpendicular sides). Introduce correct notation: arrows on lines to show parallel; right angle squares to show perpendicular.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils frequently confuse parallel and perpendicular. Some think parallel lines must be horizontal. Pupils may think that any two lines that do not cross in their visible length are parallel, not understanding that parallel lines must never cross even when extended. Vertical and horizontal are often confused when shapes are rotated.

**Key vocabulary:** horizontal, vertical, perpendicular, parallel, right angle, pair, line, relationship, environment, notation

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**MA-Y3-D006-CL001:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Geometry connects structural properties (angles, side lengths, symmetry) to what is possible or provable — the question is always how the structure determines the behaviour.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Scale, Proportion and Quantity**: How big, how many, or how much — and how does that change how we think about it?
  Why: Similarity, enlargement and trigonometry are fundamentally about proportional relationships between measurements in figures across different scales.
  AI instruction: Use the SCALE, PROPORTION AND QUANTITY lens: prompt pupils to compare quantities using ratios and percentages, consider what changes when scale changes, and choose appropriate units of measurement. Useful questions: 'How many times bigger?', 'What fraction of the whole?', 'What changes when we zoom in/out?', 'Which units fit best here?'

## Domain: MA-Y3-D007 — Statistics
**Subject:** Mathematics | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-8 | **Structure:** sequential

### Curriculum Context
In Year 3, the statistics curriculum builds on the KS1 work of recording, interpreting and comparing simple data by requiring pupils to interpret and present data using scaled bar charts and pictograms, where each unit represents more than one item. The non-statutory guidance clarifies that pupils should ask and answer questions, including two-step questions, using information presented in bar charts, pictograms and tables. Solving questions such as 'How many more?' and 'How many fewer?' requires pupils to perform subtraction calculations on data values, connecting statistics directly to the calculation domains. This increasingly sophisticated engagement with data prepares pupils for the more complex graphical work with line graphs and pie charts encountered in Years 4 and 5.

### Concepts (2)

#### MA-Y3-C040 — Scaled bar charts and pictograms
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 2

In Year 3, bar charts and pictograms use scales where one bar unit or one symbol represents more than one item (e.g. each symbol = 5, each 1 cm on a bar chart = 10 children). Pupils must read the scale key, multiply appropriately to find values, and use these values to answer questions. Mastery means pupils can read scales on bar charts (including values between marked intervals) and pictograms (including half-symbols when one symbol represents 2 or more), and can present data in these formats.

**Teaching guidance:** Start with scales of 2 or 5 before moving to 10 or 100. For pictograms, use concrete half-symbols (a picture cut in half) before the abstract representation. Always read the key first. Practise reading values that fall between marked scale intervals. Creating their own bar charts and pictograms from given data is as important as reading them — the act of choosing a suitable scale builds understanding. Use real data from classroom surveys to make the work meaningful.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils read the numerical label on the scale as the value (reading 2 on a scale of 5 as '2 items' rather than '10 items'). Half-symbols in pictograms are often misread as zero rather than half the represented value. Pupils may not realise they need to consult the key before reading the chart, treating each bar unit as worth 1.

**Key vocabulary:** bar chart, pictogram, scale, key, frequency, interpret, present, data, axis, label, symbol, represents

#### MA-Y3-C041 — Solving one-step and two-step questions from data
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Data questions range from one-step (reading a single value directly from a chart) to two-step (reading values from a chart and then performing a calculation, e.g. finding how many more). In Year 3, pupils are explicitly required to solve two-step questions such as 'How many more children chose football than swimming?'. Mastery means pupils can identify which operation to use after reading the relevant values from a chart or table, and can answer both one-step and two-step questions accurately.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach pupils to first identify what they need to find, then identify which data values they need, then perform the calculation. Model think-alouds: 'I need to find how many more — that's a subtraction. I need to read the value for football (40) and the value for swimming (25). 40 – 25 = 15, so 15 more children chose football.' Use a range of question types: how many altogether (addition), how many more/fewer (subtraction), how many times as many (multiplication). Connect explicitly to the calculation domains.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often read values correctly but then choose the wrong operation: for 'how many more', they may add rather than subtract. For two-step questions, pupils may answer only the first step and stop. When totalling all categories, pupils may read an axis value rather than add up all the bars.

**Key vocabulary:** data, bar chart, pictogram, table, one-step, two-step, more than, fewer than, altogether, total, difference, question, interpret

  Why: Statistical work requires pupils to identify patterns and trends in data — regularities in distributions, central tendency, and relationships between variables.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Evidence and Argument**: What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Interpreting data requires constructing evidence-based arguments: pupils must decide what conclusions the data can and cannot support.

## Domain: SC-KS2-D001 — Working Scientifically
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** mixed

### Curriculum Context
Working scientifically at KS2 underpins all science learning and requires pupils to use a range of scientific methods and processes, progressing from the exploratory approaches of KS1 to systematic, fair-test investigations. Pupils develop the ability to plan different types of scientific enquiry — including observing over time, pattern seeking, classifying, comparative and fair testing, and researching using secondary sources — selecting the most appropriate method for the question being asked. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to recognise that scientific evidence is used to support or refute ideas, to take measurements using standard units, to record and present data in a variety of graphical forms, and to draw conclusions consistent with their evidence. By the end of KS2, pupils should be able to report and present findings from enquiries using appropriate scientific language and representations.

### Concepts (10)

#### SC-KS2-C001 — Relevant Questioning and Enquiry Selection
Type: process | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

The ability to ask relevant scientific questions and select the most appropriate type of scientific enquiry to answer them (observation over time, pattern seeking, classifying, fair testing, secondary research). Develops from KS1 simple questioning to active enquiry design.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce the five types of scientific enquiry explicitly: observation over time, pattern seeking, classifying and grouping, comparative and fair testing, and researching using secondary sources. Present pupils with a question and ask them to decide which type of enquiry would best answer it. Use a 'question sorter' display where pupils categorise questions by enquiry type. Model asking relevant questions by connecting to the content being studied — for example, during a rocks topic ask 'Which rock is the most permeable?' (fair test) versus 'How are fossils formed?' (secondary research).

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often believe that all scientific questions must be answered by carrying out an experiment. They need explicit teaching that observation over time, classification, pattern seeking and secondary research are equally valid enquiry types. Some pupils confuse 'relevant' questions with 'interesting' questions — relevant questions are those that can be investigated scientifically.

**Key vocabulary:** enquiry, investigate, fair test, comparative test, observation over time, pattern seeking, classify, secondary source, relevant, variable, method, question

#### SC-KS2-C002 — Fair and Comparative Testing
Type: process | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Setting up simple practical enquiries as fair tests, recognising and controlling variables. Understanding that a fair test changes only one variable at a time while keeping others constant, enabling valid comparisons.

**Teaching guidance:** Begin with comparative tests (e.g., 'Which surface does the car travel furthest on?') before introducing fair tests with controlled variables. Use a planning framework that explicitly asks: 'What will I change? What will I measure? What will I keep the same?' Provide practical contexts such as testing which paper towel is most absorbent or which material is best for insulating a cup of warm water. Encourage pupils to predict outcomes before testing and to explain why the test must be fair to get reliable results.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils frequently change more than one variable at a time without recognising this invalidates the comparison. Some pupils believe that a test is 'fair' simply because everyone in the group gets a turn, rather than understanding it as controlling variables. Pupils may also confuse prediction with guessing — a prediction should be based on existing knowledge or prior observations.

**Key vocabulary:** fair test, comparative test, variable, change, measure, keep the same, control, predict, result, reliable, method, equipment

#### SC-KS2-C003 — Systematic Measurement with Standard Units
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Making systematic and careful observations using standard units (e.g., degrees Celsius, metres, grams). Using a range of equipment including thermometers and data loggers. Increasing accuracy over Lower KS2.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach pupils to select appropriate equipment for the measurement being taken — rulers for length, thermometers for temperature, measuring cylinders for liquid volume, balances for mass. Practise reading scales with different intervals (ones, twos, fives, tens). Introduce data loggers for temperature and light investigations, demonstrating how they capture readings automatically over time. Link measurement to maths by reinforcing standard units (cm, m, g, kg, ml, l, °C) and by practising estimation before measuring.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils commonly misread scales by counting lines rather than intervals, leading to systematic errors. Some pupils believe that digital instruments are always more accurate than analogue ones. Children may not understand that reading a thermometer requires waiting for the liquid to stop moving before recording the value.

**Key vocabulary:** measure, standard unit, centimetre, metre, gram, kilogram, millilitre, litre, degrees Celsius, thermometer, data logger, accurate, systematic, scale, interval, reading

#### SC-KS2-C004 — Data Classification and Presentation
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Gathering, recording, classifying and presenting data in a variety of ways: simple scientific language, labelled diagrams, classification keys, bar charts, and tables. Moving from recording towards analytical presentation.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach each data presentation format explicitly: tables with headings and units, bar charts with labelled axes, and classification keys. Use sorting and grouping activities with real specimens (leaves, rocks, minibeasts) before introducing branching databases or keys. Model how to construct a bar chart step by step — choosing a scale, labelling axes, drawing bars accurately. Encourage pupils to select the most appropriate format for their data type (categories → bar chart, yes/no questions → classification key).

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often confuse bar charts with pictograms or line graphs and may draw bars that do not start from the baseline. Some pupils think a table is simply writing numbers in any arrangement — they need to understand that tables have clear headings, units and consistent formatting. Children may also believe that more elaborate presentation (colour, decoration) makes data 'better'.

**Key vocabulary:** table, bar chart, axis, label, scale, tally, key, classification key, data, record, present, category, diagram, heading, unit

#### SC-KS2-C005 — Drawing Conclusions and Predictions
Type: process | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Using results to draw simple conclusions, make predictions for new values, suggest improvements and raise further questions. Iterative development of scientific understanding through evidence-based reasoning.

**Teaching guidance:** Scaffold conclusion-writing with sentence starters: 'Our results show that...', 'This happened because...', 'If we changed X, I predict that...' Teach the difference between describing results (what happened) and explaining them (why it happened). Introduce prediction for new values by asking pupils to extend patterns — for example, 'If we tested a fourth surface, what do you think would happen based on our results?' Encourage pupils to identify when results are unexpected and to suggest reasons or further tests.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often restate their prediction as their conclusion regardless of what the data actually shows. They may confuse correlation with causation — for example, concluding that one thing caused another simply because they occurred together. Some pupils think that if their prediction was wrong, the investigation has 'failed', rather than understanding that disconfirming evidence is equally valuable in science.

**Key vocabulary:** conclusion, result, evidence, prediction, pattern, explain, because, support, suggest, further question, improve, unexpected, reason

#### SC-KS2-C006 — Scientific Reporting and Communication
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Reporting on findings from enquiries through oral and written explanations, displays and presentations. Using scientific language and illustrations to communicate findings to different audiences.

**Teaching guidance:** Provide opportunities for both oral and written reporting. Use 'science conferences' where groups present findings to the class, encouraging questions from the audience. Teach the structure of a scientific report: question, method, results, conclusion. Model the use of scientific vocabulary in explanations and provide word banks. Encourage pupils to use labelled diagrams and data displays as part of their communication, not just written prose.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often think that writing more equals better science communication. They need to understand that clarity and precision matter more than length. Some pupils believe that scientific reports should only contain text, not realising that diagrams, tables and charts are essential components of scientific communication.

**Key vocabulary:** report, findings, present, explain, scientific language, diagram, display, audience, evidence, method, results, conclusion, communicate

#### SC-KS2-C007 — Variable Control in Enquiry Planning
Type: process | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 4

Planning scientific enquiries by recognising and controlling variables where necessary. Understanding which variables to keep constant, which to change, and which to measure. Required for valid experimental design.

**Teaching guidance:** Use a structured planning template that requires pupils to explicitly name the independent variable (what I will change), the dependent variable (what I will measure), and the control variables (what I will keep the same). Provide practice in identifying variables across different contexts before asking pupils to plan independently. Use 'spot the error' activities where pupils critique a flawed investigation plan and identify uncontrolled variables. Connect variable control to the concept of reliability — explaining why uncontrolled variables make results untrustworthy.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often confuse the independent and dependent variables, or believe that 'keeping things the same' refers to getting the same results rather than controlling conditions. Some pupils think that controlling variables means nothing should change at all, not understanding that the independent variable must be deliberately changed. Upper KS2 pupils may struggle to identify hidden variables that they have not considered.

**Key vocabulary:** independent variable, dependent variable, control variable, plan, enquiry, method, reliable, valid, change, measure, keep the same, systematic, accuracy, precision

#### SC-KS2-C008 — Precision and Repeat Measurements
Type: skill | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 4

Taking measurements with increasing accuracy and precision using a range of scientific equipment. Understanding the value of repeat readings to improve reliability and identify anomalies.

**Teaching guidance:** Demonstrate the importance of repeat measurements by having different groups measure the same thing and comparing their results. Discuss why readings differ and how taking multiple measurements and calculating a mean improves reliability. Teach pupils to identify and discard anomalous results before calculating averages. Use contexts where precision matters — such as measuring the time for a pendulum swing or the distance a ball rolls — to motivate the need for careful, repeated measurement.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often confuse accuracy (closeness to the true value) with precision (consistency of repeat readings). Some pupils believe that taking more decimal places automatically makes a measurement more precise. Children may think that if their result differs from a classmate's, one of them must be 'wrong', rather than understanding natural variation in measurement.

**Key vocabulary:** precision, accuracy, repeat, reliable, anomaly, mean, average, measurement, reading, consistent, error, equipment, range, unit

#### SC-KS2-C009 — Complex Data Recording
Type: skill | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 4

Recording data and results of increasing complexity using scatter graphs, line graphs, bar charts, classification keys, tables and scientific diagrams. Selecting the most appropriate representation for different types of data.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce scatter graphs and line graphs as tools for continuous data, distinguishing them from bar charts used for categorical data. Teach pupils to plot points accurately and, where appropriate, draw lines of best fit. Provide opportunities to select the most suitable graph type for different investigations. Use ICT tools (spreadsheets, graphing software) alongside hand-drawn graphs. Model how to read information from graphs, including interpolating between data points and identifying trends.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often join scatter graph points dot-to-dot rather than drawing a line of best fit. They may confuse line graphs (for continuous data) with bar charts (for categorical data), using the wrong type for their data. Some pupils believe that a graph must always go through the origin (0,0), not understanding that this depends on the data.

**Key vocabulary:** scatter graph, line graph, bar chart, axis, scale, plot, data point, trend, line of best fit, classification key, table, continuous, categorical, interpret

#### SC-KS2-C010 — Causal Relationships and Evidence Evaluation
Type: process | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 4

Identifying causal relationships in data. Evaluating degree of trust in results. Identifying scientific evidence that supports or refutes ideas and arguments. Distinguishing opinion from fact in secondary sources.

**Teaching guidance:** Use investigations with clear causal links (e.g., increasing temperature speeds up dissolving) to model the difference between correlation and causation. Teach pupils to evaluate the trustworthiness of results by considering sample size, whether variables were controlled, and whether results are repeatable. Introduce the idea that scientific claims require evidence by examining real examples of scientific debate. Use newspaper or media science claims as stimuli for critical evaluation, asking 'What is the evidence? Is it strong enough?'

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils commonly assume that correlation implies causation — for example, that because ice cream sales and sunburn both increase in summer, ice cream causes sunburn. They may also believe that a single investigation provides definitive proof, rather than understanding that scientific conclusions become stronger with repeated, independent evidence. Some pupils struggle to distinguish between scientific evidence and personal opinion.

**Key vocabulary:** cause, effect, causal, correlation, evidence, evaluate, trust, reliable, secondary source, opinion, fact, argument, support, refute, scientific claim

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS2-D001-CL001:**
- **Cause and Effect** (primary): What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Fair testing and investigations are designed to isolate variables and establish causal relationships — the cognitive demand is reasoning from controlled evidence to causal claims.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Data from repeated investigations reveals patterns that allow pupils to generalise their findings beyond the specific test conditions.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

## Domain: SC-KS2-D002 — Plants
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
The Plants domain at KS2 builds on the introductory plant knowledge from KS1 to develop a scientific understanding of the life processes, nutrition and reproduction of plants. Pupils investigate how plants grow and are structured, learning about the functions of the root, stem, leaf and flower in the plant's life cycle. The statutory content requires pupils to explore what plants need for life and growth, to understand photosynthesis as the process by which plants make food from sunlight, water and carbon dioxide, and to understand the process of seed dispersal and pollination. Pupils investigate and observe the growing of plants from seeds and bulbs, developing their ability to conduct systematic observations over time and record changes.

### Concepts (6)

#### SC-KS2-C011 — Plant Part Functions
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that different parts of flowering plants have specific functions: roots (anchorage and water/nutrient uptake), stems/trunks (support and water transport), leaves (photosynthesis and gas exchange), flowers (reproduction). Structure-function relationship.

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate root function by growing plants in transparent containers so pupils observe root growth. Demonstrate water transport by placing white carnations or celery in coloured water and observing colour change in petals or leaves over 24 hours. Use leaf rubbings and close observation with hand lenses to explore leaf structure. Dissect flowers to connect flower parts to their reproductive function. Create annotated diagrams linking each plant part to its role: roots absorb water and anchor; stems transport water and support; leaves make food using light; flowers enable reproduction.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often think that roots only absorb water, not realising they also anchor the plant and absorb dissolved minerals. Many children believe that plants get their food from the soil rather than making it in their leaves through photosynthesis. Some pupils think all flowers are decorative and do not understand their essential reproductive function.

**Key vocabulary:** root, stem, leaf, flower, absorb, anchor, transport, support, photosynthesis, nutrition, reproduction, petal, stamen, carpel, pollen, function

#### SC-KS2-C012 — Plant Requirements for Life and Growth
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that plants need air, light, water, nutrients from soil, and room to grow. These requirements vary between plant species. Plants can make their own food (photosynthesis concept introduced without detailed mechanism).

**Teaching guidance:** Set up controlled investigations where plants are deprived of one requirement at a time — one group with no light, one with no water, one in a cold environment — while a control plant receives all requirements. Record observations over two to three weeks using a consistent observation schedule. Introduce the concept that plants make their own food using light (photosynthesis) without requiring the detailed mechanism. Compare plant nutrition with animal nutrition — plants make food, animals must eat. Discuss why different plants may need different amounts of light or water.

**Common misconceptions:** The most persistent misconception is that plants get their food from the soil. Plants make their own food through photosynthesis — they absorb water and minerals from the soil but these are raw materials, not food. Some children think plants only need sunlight and water, forgetting that air (carbon dioxide) is also essential. Children may believe that fertiliser is plant food rather than a mineral supplement.

**Key vocabulary:** light, water, air, nutrients, soil, temperature, photosynthesis, food, grow, healthy, survive, requirements, conditions, minerals, carbon dioxide

#### SC-KS2-C013 — Water Transport in Plants
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding that water is transported upward within plants through the stem to leaves and flowers. Observable through the coloured carnation investigation. Links root function to water availability and stem function to transport.

**Teaching guidance:** Conduct the classic coloured water investigation: place white carnations or celery sticks in water with food colouring and observe the results after several hours. Cut celery stalks crosswise to reveal the coloured transport vessels. Use magnifying glasses to examine the tiny tubes visible in cut stems. Connect this observation to the function of roots (absorbing water) and stems (transporting it upward). Discuss why plants wilt when they lack water — the transport system has nothing to carry.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often think water travels through the centre of the stem rather than through specialised tubes (xylem vessels) near the outside. Some children believe the plant 'sucks' water up like a straw, rather than understanding that water is drawn up by evaporation from the leaves (transpiration pull). Children may not connect wilting to water transport failure.

**Key vocabulary:** transport, water, stem, root, absorb, vessel, tube, upward, wilt, leaf, flower, nutrients, dissolved, minerals

#### SC-KS2-C014 — Flowering Plant Life Cycle **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 4 | Fan-out: 3

Understanding the complete life cycle of flowering plants: germination, growth, pollination, seed formation, seed dispersal, and back to germination. Understanding the role of flowers in reproduction and the variety of seed dispersal mechanisms.

**Teaching guidance:** Create a life cycle diagram as a circular flow chart, emphasising that it is a continuous cycle. Grow fast-cycling plants such as rapid-cycling brassicas (Wisconsin Fast Plants) that complete their life cycle in 35-40 days, allowing pupils to observe every stage. Dissect mature flowers to observe pollen and ovules. Collect seed heads and fruits to examine dispersal structures. Use time-lapse videos to show stages that are too slow to observe in real time. Compare the flowering plant life cycle with animal life cycles studied later.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think of a life cycle as linear (seed → plant → death) rather than circular. Some pupils believe all plants grow from seeds, not recognising that bulbs, tubers and runners are also starting points. Children may confuse pollination (transfer of pollen) with fertilisation (fusion of male and female cells) or use the terms interchangeably.

**Key vocabulary:** life cycle, germination, growth, pollination, fertilisation, seed formation, seed dispersal, flower, fruit, pollen, ovule, reproduce, mature, cycle

#### SC-KS2-C015 — Pollination
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding that pollination is the transfer of pollen between flowers, enabling seed formation. Part of the flowering plant reproductive cycle. Includes wind and insect pollination.

**Teaching guidance:** Examine flowers with hand lenses to identify the pollen-producing stamens and the pollen-receiving stigma. Compare insect-pollinated flowers (bright petals, scent, nectar, sticky pollen) with wind-pollinated flowers (small petals or none, large amounts of light pollen, feathery stigmas). Observe bees visiting flowers in the school garden if possible, discussing how pollen is transferred on their bodies. Use role-play or models to demonstrate pollen transfer between flowers. Link pollination to fruit and seed formation as the next stage in the plant life cycle.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often confuse pollination with seed dispersal or think pollination is the same as fertilisation. Some pupils believe bees deliberately collect pollen to help plants, rather than understanding that pollination is an incidental consequence of bees feeding on nectar. Children may think that all flowers are insect-pollinated, not recognising wind pollination in grasses and many trees.

**Key vocabulary:** pollination, pollen, stamen, stigma, anther, insect pollination, wind pollination, nectar, transfer, flower, bee, reproduce, fertilisation

#### SC-KS2-C016 — Seed Dispersal
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding that seeds are dispersed from parent plants by various mechanisms including wind, water, animals (internally and externally) and explosive mechanisms. Structure of fruits relates to dispersal method.

**Teaching guidance:** Collect a variety of seeds and fruits and challenge pupils to identify their dispersal mechanism by examining their structures. Examples: dandelion (wind — parachute), sycamore (wind — helicopter), burdock (animal — hooks), cherry (animal — eaten), coconut (water — floats), pea pod (explosive — springs open). Design and make seed dispersal models (paper helicopters, parachutes) and test which designs travel furthest. Discuss why dispersal away from the parent plant is advantageous — reduced competition for light, water and space.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think fruits are only the sweet edible items found in supermarkets. In biology, a fruit is any structure that contains seeds — including sycamore wings, conkers and pea pods. Some pupils believe seeds need to land on soil to grow, rather than understanding that seeds can germinate in many substrates if conditions are right. Children may not understand why dispersal is beneficial, thinking it would be better for seeds to stay near the parent plant.

**Key vocabulary:** seed dispersal, wind, water, animal, explosive, parachute, hook, fruit, scatter, spread, structure, mechanism, advantage, competition, germination

**SC-KS2-D002-CL001:**
- **Cause and Effect** (primary): What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Fair testing and investigations are designed to isolate variables and establish causal relationships — the cognitive demand is reasoning from controlled evidence to causal claims.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Data from repeated investigations reveals patterns that allow pupils to generalise their findings beyond the specific test conditions.

Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**SC-KS2-D002-CL002:**
- **Evidence and Argument** (primary): What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: This cluster asks pupils to gather, record or communicate scientific findings — the core cognitive demand is evaluating what counts as valid evidence and how to present it clearly.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Scientific observations and enquiry serve to establish causal relationships; framing questions around 'what causes X' gives purpose to the observation work.

Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Data from repeated investigations reveals patterns that allow pupils to generalise their findings beyond the specific test conditions.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

## Domain: SC-KS2-D003 — Animals, Including Humans
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Animals Including Humans at KS2 extends pupils' understanding from the basic needs and life processes studied at KS1 to a more detailed understanding of animal biology, nutrition, circulation and reproduction. Pupils learn about the digestive system and the role of nutrition in health, the structure and function of the skeletal and muscular systems, and the circulatory system including the heart and blood. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to investigate the effects of diet, exercise and lifestyle on health and wellbeing, and to understand how offspring inherit characteristics from parents through reproduction. By upper KS2, pupils understand the changes that occur as humans develop from birth to old age, providing a foundation for the more detailed human biology studied at KS3.

### Concepts (9)

#### SC-KS2-C017 — Animal Nutrition
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding that animals, including humans, require the right types and amounts of nutrition and cannot make their own food — they obtain nutrition from what they eat. Contrasts with plants which can make their own food.

**Teaching guidance:** Explore the concept that animals, unlike plants, cannot make their own food and must eat other organisms. Classify foods into food groups (carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, fibre, water) and discuss the role of each in the body. Compare the diets of different animals and relate diet to body structure and habitat. Use food packaging labels to identify nutrients. Emphasise the contrast with plants — animals are consumers, plants are producers. Link to the concept of a balanced diet and why variety matters for health.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often think 'nutrition' means only eating healthy food, rather than understanding it as the process of obtaining the substances needed for growth and energy. Some children believe that fat and carbohydrates are always 'bad' rather than essential in appropriate amounts. Children may not understand the fundamental difference between plant and animal nutrition — that plants make their food while animals must consume it.

**Key vocabulary:** nutrition, nutrient, carbohydrate, protein, fat, vitamin, mineral, fibre, balanced diet, food group, energy, consumer, producer, diet, health

#### SC-KS2-C018 — Skeletal and Muscular Systems
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that humans and some other animals have skeletons for support, protection and movement. Muscles are attached to bones and enable movement by contracting and relaxing. Different body parts have different skeletal structures suited to their functions.

**Teaching guidance:** Use life-sized skeleton models or posters to identify major bones: skull, ribs, spine, pelvis, femur, humerus. Ask pupils to feel their own bones through their skin to connect the model to their bodies. Demonstrate how joints allow movement by comparing hinge joints (elbow, knee) with ball-and-socket joints (shoulder, hip). Use elastic bands attached to cardboard tubes to model how muscles pull on bones — showing that muscles can only pull (contract), not push. Investigate which animals have endoskeletons, exoskeletons, or no skeleton, and discuss the advantages of each.

**Common misconceptions:** Children commonly think muscles both push and pull — in reality, muscles can only contract (pull) and work in antagonistic pairs to produce movement in both directions. Some pupils believe the skeleton is a dead, rigid structure rather than living tissue that grows and repairs. Children may not realise that some animals (insects, crabs) have their skeleton on the outside (exoskeleton) and that some animals (worms, jellyfish) have no skeleton at all.

**Key vocabulary:** skeleton, bone, muscle, joint, skull, ribs, spine, pelvis, femur, support, protect, movement, contract, relax, endoskeleton, exoskeleton, hinge, ball-and-socket

#### SC-KS2-C031 — Digestive System
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding the functions of the basic parts of the human digestive system: mouth (chewing, saliva), oesophagus (transport), stomach (churning, digestion), small intestine (nutrient absorption), large intestine (water absorption). Food is broken down to release nutrients.

**Teaching guidance:** Use a large-scale diagram or model of the digestive system for pupils to trace the journey of food from mouth to large intestine. Create a physical simulation using a plastic bag (stomach) with bread and orange juice to show churning and chemical breakdown. Use tights filled with mashed banana to demonstrate the squeezing action of the oesophagus (peristalsis). Label the key organs and their functions: mouth (chewing and saliva), oesophagus (muscular tube), stomach (acid and churning), small intestine (nutrient absorption), large intestine (water absorption). Link to nutrition — digestion breaks food down so nutrients can be absorbed into the blood.

**Common misconceptions:** Children commonly think the stomach is the main organ of digestion, when in fact most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption occurs in the small intestine. Some pupils believe food passes through the body in one tube with the stomach at the bottom, rather than understanding the winding path through distinct organs with different functions. Children may think digestion is only mechanical (chewing), not understanding the role of chemical breakdown by enzymes and acid.

**Key vocabulary:** digestive system, mouth, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, saliva, chew, digest, absorb, nutrient, enzyme, acid, peristalsis, breakdown, organ

#### SC-KS2-C032 — Types and Functions of Teeth
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding that humans have different types of teeth with different functions: incisors (cutting), canines (tearing), premolars and molars (grinding). Diet of carnivores and herbivores relates to different tooth structures.

**Teaching guidance:** Examine real or model teeth to identify the four types: incisors (flat, sharp, at the front — for cutting and biting), canines (pointed — for tearing), premolars and molars (flat, broad — for crushing and grinding). Use mirrors for pupils to examine their own teeth and identify each type. Compare human teeth with those of herbivores (flat, ridged molars for grinding plants) and carnivores (large canines and carnassials for tearing meat). Link tooth type to diet and feeding behaviour. Discuss dental health: the role of bacteria and sugar in tooth decay, and how brushing and diet protect teeth. Consider using disclosing tablets to show plaque.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think humans have only two types of teeth (front teeth and back teeth) rather than four types with distinct functions. Some pupils believe that baby teeth do not matter because they will fall out, not understanding that decay can affect the permanent teeth developing beneath. Children may think herbivores have no sharp teeth at all — in fact, many herbivores have sharp incisors for cutting grass and leaves.

**Key vocabulary:** incisor, canine, premolar, molar, cut, tear, grind, crush, tooth, teeth, enamel, decay, dentine, pulp, root, crown, carnivore, herbivore, omnivore, plaque

#### SC-KS2-C033 — Food Chains with Producers, Predators and Prey
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Constructing and interpreting food chains that include producers (plants), consumers, predators and prey. Understanding that food chains show the flow of energy and that producers are always the starting point. Extends KS1 simple food chains.

**Teaching guidance:** Build food chains using real organisms from a local habitat, starting with a producer (green plant) and showing energy flow through arrows. Emphasise that the arrow means 'is eaten by' or 'provides energy for', not 'eats'. Introduce the terms producer, consumer, predator and prey explicitly. Construct multiple food chains from the same habitat and discuss what happens if one organism is removed — does the chain collapse? Use food chain card games where pupils assemble chains from shuffled organism cards. Link to habitats work and classification.

**Common misconceptions:** The most common error is drawing food chain arrows in the wrong direction — arrows should point from the organism being eaten to the organism doing the eating, showing the direction of energy flow. Children often think predators are always large, fierce animals and do not recognise that a ladybird eating an aphid is also a predator-prey relationship. Some pupils believe removing one organism from a food chain only affects the organism directly above or below it, not understanding the cascading effects.

**Key vocabulary:** food chain, producer, consumer, predator, prey, energy, arrow, habitat, organism, plant, herbivore, carnivore, top predator, population, depend

#### SC-KS2-C046 — Human Development and Ageing
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding the full sequence of human development from birth through childhood, puberty, adulthood and old age. Changes at puberty are introduced. Timeline of growth stages. Gestation period concept.

**Teaching guidance:** Create a human timeline showing the stages from birth through infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood and old age, using photographs to illustrate each stage. Discuss the physical changes at each stage — growth in height and weight, development of teeth, puberty changes (growth spurts, body shape changes, development of secondary sexual characteristics). Handle puberty sensitively, following school RSE policy and ensuring a safe environment for questions. Compare human development timelines with those of other animals — some develop rapidly (mice), others slowly (elephants). Discuss gestation periods of different mammals.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think puberty happens at the same age for everyone, not understanding that there is a wide normal range (typically 8-14 for onset). Some pupils believe that growing old means the body simply wears out, rather than understanding that ageing involves specific biological processes. Children may not recognise that human development is much slower than most other mammals — a cat reaches adulthood in about one year.

**Key vocabulary:** development, growth, baby, toddler, child, adolescent, teenager, adult, elderly, puberty, gestation, stage, life span, ageing, mature, reproduce

#### SC-KS2-C060 — Circulatory System
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding the main parts of the human circulatory system: heart (pump), blood vessels (arteries carry oxygenated blood from heart, veins return deoxygenated blood, capillaries enable exchange). Blood transports nutrients, oxygen and waste. Functions of each component.

**Teaching guidance:** Use a large diagram or 3D model of the heart showing its chambers, valves and connected blood vessels. Demonstrate the pumping action by squeezing a rubber ball to simulate heartbeats. Measure pulse rate before and after exercise to show the heart responds to the body's needs. Trace the route of blood: heart → arteries → capillaries (where exchange occurs) → veins → heart → lungs (for oxygen) → heart. Use red and blue to distinguish oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in diagrams. Discuss the role of blood in transporting oxygen, nutrients and waste. Link to the respiratory system — the lungs oxygenate blood before it returns to the heart.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think the heart is on the left side of the chest — it is actually roughly central, slightly to the left. Some pupils believe blood is blue in veins and red in arteries — blood is always red; deoxygenated blood is dark red, not blue (veins appear blue through the skin due to how light penetrates tissue). Children may think the heart only pumps blood one way, not understanding the double circulation through the lungs and around the body.

**Key vocabulary:** heart, blood, blood vessel, artery, vein, capillary, pump, oxygenated, deoxygenated, oxygen, circulatory system, pulse, chamber, valve, lung, transport, cell

#### SC-KS2-C061 — Diet, Exercise, Drugs and Lifestyle
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding that diet, exercise, drugs and lifestyle choices affect how the body functions. Both beneficial choices (regular exercise, balanced diet) and harmful choices (drugs, poor diet) have impacts on body function and health.

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate the effects of exercise on heart rate and breathing rate through practical measurement — measure resting pulse, exercise for 2 minutes, then measure pulse again at intervals. Discuss the components of a balanced diet using the Eatwell Guide, linking nutrient types to body functions (protein for growth and repair, carbohydrates for energy, fats for insulation and energy). Discuss the impact of harmful substances — tobacco on lungs and circulation, alcohol on the liver and brain — using age-appropriate resources. Explore lifestyle choices: sleep, hydration, mental health. Use case studies or role-play scenarios where characters make different lifestyle choices and discuss the consequences.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think 'drugs' only refers to illegal substances, not understanding that medicines, caffeine and alcohol are also drugs. Some pupils believe that exercise is only beneficial if you are overweight, rather than understanding its benefits for cardiovascular health, mental health and bone strength regardless of weight. Children may think a 'balanced diet' means eating equal amounts of all food groups, rather than proportions recommended in the Eatwell Guide.

**Key vocabulary:** diet, exercise, balanced, healthy, nutrient, drug, tobacco, alcohol, lifestyle, heart rate, breathing rate, energy, protein, carbohydrate, fat, vitamin, organ, wellbeing

#### SC-KS2-C062 — Nutrient and Water Transport in Animals
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding that the circulatory system transports nutrients (absorbed from the small intestine) and water to all cells in the body. Blood is the transport medium. This links the digestive system output to the circulatory system.

**Teaching guidance:** Link the digestive system (studied in Y4) to the circulatory system: nutrients absorbed through the wall of the small intestine enter the blood and are transported to cells throughout the body. Use diagrams showing blood capillaries surrounding the small intestine to illustrate absorption. Discuss what happens to water — absorbed mainly in the large intestine and transported by blood. Trace the journey of a nutrient molecule from food on the plate through digestion, absorption, transport in blood and delivery to a cell. This concept bridges Y4 digestion knowledge with Y6 circulation knowledge, building an integrated understanding of body systems working together.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think food goes directly from the stomach to the rest of the body without understanding the role of the small intestine in absorption and the blood in transport. Some pupils believe the body uses food in its original form (e.g., a piece of bread reaching the muscles) rather than understanding that food must be broken down into tiny dissolved nutrient molecules. Children may not connect the digestive and circulatory systems as working together.

**Key vocabulary:** nutrient, water, transport, blood, circulatory system, digestive system, absorb, small intestine, large intestine, cell, capillary, dissolve, deliver, oxygen, waste, organ system

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS2-D003-CL001:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Body parts, organs and systems are understood by connecting their physical structure to their biological function — why is the heart shaped as it is, and how does that shape enable pumping?
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Systems and System Models**: What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Bodily systems (circulatory, digestive, skeletal) are interacting systems; tracing inputs, outputs and feedback between them deepens the structural understanding.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'

**SC-KS2-D003-CL002:**
- **Evidence and Argument** (primary): What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: This science cluster requires pupils to gather observations, evaluate their reliability, and construct evidence-based conclusions — the core of scientific thinking.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Understanding natural phenomena involves identifying causal mechanisms; pupils ask why things happen and what would change if conditions were different.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

**SC-KS2-D003-CL003:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Food chains, food webs and ecosystems are system models: pupils map components (producers, consumers, decomposers), trace energy flows, and predict what happens when one part changes.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Stability and Change**: What keeps this stable, what causes change, and how quickly does change happen?
  Why: Ecosystems maintain dynamic equilibria that can be disrupted by changes to one component — exploring what keeps the system stable and what destabilises it is an equally powerful framing.
  AI instruction: Use the STABILITY AND CHANGE lens: prompt pupils to identify what conditions keep a system in balance, what disrupts equilibrium, and how change can be gradual or sudden. Useful questions: 'What keeps this the same?', 'What would tip it into change?', 'Is the change reversible?', 'How fast is this changing, and why?'

**SC-KS2-D003-CL004:**
- **Evidence and Argument** (primary): What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: This science cluster requires pupils to gather observations, evaluate their reliability, and construct evidence-based conclusions — the core of scientific thinking.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'

## Domain: SC-KS2-D004 — Rocks
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
The Rocks domain introduces pupils to the geological materials that make up the Earth's surface, providing a foundation for understanding Earth processes, the rock cycle and the fossil record. Pupils compare and group rocks on the basis of their appearance and physical properties, and learn to distinguish between sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic rocks. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to describe how fossils are formed and understand what they tell us about living things that existed millions of years ago, connecting palaeontology to the concept of evolution. Pupils also study soil, understanding its composition and the role of living organisms and weathering processes in soil formation.

### Concepts (3)

#### SC-KS2-C019 — Rock Classification
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that rocks can be grouped and compared based on appearance and physical properties such as grain size, crystal structure, hardness, porosity, and whether they contain fossils. Examples: igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic (informal introduction).

**Teaching guidance:** Provide a collection of rock samples for hands-on investigation. Test rocks for hardness (scratch test), permeability (water drop test), appearance (crystal/grain examination with hand lens), and reaction to acid (vinegar test for limestone). Use the tests to group rocks rather than simply memorising names. Introduce the three rock types informally: rocks formed from cooled magma (igneous, e.g., granite, basalt), rocks formed from compressed layers (sedimentary, e.g., sandstone, chalk, limestone), and rocks changed by heat and pressure (metamorphic, e.g., marble, slate). Link to local geology where possible.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think all rocks are hard and heavy — pumice floats on water, chalk crumbles easily. Some pupils believe rocks are unchanging and permanent, not understanding that rocks are slowly broken down by weathering and reformed over geological time. Children may confuse rocks with minerals, or think that 'sedimentary' means the rock contains mud rather than understanding the process of layers being compressed.

**Key vocabulary:** rock, mineral, grain, crystal, hard, soft, permeable, sedimentary, igneous, metamorphic, limestone, sandstone, granite, chalk, slate, marble, fossil, appearance, property

#### SC-KS2-C020 — Fossil Formation
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding in simple terms how fossils are formed when the remains or traces of living things are trapped within sedimentary rock over millions of years. Fossils provide evidence of past life on Earth.

**Teaching guidance:** Use a layered modelling activity to demonstrate fossil formation: press plastic animals or shells into soft clay or plaster of Paris, then layer 'sediment' on top. Discuss the timescale — millions of years — and why only hard parts (bones, shells, teeth) typically fossilise. Examine real or replica fossils and ask pupils to identify which living things they came from. Discuss Mary Anning's contributions to palaeontology as a historical case study. Link fossil evidence to the concept that Earth has changed over time and that organisms that lived long ago may differ from those alive today.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think fossils are the actual bones of the animal rather than mineralised replacements or impressions in rock. Some pupils believe dinosaur bones are found complete and assembled, rather than as scattered fragments requiring reconstruction. Children may not grasp the immense timescales involved — they tend to underestimate geological time by orders of magnitude.

**Key vocabulary:** fossil, remains, sediment, sedimentary rock, preserved, impression, millions of years, palaeontologist, evidence, extinct, organism, shell, bone, trace, decay

#### SC-KS2-C021 — Soil Composition
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that soils are made from rock particles (formed by weathering) and organic matter (decayed living material). Different soils have different properties depending on their rock and organic matter composition.

**Teaching guidance:** Collect soil samples from different locations around the school grounds and compare them. Shake soil in water to separate layers — gravel sinks first, then sand, then silt, with organic material floating. Use hand lenses to examine soil closely and identify fragments of rock, decayed leaves, roots and small organisms. Discuss how soil forms from the breakdown of rocks (physical and chemical weathering) combined with decomposed plant and animal material. Connect to the rock cycle and the role of living organisms (earthworms, fungi, bacteria) in soil formation.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think soil is just 'dirt' with no particular composition or structure. Some pupils believe soil has always existed and do not connect it to the breakdown of rocks. Children may not realise that soil contains living organisms — bacteria, fungi, worms — that are essential for its formation and fertility. Some pupils think all soils are the same, not recognising that different soils have different properties.

**Key vocabulary:** soil, rock, particle, sand, silt, clay, organic matter, humus, weathering, decompose, earthworm, mineral, erosion, fertile, layer, compost

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS2-D004-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Sorting, classifying and identifying similarities directly trains pupils to recognise regularities and use them to predict or generalise.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Evidence and Argument**: What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Drawing conclusions from observations requires constructing a claim supported by specific evidence — not just describing what was seen.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'

**SC-KS2-D004-CL002:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Earth science topics involve large-scale systems (water cycle, solar system, rock cycle) where components interact in cycles — mapping the system helps pupils understand processes they cannot directly observe.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Stability and Change**: What keeps this stable, what causes change, and how quickly does change happen?
  Why: Geological, atmospheric and astronomical systems exhibit both stability (seasons repeat, rock types persist) and change (erosion, climate shifts), making stability-and-change a productive alternative framing.
  AI instruction: Use the STABILITY AND CHANGE lens: prompt pupils to identify what conditions keep a system in balance, what disrupts equilibrium, and how change can be gradual or sudden. Useful questions: 'What keeps this the same?', 'What would tip it into change?', 'Is the change reversible?', 'How fast is this changing, and why?'

### Objectives (3)

Key vocabulary: igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic, fossil, soil, mineral, permeable, erosion
Assessment: Can pupils group rocks using observable properties (hardness, grain, permeability)? Can they explain the three main rock types? Can they describe how fossils form in sedimentary rock? Can they explain what soil is made of?
Success criteria: Group rocks by at least 3 observable properties; Name the three main rock types with an example of each; Describe the process of fossil formation in sequence; Explain that soil is made from rock fragments and organic material

## Domain: SC-KS2-D005 — Light
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
The Light domain at KS2 requires pupils to understand light as a physical phenomenon — how it is produced, how it travels and how it interacts with materials. Pupils discover that light travels in straight lines and that we see because light enters the eye, correcting common misconceptions from younger years. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to investigate how shadows are formed and how their size and shape relate to the position of the light source, and to understand reflection as the mechanism by which mirrors and smooth surfaces change the direction of light. Pupils also explore how light is refracted, providing the conceptual foundation for understanding how lenses and optical instruments work.

### Concepts (4)

#### SC-KS2-C022 — Light and Vision
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that light is needed to see — dark is the absence of light. In Year 3, this is the observable phenomenon; in Year 6, it is explained using the model that light travels in straight lines from sources to eyes or via reflection.

**Teaching guidance:** Create a dark den or use a blacked-out area to explore the concept that we need light to see. Demonstrate that in complete darkness we cannot see at all — dark is the absence of light, not a substance. Introduce the idea that we see objects because light from a source reaches our eyes — either directly from a light source (sun, lamp, candle) or after reflecting off objects. Discuss sun safety: never look directly at the sun. Compare objects that produce their own light (luminous — sun, torch, candle) with those that reflect light (non-luminous — moon, most objects).

**Common misconceptions:** The most common misconception is that we can see in complete darkness if we 'wait long enough for our eyes to adjust'. In complete darkness (no light at all), we cannot see anything. Children often believe the Moon produces its own light — it reflects sunlight. Some pupils think darkness is a substance that can be 'pushed away' by light, rather than understanding darkness as the absence of light.

**Key vocabulary:** light, dark, light source, luminous, reflect, shadow, see, eye, torch, candle, sun, absence, visible, darkness, bright, dim

#### SC-KS2-C023 — Reflection of Light
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that light is reflected from surfaces, including mirrors and other reflective materials. In Year 3 this is observed; in Year 6 it is explained using the straight-line travel model.

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate reflection using mirrors, torches and darkened rooms. Show that shiny, smooth surfaces (mirrors, foil, still water) reflect light well, while rough or dark surfaces reflect less light. Use mirrors to redirect a torch beam around obstacles. Introduce the idea that we see most objects because light bounces off them into our eyes — even non-shiny objects reflect some light. Compare reflections in flat mirrors (clear image) with curved mirrors (distorted image). Connect to everyday applications: bicycle reflectors, reflective clothing, cat's eyes on roads.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think that only shiny objects like mirrors reflect light. In fact, all visible objects reflect some light — that is how we see them. Some pupils believe that light only comes from very bright sources and do not recognise that a candle or even a glow-worm is a light source. Children may think reflection only occurs in mirrors, not understanding that water, polished floors and even walls reflect light.

**Key vocabulary:** reflect, reflection, mirror, surface, shiny, smooth, light, bounce, torch, image, beam, direction, reflective, visible, angle

#### SC-KS2-C024 — Shadow Formation
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that shadows are formed when light from a source is blocked by an opaque object. In Year 3, the pattern of shadow size changes is explored. In Year 6, shadow shape is explained using the straight-line travel model.

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate shadows using torches and opaque objects in a darkened area. Explore how shadow size changes with the distance between the light source and the object — closer to the light makes a larger shadow, closer to the screen makes a smaller shadow. Investigate how shadow shape relates to the shape of the object. Classify materials as opaque (blocks all light, creates shadow), translucent (lets some light through, creates faint shadow) or transparent (lets most light through, no shadow). In Year 6, revisit shadows and explain their sharp edges using the model that light travels in straight lines.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think shadows have colour or are reflections of objects rather than areas where light has been blocked. Some pupils believe shadows are always the same size as the object, not understanding how distance from the light source affects shadow size. Children may think transparent objects have no effect on light at all, when in fact they can refract (bend) light passing through them.

**Key vocabulary:** shadow, opaque, translucent, transparent, light source, block, screen, shape, size, dark, bright, edge, outline, torch, distance

#### SC-KS2-C067 — Light Travels in Straight Lines
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

The explanatory model that light travels in straight lines from sources. This model explains why we see objects (light reaches our eyes directly from sources or via reflection), why shadows have the same shape as the object casting them, and how optical instruments work.

**Teaching guidance:** Demonstrate that light travels in straight lines by shining a torch through a series of cards with holes — the light only reaches the end if all holes are aligned. Use laser pointers (teacher-operated, safely) in a dusty or misty room to show the straight beam. Apply the straight-line model to explain how shadows have the same shape as the opaque object — draw ray diagrams showing light blocked by the object. Explain how we see objects: light from a source reflects off an object and travels in a straight line to our eyes. Use ray diagrams to model this process. Revisit shadow formation from Y3 and explain it using this model.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think light travels from the eye to the object (emission theory) rather than from the object to the eye. This misconception has deep historical roots and is very persistent. Some pupils believe light can bend around corners — it cannot without a reflective or refractive surface. Children may think shadows are dark because they contain something (a dark substance) rather than understanding that a shadow is simply an area where light does not reach.

**Key vocabulary:** light, straight line, ray, beam, source, reflect, eye, shadow, opaque, ray diagram, travel, block, illuminate, direction, model, refract

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS2-D005-CL001:**
- **Cause and Effect** (primary): What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Fair testing and investigations are designed to isolate variables and establish causal relationships — the cognitive demand is reasoning from controlled evidence to causal claims.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Data from repeated investigations reveals patterns that allow pupils to generalise their findings beyond the specific test conditions.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

## Domain: SC-KS2-D006 — Forces and Magnets
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Forces and Magnets at KS2 introduces pupils to the concept of force as an interaction between objects, progressing from the intuitive, qualitative understanding of push and pull in KS1 to a more systematic, measurable account. Pupils investigate how objects move on different surfaces, understanding friction as a force that opposes motion, and explore the properties of magnets — attraction, repulsion and the existence of magnetic fields. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to distinguish between contact forces (friction, air resistance, water resistance) and non-contact forces (gravity, magnetic and electrostatic forces), comparing how objects move on different surfaces. This foundational understanding of forces prepares pupils for the more mathematical treatment of Newton's laws at KS3.

### Concepts (3)

#### SC-KS2-C025 — Contact and Non-Contact Forces
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that most forces require direct contact between objects (e.g., pushing, pulling, friction) but some forces, notably magnetic forces and gravity, can act at a distance without direct contact.

**Teaching guidance:** Explore contact forces through practical activities: pushing and pulling objects, observing friction between surfaces, and feeling the resistance of water when moving objects through it. Introduce non-contact forces using magnets (attraction and repulsion without touching) and dropping objects (gravity pulls without touching). Create a two-column sorting activity: 'forces that need touching' versus 'forces that act at a distance'. Use force arrows to represent the direction of forces on simple diagrams. Discuss everyday examples of both types.

**Common misconceptions:** Children commonly think a force is needed to keep an object moving, rather than understanding that forces are needed to start, stop or change movement (a precursor to Newton's first law). Some pupils believe gravity only acts on heavy objects or only works at large distances. Children may think that magnetic force requires contact because they usually see magnets touching metal objects — they need to explore magnetic attraction through materials and at a distance.

**Key vocabulary:** force, push, pull, contact, non-contact, friction, gravity, magnetic, attract, repel, distance, surface, direction, strength, interaction

#### SC-KS2-C026 — Magnetic Properties
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that magnets attract some materials (magnetic materials, principally metals containing iron, nickel or cobalt) and not others. Magnets have two poles (north and south); like poles repel and unlike poles attract. Magnetic force acts at a distance.

**Teaching guidance:** Provide a collection of magnets (bar, horseshoe, ring) and a variety of materials for systematic testing. Challenge pupils to predict and then test which materials are attracted to magnets, recording results in a table. Investigate magnetic poles: demonstrate that like poles repel and unlike poles attract using bar magnets on a smooth surface or suspended from string. Explore the magnetic field using iron filings on paper above a bar magnet. Test whether magnetic force acts through materials (paper, wood, plastic, water) by trying to move a paper clip through a table. Investigate which metals are magnetic — only iron, nickel and cobalt, not all metals.

**Common misconceptions:** The most widespread misconception is that all metals are magnetic. Only iron, nickel, cobalt and their alloys (e.g., steel) are magnetic — copper, aluminium, gold and silver are not. Children often think magnets are strongest in the middle rather than at the poles. Some pupils believe bigger magnets are always stronger than smaller ones, which is not necessarily true as strength depends on the material and magnetisation.

**Key vocabulary:** magnet, magnetic, attract, repel, pole, north, south, iron, nickel, cobalt, force, field, material, metal, non-magnetic, bar magnet, horseshoe magnet

#### SC-KS2-C027 — Friction and Movement on Surfaces
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that the surface of an object affects how it moves — rough surfaces produce more friction and slow objects down more than smooth surfaces. Friction is a contact force.

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate friction by rolling a toy car down a ramp onto different surfaces (carpet, sandpaper, smooth wood, lino) and measuring the distance it travels. Use force meters to pull objects across different surfaces and compare the readings. Discuss why shoes have treads, why tyres have grip patterns, and why ice is slippery. Explore the idea that friction can be both useful (brakes, grip) and a nuisance (wear, heat, slowing down). Connect to the concept that rougher surfaces produce more friction than smoother ones.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think that smooth objects have no friction at all, rather than understanding that all surfaces produce some friction when in contact. Some pupils believe friction only slows things down and do not recognise its essential role in enabling movement — without friction, we could not walk, drive or hold objects. Children may think friction is only related to the roughness of surfaces, not understanding that weight and surface area also play a role.

**Key vocabulary:** friction, surface, rough, smooth, grip, slide, resistance, force, contact, ramp, distance, slow down, speed up, useful, nuisance, force meter

Sequenced after: SC-KS2-D006-CL001
Concepts: SC-KS2-C026 (Magnetic Properties)
Rationale: Magnetic properties (attraction, repulsion, poles, magnetic materials) constitute a distinct investigable topic with clear KS2 practical activities; magnetism as a non-contact force connects to C025.
Inspired by: NGSS PS2.B - Types of Interactions

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS2-D006-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Sorting, classifying and identifying similarities directly trains pupils to recognise regularities and use them to predict or generalise.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Evidence and Argument**: What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Drawing conclusions from observations requires constructing a claim supported by specific evidence — not just describing what was seen.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'

**SC-KS2-D006-CL002:**
- **Cause and Effect** (primary): What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Fair testing and investigations are designed to isolate variables and establish causal relationships — the cognitive demand is reasoning from controlled evidence to causal claims.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Data from repeated investigations reveals patterns that allow pupils to generalise their findings beyond the specific test conditions.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

#### SC-KS2-CV001 — Friction Investigation (investigation)
Fair test investigation into how surface type affects friction. Pupils measure distance a toy car travels on different surfaces.
Delivers: SC-KS2-C002, SC-KS2-C003, SC-KS2-C005, SC-KS2-C025, SC-KS2-C027
Enquiry type: fair_test
Equipment: ramp, toy car, metre stick, surface samples (carpet, wood, sandpaper, tile, fabric), masking tape
Expected outcome: Rougher surfaces produce more friction, so the car travels a shorter distance. Smooth surfaces produce less friction.
Key vocabulary: friction, force, contact force, surface, fair test, variable, conclusion
Assessment: Can pupils identify and control variables to make the test fair? Can they measure accurately and record in a table? Can they explain their results using the concept of friction as a contact force?
Success criteria: Identify the independent, dependent, and controlled variables; Measure distance travelled accurately using standard units; Record results in a table and present as a bar chart; Explain results using the concept of friction

## Domain: SC-KS2-D007 — Living Things and Their Habitats
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Living Things and Their Habitats at KS2 develops pupils' ecological understanding, moving from the simple identification of living and non-living things at KS1 to an understanding of the relationships between organisms and their environments. Pupils classify living things into broad groups (plants, animals, fungi, micro-organisms) using observable characteristics, and understand how classification systems are constructed and used by scientists. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to explore how habitats provide for the basic needs of different organisms, to construct and interpret food chains, and to understand how changes to an environment can affect the living things that depend on it. Pupils are introduced to the concepts of producer, consumer, predator and prey.

### Concepts (7)

#### SC-KS2-C028 — Classification Keys
Type: skill | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Using and making simple branching keys (dichotomous keys) to identify and classify living things by asking yes/no questions about observable characteristics. An important tool in biological identification.

**Teaching guidance:** Begin with teacher-made branching keys that pupils use to identify specimens (leaves, minibeasts, shells). Progress to pupils creating their own keys by choosing yes/no questions based on observable characteristics. Start with familiar objects (e.g., sorting classroom items) before moving to living organisms. Emphasise that good key questions focus on observable, unambiguous features rather than subjective qualities. Use local habitats for fieldwork — identify organisms found in the school grounds using published keys, then create a key for the organisms found.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often write key questions based on subjective criteria ('Is it pretty?') rather than observable, measurable features ('Does it have more than six legs?'). Some children think a key must lead to only one correct answer at each branch, not understanding that keys are tools for narrowing down possibilities based on available evidence. Children may confuse classification keys with identification guides that use pictures rather than questions.

**Key vocabulary:** classification key, branching key, dichotomous, identify, characteristic, feature, observable, yes/no, question, group, sort, organism, specimen, distinguish

#### SC-KS2-C029 — Variety of Classification Criteria
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding that living things can be grouped in many different ways depending on the characteristics chosen as criteria. No single correct grouping — different criteria produce different and equally valid classifications.

**Teaching guidance:** Provide the same set of organisms (or pictures) and challenge groups to classify them using different criteria: habitat, diet, body covering, number of legs, method of reproduction. Compare the different groupings that result and discuss which are most useful for different purposes. Introduce the idea that scientists choose classification criteria carefully and that the system we use today is based on evolutionary relationships. Use Venn diagrams and Carroll diagrams to explore overlapping and non-overlapping criteria. Discuss why some organisms are difficult to classify.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think there is only one correct way to classify organisms, not recognising that different criteria produce different but equally valid groupings. Some pupils classify animals by where they live rather than by biological features — for example, grouping whales with fish because they live in water. Children may struggle with organisms that do not fit neatly into one group, such as platypuses (mammals that lay eggs).

**Key vocabulary:** classify, group, criteria, characteristic, feature, similar, different, sort, compare, habitat, structure, Venn diagram, Carroll diagram, category, organism

#### SC-KS2-C030 — Environmental Change and Impact
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding that environments change over time (seasonal changes, human impact) and that these changes can sometimes pose dangers to living things. Includes positive and negative human impacts on environments.

**Teaching guidance:** Study a local habitat over time and record seasonal changes in the organisms present. Discuss both positive human impacts (nature reserves, reforestation, wildlife corridors) and negative impacts (pollution, deforestation, littering, urbanisation). Use case studies of environmental change — for example, the effect of hedgerow removal on bird populations, or the impact of river pollution on aquatic invertebrates. Investigate how changes in one part of a food chain affect other organisms. Link to geography work on land use and sustainability.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think environmental change is always negative and caused by humans, not recognising that natural changes (seasons, flooding, volcanic eruptions) also affect habitats. Some pupils believe that if an animal's habitat is destroyed, it can simply move to another habitat without difficulty. Children may not understand that changes to one species in a food chain have knock-on effects for other species in the same ecosystem.

**Key vocabulary:** environment, habitat, change, impact, pollution, deforestation, conservation, endangered, extinct, human, positive, negative, food chain, population, adapt, seasonal

#### SC-KS2-C044 — Comparative Life Cycles
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5 | Fan-out: 2

Describing and comparing the life cycles of four types of animals: mammals (live birth, parental care), amphibians (metamorphosis, aquatic larval stage), insects (complete or incomplete metamorphosis), birds (eggs, hatching, fledging). Understanding variety within the concept of life cycle.

**Teaching guidance:** Compare life cycles of mammals (e.g., human — live birth, extended parental care), amphibians (e.g., frog — eggs → tadpole → froglet → adult frog, metamorphosis), insects (e.g., butterfly — egg → caterpillar → chrysalis → butterfly, complete metamorphosis), and birds (e.g., robin — eggs → chick → fledgling → adult, hatching). Use diagrams to show each life cycle as a circular process. Create comparison tables highlighting similarities and differences. If possible, observe real life cycles — frog spawn developing, caterpillars pupating, chick eggs hatching. Discuss why different animals have evolved such different strategies.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think metamorphosis only applies to butterflies, not recognising it in frogs, beetles, and many other animals. Some pupils believe all animals are born as miniature versions of the adult (like mammals), not understanding that many go through dramatically different larval stages. Children may think a chrysalis is a resting state where nothing happens, rather than understanding that major body restructuring occurs inside.

**Key vocabulary:** life cycle, mammal, amphibian, insect, bird, metamorphosis, larva, pupa, tadpole, chrysalis, caterpillar, egg, hatch, fledgling, adult, offspring, gestation, stage

#### SC-KS2-C045 — Reproduction in Plants and Animals
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding the life process of reproduction. In plants: sexual reproduction (pollination, fertilisation, seed formation) and asexual reproduction (runners, bulbs, cuttings, tubers). In animals: sexual reproduction. Understanding that reproduction maintains species.

**Teaching guidance:** Distinguish between sexual reproduction (two parents, offspring show variation) and asexual reproduction (one parent, offspring genetically identical to parent). For plants: review pollination and seed formation as sexual reproduction, then investigate asexual methods — take cuttings from geraniums, plant strawberry runners, grow new plants from potato tubers and garlic bulbs. For animals: discuss sexual reproduction without detailed mechanism (appropriate to Y5). Compare sexual and asexual reproduction in terms of the variety of offspring produced. Link to evolution — sexual reproduction produces variation, which is the raw material for natural selection.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think all reproduction requires two parents, not understanding that many organisms (plants, some animals) can reproduce asexually. Some pupils confuse growth with reproduction — a plant getting bigger is growth, not reproduction. Children may believe that cuttings from a plant will produce a different variety of plant rather than an identical clone of the parent.

**Key vocabulary:** reproduction, sexual, asexual, offspring, parent, variation, identical, pollination, fertilisation, seed, cutting, runner, tuber, bulb, clone, species, inherit

#### SC-KS2-C058 — Formal Biological Classification
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding the formal biological classification system: broad groups of living things (micro-organisms, plants, animals) can be subdivided. Animals classified as vertebrates (fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals) and invertebrates. Plants classified as flowering and non-flowering. Based on work of Carl Linnaeus.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce Linnaeus and his contribution to biological classification. Use a classification hierarchy diagram showing the broad groups: living things → plants and animals → further subdivisions. For animals, distinguish vertebrates (fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals) from invertebrates (insects, spiders, worms, snails, etc.). For plants, distinguish flowering from non-flowering plants (ferns, mosses, conifers). Introduce micro-organisms as a third major group alongside plants and animals. Use specimen collections or high-quality photographs to practise classification. Create classification posters showing the hierarchy with examples at each level.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think invertebrates are less important or less complex than vertebrates — invertebrates actually make up about 97% of all animal species. Some pupils classify organisms by habitat rather than biological features (putting dolphins with fish because they live in water). Children may not recognise that fungi are a separate group, not plants — fungi do not photosynthesise. Some pupils think classification is about personal preference rather than observable shared characteristics.

**Key vocabulary:** classification, Linnaeus, vertebrate, invertebrate, fish, amphibian, reptile, bird, mammal, insect, flowering plant, non-flowering plant, micro-organism, kingdom, group, characteristic, hierarchy

#### SC-KS2-C059 — Micro-organisms
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Introduction to micro-organisms as a broad group of living things too small to see with the naked eye. Included in the formal classification of living things. Not yet expected to classify into bacteria, fungi, viruses etc. at this stage.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce micro-organisms through practical examples: grow bread mould, observe yeast producing bubbles when mixed with warm water and sugar, discuss bacteria in yoghurt-making. Use microscope images or videos to show the diversity of micro-organisms. Discuss both helpful micro-organisms (yeast for bread, bacteria for decomposition, gut bacteria for digestion) and harmful ones (bacteria causing food poisoning, viruses causing illness). Link to hygiene — handwashing, food safety. Emphasise that micro-organisms are living things that are too small to see without a microscope. At this stage, pupils need not classify them into bacteria, viruses and fungi.

**Common misconceptions:** Children commonly believe that all micro-organisms are harmful 'germs', when many are essential for life — decomposition, digestion, food production. Some pupils think micro-organisms are not really alive because they cannot be seen. Children may confuse bacteria and viruses, thinking they are the same thing and can be treated the same way (antibiotics work against bacteria but not viruses). Some pupils think micro-organisms only exist in 'dirty' places.

**Key vocabulary:** micro-organism, microbe, bacteria, virus, fungi, yeast, mould, microscope, tiny, invisible, decompose, disease, hygiene, helpful, harmful, living

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS2-D007-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Sorting, classifying and identifying similarities directly trains pupils to recognise regularities and use them to predict or generalise.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Evidence and Argument**: What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Drawing conclusions from observations requires constructing a claim supported by specific evidence — not just describing what was seen.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'

**SC-KS2-D007-CL002:**
- **Cause and Effect** (primary): What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Fair testing and investigations are designed to isolate variables and establish causal relationships — the cognitive demand is reasoning from controlled evidence to causal claims.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Data from repeated investigations reveals patterns that allow pupils to generalise their findings beyond the specific test conditions.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**SC-KS2-D007-CL003:**

Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**SC-KS2-D007-CL004:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Food chains, food webs and ecosystems are system models: pupils map components (producers, consumers, decomposers), trace energy flows, and predict what happens when one part changes.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Stability and Change**: What keeps this stable, what causes change, and how quickly does change happen?
  Why: Ecosystems maintain dynamic equilibria that can be disrupted by changes to one component — exploring what keeps the system stable and what destabilises it is an equally powerful framing.
  AI instruction: Use the STABILITY AND CHANGE lens: prompt pupils to identify what conditions keep a system in balance, what disrupts equilibrium, and how change can be gradual or sudden. Useful questions: 'What keeps this the same?', 'What would tip it into change?', 'Is the change reversible?', 'How fast is this changing, and why?'

## Domain: SC-KS2-D008 — States of Matter
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
States of Matter at KS2 introduces pupils to the particle model as the scientific explanation for the properties and behaviour of solids, liquids and gases. Pupils compare and group materials together according to whether they are solid, liquid or gas at room temperature, and investigate the processes of evaporation and condensation in the context of the water cycle. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to observe that some materials change state when they are heated or cooled, and to measure or research the temperature at which this happens. This provides the conceptual foundation for understanding thermodynamics, chemical reactions and the physical geography of the water cycle at later stages.

### Concepts (3)

#### SC-KS2-C034 — Three States of Matter
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding that materials can be classified as solids, liquids or gases based on their observable properties. Solids hold their shape; liquids form a pool but not a pile; gases escape from unsealed containers and are not visible.

**Teaching guidance:** Sort a collection of materials into solids, liquids and gases based on observable properties. Investigate borderline cases — is sand a solid or a liquid? (Solid, because each grain is solid even though sand pours.) Is toothpaste a solid or a liquid? Introduce the particle model informally: in solids, particles are closely packed and vibrate in fixed positions; in liquids, particles are close but can move around each other; in gases, particles are far apart and move freely. Use physical modelling (pupils acting as particles) to represent each state. Explore gases by trapping air in syringes and balloons.

**Common misconceptions:** Children commonly think that powders (flour, sand, sugar) are liquids because they pour. They are collections of tiny solids. Some pupils think gases have no mass or do not exist because they are invisible — weighing a balloon before and after inflation can address this. Children may struggle with the concept that the same substance (e.g., water) can exist as a solid, liquid or gas depending on temperature.

**Key vocabulary:** solid, liquid, gas, state of matter, property, shape, volume, flow, pour, compress, particle, fixed, vibrate, container, material, classify

#### SC-KS2-C035 — Changes of State
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding that materials change state when heated or cooled: melting (solid to liquid), freezing (liquid to solid), evaporation/boiling (liquid to gas), condensation (gas to liquid). Temperature at which state changes occur can be measured in degrees Celsius.

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate changes of state practically: melt ice and chocolate, freeze water and fruit juice, observe evaporation from wet surfaces, and collect condensation on a cold mirror held above steam. Measure temperatures at which changes occur using thermometers. Create a diagram showing the cycle of changes: solid ⇌ liquid ⇌ gas, with heating arrows in one direction and cooling arrows in the other. Use the terms melting, freezing, evaporating, boiling and condensing precisely. Investigate factors that affect evaporation rate (temperature, surface area, air movement) through fair test investigations.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often confuse evaporation with boiling — evaporation occurs at any temperature from the surface of a liquid, while boiling occurs throughout the liquid at a specific temperature. Some pupils think that when water evaporates it disappears or ceases to exist, rather than becoming invisible water vapour in the air. Children may believe that melting and dissolving are the same process — melting is a change of state caused by heat, while dissolving is a solid mixing into a liquid.

**Key vocabulary:** melting, freezing, evaporation, boiling, condensation, solid, liquid, gas, change of state, temperature, degrees Celsius, thermometer, heat, cool, reversible, boiling point, melting point

#### SC-KS2-C036 — The Water Cycle
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding that evaporation and condensation are key processes in the water cycle. Water evaporates from oceans, lakes and land when heated; water vapour condenses to form clouds; precipitation returns water to the surface. Rate of evaporation increases with temperature.

**Teaching guidance:** Create a physical model of the water cycle using a sealed container with warm water, ice placed on top, and a heat source. Observe evaporation, condensation on the cool surface, and 'precipitation' dripping back down. Label each stage of the cycle and connect to the scientific terms learned in states of matter. Discuss where water evaporates from in nature (oceans, lakes, rivers, soil, plants) and what causes condensation (cooling of water vapour as it rises in the atmosphere). Link to geography — rivers, rainfall patterns, clouds. Investigate how temperature affects evaporation rate.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think clouds are made of water vapour — clouds are actually made of tiny liquid water droplets or ice crystals; water vapour is invisible. Some pupils believe rain falls from clouds when they 'get too heavy' or 'burst', rather than understanding the role of further condensation and coalescence. Children may think the water cycle is a one-way process (evaporation → rain) rather than a continuous cycle with water endlessly recycling.

**Key vocabulary:** water cycle, evaporation, condensation, precipitation, cloud, water vapour, temperature, heat, ocean, river, lake, rain, atmosphere, cycle, sun, energy

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS2-D008-CL001:**
- **Evidence and Argument** (primary): What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: This cluster asks pupils to gather, record or communicate scientific findings — the core cognitive demand is evaluating what counts as valid evidence and how to present it clearly.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Scientific observations and enquiry serve to establish causal relationships; framing questions around 'what causes X' gives purpose to the observation work.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

**SC-KS2-D008-CL002:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Material properties link physical structure (molecular arrangement, surface texture) to functional behaviour (waterproofing, strength, flexibility) — the key question is always 'why does this material behave this way?'
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Properties can be sorted and classified into patterns (metals conduct, insulators don't), allowing pupils to make predictions about unfamiliar materials.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

### Objectives (3)

## Domain: SC-KS2-D009 — Sound
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
The Sound domain requires pupils to understand sound as a physical phenomenon produced by vibration, and to explore the properties of sound — pitch, volume and the materials through which sound travels. Pupils identify how sounds are made (all sounds result from something vibrating), and understand that vibrations travel through a medium to the ear. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to investigate the relationship between the vibration of a string and the pitch of the sound produced, and to understand how sound is attenuated by distance. Pupils develop the ability to design fair test investigations, measuring and recording sound levels and making predictions about variables that affect pitch and volume.

### Concepts (4)

#### SC-KS2-C037 — Vibration as the Cause of Sound **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 4 | Fan-out: 3

Understanding that all sounds are made by vibrating objects. The vibration causes surrounding particles to vibrate, transmitting the sound as a wave through the medium (solid, liquid or gas) to the ear.

**Teaching guidance:** Explore sound production through hands-on activities: pluck a guitar string and watch it vibrate, strike a tuning fork and touch it to water to see splashing, tap a drum with rice grains on top to see them bounce, and hold a ruler over the edge of a desk and twang it. Use the common thread to establish the principle that all sounds come from something vibrating. Place a hand on the throat while humming to feel vocal cord vibration. Discuss how to stop a sound — stop the vibration (damping). Use the term 'vibration' consistently and ask pupils to identify what is vibrating in each example.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think sounds just 'happen' without anything vibrating, or that only musical instruments vibrate. They may not connect everyday sounds (speech, traffic, wind) to vibration. Some pupils think that when they hear a sound, the vibrating object has sent something physical to their ear rather than understanding that vibrations pass through the air as a wave.

**Key vocabulary:** sound, vibration, vibrate, source, wave, ear, hear, loud, quiet, pitch, tuning fork, instrument, drum, string, vocal cords, energy

#### SC-KS2-C038 — Sound Transmission Through Media
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding that vibrations from sounds travel through a medium (solid, liquid or gas) to the ear. Sound cannot travel through a vacuum. Sound travels through different media at different speeds.

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate sound travelling through different media: use a 'string telephone' to demonstrate sound travelling through a taut string (solid); listen to sounds underwater in a large container (liquid); compare sounds heard through air (gas). Press an ear to a desk while a partner taps the other end to hear sound travelling through a solid. Discuss why astronauts cannot hear each other in space — sound needs a medium and space is a vacuum. Compare how well sound travels through solids, liquids and gases. Use a bell in a vacuum jar demonstration (video if equipment unavailable) to show that sound cannot travel without a medium.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often believe sound can travel through a vacuum (influenced by science fiction films showing explosions in space). Some pupils think sound travels only through air and are surprised it can travel through solids and liquids. Children may believe sound travels at the same speed through all materials — it actually travels faster through solids than liquids, and faster through liquids than gases.

**Key vocabulary:** sound, vibration, travel, medium, solid, liquid, gas, vacuum, ear, wave, transmit, air, speed, distance, string telephone, particle

#### SC-KS2-C039 — Pitch and Sound Source Features
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding that the pitch of a sound is related to features of the object producing it. Longer, larger or looser objects produce lower pitch sounds. Shorter, smaller or tighter objects produce higher pitch sounds. Patterns can be found and investigated.

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate pitch using musical instruments: pluck guitar strings of different thickness and tension, blow across bottles filled to different levels, and use chime bars of different lengths. Identify the pattern: shorter, thinner and tighter objects produce higher-pitched sounds. Make a simple instrument (e.g., an elastic band guitar on a shoebox) and systematically change one variable at a time to observe its effect on pitch. Use tuning forks of different sizes to demonstrate the relationship between size and pitch. Connect to music curriculum — high and low notes on a keyboard or recorder.

**Common misconceptions:** Children commonly confuse pitch with volume — they may describe a high-pitched sound as 'loud' and a low-pitched sound as 'quiet'. Pitch and volume are independent properties. Some pupils think that only the length of an object affects pitch, not recognising that thickness and tension also play a role. Children may believe that bigger instruments always make lower sounds, which is generally true but not always (a piccolo is smaller than a flute but plays higher).

**Key vocabulary:** pitch, high, low, vibration, frequency, length, thickness, tension, tight, loose, long, short, thick, thin, instrument, note, tuning fork, pattern

#### SC-KS2-C040 — Volume and Vibration Strength
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Understanding that the volume (loudness) of a sound is related to the strength (amplitude) of the vibrations producing it. Stronger vibrations produce louder sounds. Sound becomes fainter as distance from the source increases.

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate volume by striking a drum with different amounts of force and observing the effect. Use a tuning fork: strike it gently and then firmly, observing larger vibrations producing louder sounds. Place rice grains on a drum skin and observe them bouncing higher with louder hits. Investigate how sound becomes fainter with distance — have one pupil clap while others stand at increasing distances and describe the volume. Discuss everyday applications: why we shout to be heard across a playground, why walls muffle sound, why ear defenders work. Use decibel meters or apps to measure sound levels.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often confuse volume (loudness) with pitch (high or low). They are independent — a sound can be loud and high, loud and low, quiet and high, or quiet and low. Some pupils think that louder sounds travel faster than quieter sounds — volume and speed of sound are unrelated. Children may not understand why sound gets fainter with distance, thinking the sound 'runs out' rather than understanding that sound energy spreads out over a larger area.

**Key vocabulary:** volume, loud, quiet, faint, vibration, amplitude, strength, force, distance, energy, decibel, sound level, ear, hear, muffle, absorb

**SC-KS2-D009-CL001:**
- **Cause and Effect** (primary): What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Fair testing and investigations are designed to isolate variables and establish causal relationships — the cognitive demand is reasoning from controlled evidence to causal claims.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes.

Enquiry type: pattern_seeking
Equipment: tuning forks, water tray, rulers, elastic bands, shoe boxes (string telephones), rice on drum skin

## Domain: SC-KS2-D010 — Electricity
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Electricity at KS2 introduces pupils to electric circuits as systems in which energy is transferred from a power source through components. Pupils construct simple series circuits and investigate the effects of adding or removing components, predicting whether a lamp will light based on whether the circuit is complete. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to understand the function of common circuit components — cells, wires, bulbs, switches and buzzers — and to use recognised circuit symbols to draw diagrams. By upper KS2, pupils investigate how circuit properties (voltage, number of cells, component type) affect the behaviour of the circuit, developing the quantitative understanding of electricity that is extended at KS3.

### Concepts (4)

#### SC-KS2-C041 — Series Electrical Circuits
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 2

Understanding that a simple series electrical circuit consists of components (cells, bulbs, switches, buzzers, wires) connected in a single unbroken loop. A lamp will only light when part of a complete circuit. In Year 6, circuits can be represented using standard symbols.

**Teaching guidance:** Provide circuit-building kits (cells, wires, bulbs, switches, buzzers, motors) and challenge pupils to make a bulb light up. Investigate what happens when the circuit is broken — the bulb goes out, demonstrating the need for a complete loop. Add switches and discuss their function as deliberate circuit breakers. In Year 4, use pictorial representations of circuits. In Year 6, introduce standard circuit symbols and teach pupils to draw and interpret circuit diagrams. Investigate what happens when more bulbs or more cells are added to a series circuit.

**Common misconceptions:** The most persistent misconception is that electricity 'flows out of' the battery into the bulb and is 'used up'. In fact, current flows in a complete loop and is not consumed — energy is transferred, not the charge itself. Some pupils think electricity flows from both ends of the battery and meets in the bulb ('clashing currents' model). Children may believe that the order of components in a series circuit matters — it does not for a simple series circuit.

**Key vocabulary:** circuit, series, cell, battery, wire, bulb, switch, buzzer, motor, loop, complete, break, component, electrical, current, flow, symbol, diagram

#### SC-KS2-C042 — Conductors and Insulators
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that some materials allow electricity to flow through them (conductors) while others do not (insulators). Metals tend to be good conductors. Insulators are used to protect us from electrical current and to prevent short circuits.

**Teaching guidance:** Build a test circuit with a gap and challenge pupils to test a variety of materials by placing them in the gap to see if the bulb lights. Test metals (copper, iron, aluminium, steel), non-metals (wood, plastic, rubber, glass, paper), and liquids (water, salt water). Record results in a table and look for patterns — metals generally conduct, non-metals generally do not. Discuss why electrical wires have metal cores (conductor) wrapped in plastic (insulator). Link to safety: insulators protect us from electric shocks; never touch bare wires or damaged cables.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think all metals are conductors and all non-metals are insulators. While this is broadly true, graphite (a non-metal) conducts electricity, and some metal oxides are poor conductors. Some pupils confuse electrical conductors with thermal conductors — a material can be good at conducting one but not the other. Children may think that water always conducts electricity — pure water is a poor conductor, but dissolved salts (as in tap water) make it conductive.

**Key vocabulary:** conductor, insulator, conduct, electricity, metal, non-metal, material, test, circuit, bulb, flow, current, copper, plastic, rubber, safety, protection

#### SC-KS2-C043 — Voltage and Circuit Effects
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding that the brightness of a lamp and the volume of a buzzer are associated with the number and voltage of cells in a circuit. More cells/higher voltage produces brighter bulbs and louder buzzers. Voltage is introduced informally.

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate the effect of adding more cells to a series circuit: with one cell the bulb is dim, with two cells it is brighter, with three cells it is very bright (and may blow). Use this to introduce the idea that more cells provide more 'push' (voltage) to the current. Compare circuits with different numbers of cells systematically, measuring brightness using a light sensor or ranking by observation. Discuss why we use different numbers of batteries in different devices (a torch needs fewer than a laptop). Introduce the volt as the unit of voltage. Predict and test what happens when cells are reversed.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often confuse voltage with current, thinking they are the same thing. Voltage is the 'push' or energy given to the current; current is the flow of charge. Some pupils think that adding more bulbs to a series circuit makes them all brighter (it actually makes them dimmer because the voltage is shared). Children may not understand why batteries go flat — the chemical energy is gradually converted to other forms.

**Key vocabulary:** voltage, volt, cell, battery, brightness, circuit, component, bulb, buzzer, current, push, energy, series, increase, decrease, effect, power

#### SC-KS2-C068 — Circuit Symbols and Diagrams
Type: skill | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 4 | Fan-out: 1

Using recognised standard symbols to represent components in circuit diagrams: cell, battery, bulb, switch, buzzer, wire. Ability to draw and interpret circuit diagrams using standard symbols, building on pictorial representations from Year 4.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach the standard circuit symbols systematically: cell (long and short parallel lines), battery (multiple cells), bulb (circle with cross), switch (break in line), buzzer (semicircle), wire (straight line), motor (circle with M). Provide printed symbol reference cards. Practise converting pictorial circuit drawings into standard symbol diagrams and vice versa. Build circuits from diagrams and draw diagrams from built circuits. Emphasise the advantages of standard symbols — they are understood internationally and remove ambiguity. Use circuit diagram puzzles where pupils predict whether a circuit will work based on the diagram. Link to Y4 practical circuit-building skills.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often confuse the symbols for a cell and a battery — a single cell has one long and one short line; a battery (multiple cells) has several pairs. Some pupils draw circuit diagrams with gaps or components floating rather than connected in a complete loop. Children may think the diagram represents the physical layout of the circuit rather than understanding it as a schematic representation — components do not need to be in the same spatial positions as in the real circuit.

**Key vocabulary:** circuit diagram, symbol, cell, battery, bulb, switch, buzzer, motor, wire, component, series, standard, represent, draw, interpret, connect, international

## Domain: SC-KS2-D011 — Properties and Changes of Materials
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Properties and Changes of Materials at upper KS2 requires pupils to compare and group materials based on physical properties — hardness, solubility, thermal conductivity, response to magnets, transparency — and to investigate mixtures and methods of separating them. Pupils understand that some changes (dissolving, mixing, changes of state) are reversible while others (burning, rusting, reactions involving new substances) are not, and learn to describe the differences using appropriate scientific language. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to investigate whether dissolving, mixing and changes of state produce new materials, providing the foundation for understanding chemical change at KS3.

### Concepts (5)

#### SC-KS2-C047 — Extended Material Properties
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5 | Fan-out: 1

Comparing and grouping materials based on a wider range of properties: hardness, solubility, transparency, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and response to magnets. Builds on KS1 and Y4 materials knowledge with additional property types.

**Teaching guidance:** Set up a systematic investigation of material properties using a range of tests: scratch test for hardness (compare wood, metal, plastic, stone), dissolving test for solubility (test sugar, sand, salt, chalk in water), transparency test (classify as transparent, translucent or opaque), thermal conductivity test (wrap identical cups of hot water in different materials and measure cooling rate), electrical conductivity test (insert into a circuit gap), and magnet test. Record results in a property comparison table. Discuss how property knowledge helps engineers and designers choose the right material for each purpose.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often confuse thermal conductivity with temperature — a metal spoon feels cold not because it is colder than a wooden spoon but because it conducts heat away from your hand faster. Some pupils think that if a material dissolves it has disappeared or been destroyed, rather than understanding it has dispersed into the liquid. Children may believe that hardness and strength are the same thing — glass is hard but brittle, while rubber is soft but strong.

**Key vocabulary:** property, hardness, solubility, transparency, conductivity, thermal, electrical, magnetic, opaque, translucent, transparent, dissolve, soluble, insoluble, compare, group, material, purpose

#### SC-KS2-C048 — Dissolving and Solutions
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding that some materials dissolve in liquid to form a solution — the solute appears to disappear but is not lost. Understanding that a dissolved substance can be recovered by evaporating the solvent. Dissolving is different from melting.

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate dissolving by adding salt, sugar, sand and chalk to water, stirring and observing. Weigh the water before and after dissolving salt to show the mass has increased — the salt is still there even though invisible. Investigate factors that affect dissolving rate: temperature, stirring, grain size. Recover a dissolved substance by evaporating the water — leave a saucer of salt solution on a warm windowsill and observe salt crystals forming. Explicitly distinguish dissolving from melting: dissolving requires a solvent (liquid), melting requires heat. Use the terms solute, solvent and solution consistently.

**Common misconceptions:** The most common misconception is confusing dissolving with melting. Dissolving requires a liquid (solvent); melting requires heat to change a solid to a liquid. Sugar dissolves in water; ice melts in warm air. Children often think that when something dissolves it has gone forever or been destroyed — weighing before and after proves the dissolved substance is still present. Some pupils think stirring makes more solid dissolve rather than simply speeding up the process.

**Key vocabulary:** dissolve, solution, solute, solvent, soluble, insoluble, filter, evaporate, recover, crystal, stir, temperature, rate, mass, disappear, transparent, mixture

#### SC-KS2-C049 — Separating Mixtures
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding that mixtures of solids, liquids and gases can be separated using various techniques: filtering (remove insoluble solids from liquids), sieving (separate solids by particle size), evaporating (recover dissolved solids). Technique chosen depends on properties of components.

**Teaching guidance:** Demonstrate each separation technique practically: use sieving to separate rice from flour; filtering to separate sand from water (using filter paper and funnel); evaporating to recover salt from salt water (using an evaporating dish over a water bath). Discuss which technique is appropriate for which mixture and why — sieving separates by particle size, filtering separates insoluble solids from liquids, evaporation separates dissolved solids from liquids. Challenge pupils with mystery mixtures to separate (e.g., salt, sand and iron filings — use magnet, then dissolve salt in water and filter, then evaporate). Link separation techniques to real-world applications: water purification, mining, recycling.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think that filtering can separate dissolved substances from water — it cannot; only evaporation or distillation works for solutions. Some pupils confuse sieving with filtering, not recognising the difference in particle size involved. Children may believe that once mixed, substances can never be separated, rather than understanding that different properties allow different separation methods.

**Key vocabulary:** separate, mixture, filter, sieve, evaporate, dissolve, insoluble, soluble, technique, method, filter paper, funnel, residue, filtrate, solution, particle, purify

#### SC-KS2-C050 — Reversible Changes
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that some material changes are reversible — the original materials can be recovered. Examples: dissolving, mixing, melting, freezing, evaporation, condensation. The material is changed in form but not in substance.

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate a range of reversible changes: melt chocolate and let it re-solidify; dissolve salt and evaporate to recover it; freeze water and melt the ice. Create a concept map linking all reversible changes, emphasising that the original materials can always be recovered and no new substance is formed. Compare each reversible change with an equivalent irreversible change — melting chocolate (reversible) versus burning toast (irreversible). Use the criterion 'Can we get the original material back?' as the key test. Discuss everyday examples: drying wet clothes (reversible evaporation of water), recycling metals by melting and reshaping.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think that all changes caused by heating are irreversible, not recognising that melting and evaporation are reversible. Some pupils believe dissolving is irreversible because they cannot see the solid, when in fact evaporation will recover it. Children may confuse reversible changes with the idea of 'undoing' something — reversibility means the original materials can be recovered, not that the exact same object is restored.

**Key vocabulary:** reversible, change, recover, original, material, melt, freeze, dissolve, evaporate, condense, mix, separate, substance, form, physical change, state

#### SC-KS2-C051 — Irreversible Changes
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding that some changes result in the formation of new materials and are not easily reversed. Examples: burning, rusting, acid reacting with bicarbonate of soda, cooking. New substances are formed that cannot easily be changed back.

**Teaching guidance:** Demonstrate irreversible changes safely: burn a piece of paper or candle (adult-supervised), mix vinegar with bicarbonate of soda to observe gas production, cook an egg, and observe rusting of iron wool in damp conditions over several days. In each case, discuss what evidence shows a new substance has formed — change in colour, production of gas, change in temperature, production of light or smoke. Contrast with reversible changes done in parallel: melt ice alongside burning a candle. Emphasise that irreversible changes produce new materials with different properties. Introduce the term 'chemical change' informally.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often struggle to distinguish irreversible from reversible changes. A useful test is: 'Has a new substance been formed with different properties?' Cooking an egg is irreversible — you cannot uncook it because the proteins have permanently changed. Some pupils think burning makes things disappear rather than producing new substances (ash, gases, smoke). Children may not recognise rusting as a chemical change because it happens slowly.

**Key vocabulary:** irreversible, chemical change, new substance, burn, rust, react, gas, temperature change, permanent, original, material, evidence, property, formation, combustion

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS2-D011-CL001:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Material properties link physical structure (molecular arrangement, surface texture) to functional behaviour (waterproofing, strength, flexibility) — the key question is always 'why does this material behave this way?'
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Properties can be sorted and classified into patterns (metals conduct, insulators don't), allowing pupils to make predictions about unfamiliar materials.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**SC-KS2-D011-CL002:**
- **Cause and Effect** (primary): What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Fair testing and investigations are designed to isolate variables and establish causal relationships — the cognitive demand is reasoning from controlled evidence to causal claims.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Data from repeated investigations reveals patterns that allow pupils to generalise their findings beyond the specific test conditions.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

## Domain: SC-KS2-D012 — Earth and Space
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Earth and Space at upper KS2 provides pupils with an understanding of the solar system, Earth's movements and the phenomena associated with them — day and night, seasons, phases of the Moon. Pupils learn that the Earth, along with other planets, orbits the Sun, and that the Moon orbits the Earth, using models and research to understand the relative sizes, distances and movements of these bodies. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to explain day and night as the result of Earth rotating on its axis, and to understand how this differs from the annual orbit of the Earth around the Sun. This provides important foundations for astronomical and geographical concepts at KS3 and beyond.

### Concepts (3)

#### SC-KS2-C052 — The Solar System
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that the Sun is a star at the centre of our solar system and that eight planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) orbit it. Heliocentric model replaced earlier geocentric model. History of scientific ideas including Ptolemy, Alhazen, Copernicus.

**Teaching guidance:** Create a scale model of the solar system using appropriately scaled spheres (or fruits) to show relative sizes, and use the school field or corridor to show relative distances (even scaled down, the distances are striking). Teach the order of the eight planets using a mnemonic (e.g., 'My Very Enthusiastic Mother Just Served Us Nachos'). Discuss the heliocentric model and its history — how Copernicus, Galileo and others challenged the geocentric model with evidence from observations. Use videos or planetarium software to visualise planetary orbits. Emphasise that the Sun is a star and that planets orbit it due to gravity.

**Common misconceptions:** Children commonly believe that the Sun orbits the Earth (geocentric model) because that matches everyday observation of the Sun 'moving' across the sky. Pupils often dramatically underestimate the distances between planets and overestimate the relative size of Earth compared to Jupiter or Saturn. Some children think stars and planets are the same thing — stars produce light, planets reflect it. Children may believe Pluto is still classified as a planet.

**Key vocabulary:** solar system, Sun, star, planet, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, orbit, heliocentric, geocentric, satellite, gravity, astronomer, Copernicus

#### SC-KS2-C053 — Earth's Rotation and Day/Night
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding that the Earth rotates on its axis once every 24 hours, causing day and night. The part of Earth facing the Sun experiences day; the opposite side experiences night. The Sun's apparent movement across the sky is explained by Earth's rotation, not the Sun moving.

**Teaching guidance:** Use a globe and a torch in a darkened room to model Earth's rotation and day/night. Mark the pupils' location on the globe and slowly rotate it to show how their location moves from day (facing the torch) to night (facing away). Emphasise that it is Earth rotating, not the Sun moving around Earth. Discuss time zones as evidence of Earth's rotation. Use the model to explain why the Sun appears to move across the sky during the day — we are rotating beneath a stationary Sun. Link to KS1 work on seasonal day length changes. Use slow-motion videos of sunrises and sunsets to reinforce that these are caused by Earth's rotation.

**Common misconceptions:** The most persistent misconception is that day and night are caused by the Sun going around the Earth. Some children think night occurs because the Moon or clouds block the Sun. Pupils may confuse Earth's daily rotation (causing day/night) with its yearly orbit around the Sun (causing seasons). Some children think that different countries have day and night at different times because the Sun travels to different places, rather than because Earth rotates.

**Key vocabulary:** Earth, rotate, rotation, axis, spin, day, night, Sun, globe, orbit, shadow, time zone, sunrise, sunset, 24 hours, apparent movement

#### SC-KS2-C054 — Moon's Orbit
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding that the Moon is a natural satellite that orbits the Earth. The Moon is approximately spherical. Other planets also have moons. The Moon's orbital relationship with Earth distinguishes it from planets.

**Teaching guidance:** Use a model with a torch (Sun), a large ball (Earth) and a small ball (Moon) to demonstrate the Moon orbiting Earth while Earth orbits the Sun. Observe the Moon over a month and record its appearance — noting the phases from new moon through crescent, quarter, gibbous to full moon and back. Discuss why the Moon appears to change shape (different portions illuminated as it orbits). Compare the Moon with planets — the Moon is a natural satellite, not a planet. Research other moons in the solar system (Jupiter's Galilean moons, Saturn's Titan). Emphasise that the Moon is approximately spherical.

**Common misconceptions:** Children commonly believe the Moon produces its own light — it reflects sunlight. Some pupils think the Moon's phases are caused by Earth's shadow falling on the Moon (that is a lunar eclipse, which is rare). Children may believe the Moon is only visible at night, when in fact it is often visible during the day. Some pupils think the Moon does not rotate, but it does — once per orbit, which is why we always see the same face.

**Key vocabulary:** Moon, orbit, satellite, natural satellite, Earth, phase, full moon, new moon, crescent, sphere, spherical, reflect, illuminate, rotate, month, lunar

Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS2-D012-CL001:**

## Domain: SC-KS2-D013 — Forces
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Forces at upper KS2 moves beyond the qualitative introduction of Year 3 to a more quantitative understanding, including gravity, air resistance, water resistance and mechanisms that can change the effect of forces. Pupils investigate how objects fall due to gravity and explore the effects of air resistance and water resistance in opposing motion. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to understand that some mechanisms — levers, pulleys and gears — allow a smaller force to have a greater effect, introducing the concept of mechanical advantage. Pupils design and evaluate fair tests investigating factors that affect the force of air resistance or water resistance, developing their scientific investigation skills.

### Concepts (3)

#### SC-KS2-C055 — Gravity
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding that gravity is a non-contact force of attraction acting between the Earth and objects. Unsupported objects fall towards Earth because of gravity. Gravity is responsible for keeping planets in orbit around the Sun and the Moon in orbit around Earth.

**Teaching guidance:** Drop a range of objects (feather, ball, piece of paper, stone) and observe that unsupported objects fall due to gravity. Discuss why a feather falls more slowly than a ball — air resistance, not less gravity. Use the term 'gravitational force' or 'gravitational pull' and explain it as an attractive force between the Earth and all objects. Demonstrate that gravity acts on all objects regardless of mass by dropping two objects of different mass but similar shape from the same height. Discuss gravity's role in keeping planets orbiting the Sun and the Moon orbiting Earth. Connect to the concept of weight as a measure of gravitational force.

**Common misconceptions:** Children commonly believe heavier objects fall faster than lighter ones. In a vacuum they fall at the same rate — in air, differences are caused by air resistance, not gravity. Some pupils think gravity only exists on Earth or only works at the Earth's surface. Children may confuse mass and weight — mass is the amount of matter (measured in kg), weight is the gravitational force acting on that mass (measured in Newtons). Some pupils think there is no gravity in space.

**Key vocabulary:** gravity, gravitational force, attract, pull, weight, mass, fall, unsupported, orbit, Earth, Sun, Moon, Newton, force, non-contact, downward

#### SC-KS2-C056 — Resistance Forces
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding that air resistance, water resistance and friction are forces that act against motion between moving surfaces. These forces slow objects down and can be useful (parachutes, brakes) or a problem (inefficiency). Friction acts between surfaces in contact.

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate air resistance by dropping paper shapes of different sizes and observing fall rates. Design and test parachutes of different sizes and materials, measuring the time they take to fall a fixed distance. Investigate water resistance by pulling different shapes through water and comparing the force required. Compare friction on different surfaces using a force meter to pull a shoe across carpet, wood, tile and sandpaper. Discuss the design features of real objects that minimise resistance (streamlined cars, cyclists' clothing) or maximise it (parachutes, brake pads, non-slip shoes). Link to fair testing — changing one variable at a time.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think that moving objects have a force pushing them forward even after the push has stopped. Once no force acts, the object slows due to friction and air resistance. Some pupils believe friction only acts when objects are moving — static friction also acts to prevent objects from starting to move. Children may think that air resistance only affects large objects like parachutes, not recognising it acts on all moving objects.

**Key vocabulary:** air resistance, water resistance, friction, streamlined, drag, force, surface, parachute, shape, area, speed, slow down, oppose, motion, force meter, Newton

#### SC-KS2-C057 — Mechanisms as Force Multipliers
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding that simple mechanisms — levers, pulleys and gears — allow a smaller input force to have a greater effect. These machines do not create energy but redistribute force and distance. Applications in everyday tools and machines.

**Teaching guidance:** Investigate levers by using a ruler balanced on a pencil to lift objects — explore how moving the fulcrum changes the effort needed. Explore pulleys using a simple pulley system to lift a weight — compare the force needed with and without the pulley. Examine gears using construction kits (LEGO Technic, K'Nex) to see how different-sized gears change speed and force. Identify mechanisms in everyday objects: scissors (lever), bicycle gears, fishing rod (lever), flagpole (pulley), clock mechanism (gears). Emphasise that these mechanisms do not create energy — they trade force for distance. A small force over a large distance can move a large load a small distance.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think that machines create energy or force from nothing — they actually redistribute force and distance. A lever does not reduce the total work done; it allows a smaller force to be applied over a larger distance. Some pupils think pulleys only change the direction of force, not recognising that pulley systems with multiple wheels also provide mechanical advantage. Children may not recognise everyday objects (scissors, wheelbarrows, bottle openers) as levers.

**Key vocabulary:** mechanism, lever, pulley, gear, fulcrum, pivot, effort, load, force, distance, mechanical advantage, machine, simple machine, input, output, energy, transfer

Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS2-D013-CL001:**
- **Energy and Matter** (primary): Where does the energy come from, where does it go, and is anything conserved?
  Why: Energy clusters require pupils to trace where energy comes from, how it is transferred or transformed, and where it ends up — conservation and flow are the central ideas.
  AI instruction: Use the ENERGY AND MATTER lens: prompt pupils to trace energy pathways, identify transformations between energy forms, track matter through cycles, and apply conservation thinking. Useful questions: 'Where did the energy come from?', 'What happened to it?', 'Is anything created or destroyed?', 'Can you draw the energy flow?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Physical phenomena (shadows, circuits, forces) involve clear causal chains: changing one variable produces a predictable effect, making cause-and-effect reasoning the investigative frame.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

**SC-KS2-D013-CL002:**
- **Cause and Effect** (primary): What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Fair testing and investigations are designed to isolate variables and establish causal relationships — the cognitive demand is reasoning from controlled evidence to causal claims.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Data from repeated investigations reveals patterns that allow pupils to generalise their findings beyond the specific test conditions.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

## Domain: SC-KS2-D014 — Evolution and Inheritance
**Subject:** Science | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** hierarchical

### Curriculum Context
Evolution and Inheritance at upper KS2 introduces pupils to Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection as the scientific explanation for the diversity of life on Earth. Pupils learn that living things have changed over millions of years and that fossils provide evidence of organisms that lived long ago, connecting this to the geological evidence studied in the Rocks domain. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to understand that offspring are not identical to their parents (variation), that some variations are advantageous in a particular environment (natural selection), and that this can lead to evolution over many generations. This domain provides the conceptual framework for understanding inheritance, genetics and biodiversity at KS3.

### Concepts (4)

#### SC-KS2-C063 — Fossils as Evidence of Change Over Time
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that fossils (introduced in Y3 as trapped remains in rock) provide evidence that living things have changed over time and that animals and plants that no longer exist once lived on Earth millions of years ago.

**Teaching guidance:** Revisit fossil knowledge from Year 3 and extend it to the concept of change over time. Compare fossils of extinct organisms with their closest living relatives — for example, ammonites with modern nautilus, trilobites with modern woodlice. Use a geological timeline to show when major groups appeared and disappeared. Discuss what fossils tell us: the types of organisms that existed, the environments they lived in, and how life has changed over millions of years. Link to Darwin's use of fossil evidence in developing his theory of evolution. Examine the concept of extinction — why species disappear and what causes it.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think dinosaurs and humans lived at the same time. Dinosaurs became extinct approximately 66 million years ago; modern humans appeared around 300,000 years ago. Some pupils believe that fossils are only of dinosaurs, not recognising the vast range of fossilised organisms (plants, shells, fish, insects). Children may think that if a species goes extinct, it was somehow 'inferior', rather than understanding that extinction results from environmental change exceeding a species' ability to adapt.

**Key vocabulary:** fossil, evidence, extinct, change, time, millions of years, species, organism, geological, ancient, remains, compare, ancestor, descendant, evolution, palaeontology

#### SC-KS2-C064 — Variation in Offspring
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that living things reproduce offspring of the same kind, but that offspring vary and are not identical to their parents or to each other. This natural variation within species is the raw material for natural selection. Genes/chromosomes not required at this stage.

**Teaching guidance:** Explore variation within the class — measure hand span, height, arm length, eye colour, and discuss why no two people are identical (except identical twins, who share DNA). Compare parents and offspring using photographs: children resemble their parents but are not identical to them. Investigate variation in other organisms — leaf size in a species of tree, shell patterns in snails. Distinguish between inherited variation (eye colour, nose shape) and environmental variation (scars, hairstyle, language). At this stage, genes and chromosomes are not required, but the idea that characteristics are passed from parent to offspring through reproduction should be established.

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think offspring are exact copies of their parents or an exact 50/50 mix. Offspring inherit a combination of characteristics but the expression is complex and not a simple blend. Some pupils confuse inherited characteristics with learned or environmental characteristics — speaking English is environmental, not inherited. Children may believe that individual organisms can change their characteristics during their lifetime and pass these changes to offspring (Lamarckian inheritance), which is incorrect.

**Key vocabulary:** variation, offspring, parent, inherit, characteristic, feature, similar, different, species, reproduce, identical, unique, trait, generation, diversity

#### SC-KS2-C065 — Adaptation
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5 | Fan-out: 1

Understanding that animals and plants have features that help them survive in their particular environment. These adaptations may be structural (camouflage, body shape, insulation) or behavioural. Different environments select for different adaptations.

**Teaching guidance:** Use striking examples of adaptation to engage pupils: polar bear fur (insulation and camouflage), cactus spines (reduced water loss), giraffe neck (reaching high vegetation), woodpecker beak (drilling into wood). Compare organisms from different environments — arctic versus desert, deep sea versus rainforest — and identify how their features help them survive. Challenge pupils to design an imaginary animal adapted to a specific environment, justifying each feature. Investigate examples of camouflage using peppered moth photographs. Distinguish between structural adaptations (physical features) and behavioural adaptations (migration, hibernation, nocturnal activity).

**Common misconceptions:** Children commonly think that individual animals deliberately adapt or choose to develop helpful features in response to their environment (e.g., 'giraffes stretched their necks to reach high leaves'). Adaptation occurs over many generations through natural selection, not within an individual's lifetime. Some pupils think adaptation means animals are perfectly suited to their environment — in reality, organisms are 'good enough' rather than optimal. Children may believe that adaptation is a conscious or intentional process.

**Key vocabulary:** adaptation, adapted, environment, habitat, survive, feature, structural, behavioural, camouflage, predator, prey, competition, advantage, suited, desert, arctic, specialised

#### SC-KS2-C066 — Evolution
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 4 | Teaching weight: 5

Understanding that adaptation may lead to evolution — that over very long periods of time, variation and natural selection can lead to populations becoming better adapted to their environments and to the development of new species. Work of Darwin and Wallace.

**Teaching guidance:** Build from the concepts of variation, inheritance and adaptation to explain evolution by natural selection: organisms vary; those with advantageous variations are more likely to survive and reproduce; their offspring inherit these variations; over many generations, the population changes. Use the peppered moth example (light moths on soot-covered trees during the Industrial Revolution) as a well-documented case study. Discuss Darwin's and Wallace's contributions and the evidence they gathered. Use simulations (e.g., bird beak tools picking up different 'food' types) to model natural selection. Emphasise the timescale — evolution typically occurs over thousands or millions of years, not within a single lifetime.

**Common misconceptions:** The most common misconception is that individual organisms evolve during their lifetime — evolution occurs across populations over many generations. Children may think evolution has a goal or direction ('aiming' towards a perfect form), when it is an undirected process driven by environmental pressures. Some pupils confuse evolution with metamorphosis (a frog changing from tadpole) or with individual growth. Children may think that evolution means species 'improve' over time, rather than understanding that species become better adapted to their current environment.

**Key vocabulary:** evolution, natural selection, variation, adaptation, inherit, generation, species, survival, reproduce, population, change, Darwin, Wallace, evidence, theory, extinction, ancestor

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**SC-KS2-D014-CL001:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Food chains, food webs and ecosystems are system models: pupils map components (producers, consumers, decomposers), trace energy flows, and predict what happens when one part changes.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Stability and Change**: What keeps this stable, what causes change, and how quickly does change happen?
  Why: Ecosystems maintain dynamic equilibria that can be disrupted by changes to one component — exploring what keeps the system stable and what destabilises it is an equally powerful framing.
  AI instruction: Use the STABILITY AND CHANGE lens: prompt pupils to identify what conditions keep a system in balance, what disrupts equilibrium, and how change can be gradual or sudden. Useful questions: 'What keeps this the same?', 'What would tip it into change?', 'Is the change reversible?', 'How fast is this changing, and why?'

**SC-KS2-D014-CL002:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Sorting, classifying and identifying similarities directly trains pupils to recognise regularities and use them to predict or generalise.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Evidence and Argument**: What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Drawing conclusions from observations requires constructing a claim supported by specific evidence — not just describing what was seen.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'

**SC-KS2-D014-CL003:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Food chains, food webs and ecosystems are system models: pupils map components (producers, consumers, decomposers), trace energy flows, and predict what happens when one part changes.

## Domain: HI-KS2-D002 — British History
**Subject:** History | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** knowledge

### Curriculum Context
British history at KS2 covers the sweep of British prehistory and early history from the Stone Age to the Norman period, supplemented by a local history study and a thematic study extending beyond 1066. Each period of British history specified in the curriculum has distinctive content: Stone Age to Iron Age covers prehistoric Britain before written records; Roman Britain examines the impact of a major empire on the British Isles; Anglo-Saxons and Vikings covers the transformative period of migration, conversion and conflict between the fifth and eleventh centuries. Pupils develop understanding of how Britain has been shaped by successive waves of migration, invasion and settlement, and how different peoples have contributed to British identity and culture. The requirement to study a local history and a post-1066 theme gives schools flexibility to connect national history to pupils' own environments and to develop longer-range chronological understanding.

### Concepts (1)

#### HI-KS2-C005 — British Historical Periods: Prehistoric to Medieval
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Britain's history from the Stone Age to the Norman Conquest encompasses several distinct periods, each marked by major social, technological and political changes: Prehistoric Britain (Stone, Bronze and Iron Ages); Roman Britain (43-410 AD); Anglo-Saxon Britain (410-1066 AD); and Viking Age Britain (793-1066 AD). Each period represents a distinct phase in the long history of human habitation and society on the British Isles, with different peoples, technologies, political systems, religious beliefs and cultural practices. Understanding these periods gives pupils a foundation in British heritage and the capacity to recognise the long-range development of the society they live in.

**Teaching guidance:** Establish a clear chronological framework for the periods studied: use a timeline that runs from prehistoric times to 1066 and place each topic on it. Study each period in sufficient depth to understand its distinctive character, not just its sequence. Connect periods: how did the Roman occupation affect the Anglo-Saxon period? What did the Vikings find when they arrived? Use artefacts, reconstructions and archaeological evidence alongside textual sources. Connect to local history: are there local Roman roads, Anglo-Saxon place names, Viking settlements?

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may see the historical periods as completely separate rather than as phases in a continuous story. Emphasising connections between periods - the Roman influence on Anglo-Saxon culture, the Viking influence on English - develops more integrated understanding. Pupils may have a romantic rather than realistic view of the Viking or Anglo-Saxon periods; a balanced approach using archaeological and textual evidence avoids both romanticisation and demonisation.

**Key vocabulary:** prehistoric, Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, Roman, Anglo-Saxon, Viking, Norman, invasion, settlement, tribe, kingdom, conquest, legacy, chronology, period

### ConceptClusters (1)

**HI-KS2-D002-CL001** — Understand British prehistory and medieval history from Stone Age to Norman Conquest [CURATED]
Type: practice
Concepts: HI-KS2-C005 (British Historical Periods: Prehistoric to Medieval)
Rationale: Single concept domain; the sweep from Stone Age to medieval Britain is the major British history content unit at KS2 — pupils trace change and continuity across prehistoric, Iron Age, Roman, Anglo-Saxon and Viking periods, building a chronological framework for later study.
Inspired by: C3 Framework D2.His.2 — classifying historical periods into eras and explaining the criteria used

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**HI-KS2-D002-CL001:**
- **Continuity and Change Over Time** (primary): What has stayed the same, what has changed, and what drove that change?
  Why: The sweep from Stone Age to Norman Conquest is explicitly a study in long-run change and continuity — pupils must trace what shifted (tools, religion, political organisation, language) and what persisted across prehistoric, Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods, building a chronological framework for later study.
  AI instruction: Use the CONTINUITY AND CHANGE OVER TIME lens: prompt pupils to construct timelines, identify turning points, distinguish what changed from what persisted, and explain what drove change. Useful questions: 'What was the same before and after?', 'What was the turning point?', 'Was this a sudden change or a gradual shift?', 'Who or what drove this change?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Each successive wave of change (Roman invasion, Anglo-Saxon migration, Viking raids, Norman Conquest) requires pupils to ask what caused it and what consequences followed, practising causal reasoning at an accessible narrative scale.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

## Domain: HI-KS2-D003 — World History
**Subject:** History | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** knowledge

### Curriculum Context
World history at KS2 gives pupils knowledge and understanding of some of the great civilisations of the ancient world beyond Europe. The curriculum requires study of the earliest civilisations (with choice from Ancient Sumer, Indus Valley, Ancient Egypt, or Shang Dynasty China), Ancient Greece (as a foundational civilisation for Western culture), and a non-European society that offers significant contrast with British history - with examples given as early Islamic civilisation centred on Baghdad around 900 AD, Mayan civilisation around 900 AD, and the kingdom of Benin from around 900 to 1300 AD. These requirements ensure that pupils encounter world history from diverse geographic and cultural perspectives, challenging any narrowly Eurocentric view of significant history. Studying these civilisations also develops pupils' understanding of the long-range development of human society, technology and culture.

### Concepts (1)

#### HI-KS2-C004 — Ancient Civilisations
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

The earliest civilisations - Ancient Sumer, the Indus Valley, Ancient Egypt and the Shang Dynasty of Ancient China - represent the first complex, literate human societies, emerging between approximately 3500 and 1200 BC in different parts of the world. They share characteristic features including writing systems, monumental architecture, complex religious and political hierarchies, specialised crafts and trade networks. Studying these civilisations develops pupils' understanding of how human societies developed from prehistoric hunter-gatherer communities to complex, literate, urban civilisations, and provides global perspective on the origins of human achievement.

**Teaching guidance:** Provide an overview of where and when the earliest civilisations appeared before conducting a depth study of one. Use maps to show that civilisations emerged independently in different parts of the world. Study the key features of the chosen civilisation in depth: its geography, political system, religious beliefs, achievements and daily life. Use artefacts, images of archaeological sites and translations of primary sources where available. Connect to pupils' general chronological framework: how long ago was this civilisation? What was happening in Britain at the same time?

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often think ancient civilisations were primitive or unsophisticated. Studying their technological, artistic and intellectual achievements challenges this. The concept of civilisation can carry value judgements; it is important to discuss what the term means without implying that non-urban societies are inferior. Pupils may not connect ancient civilisations to the present; discussing legacies (alphabet, legal codes, mathematics, architecture) makes the connection explicit.

**Key vocabulary:** civilisation, ancient, Bronze Age, settlement, city-state, pharaoh, hierarchy, irrigation, agriculture, trade, writing, archaeology, artefact, empire, legacy

### ConceptClusters (1)

**HI-KS2-D003-CL001** — Investigate the achievements and legacies of ancient civilisations [CURATED]
Type: practice
Concepts: HI-KS2-C004 (Ancient Civilisations)
Rationale: Single concept domain; ancient civilisations (Egypt, Sumer, Indus Valley, Shang China) are studied as KS2 world history content — pupils examine how early societies organised themselves and what they left behind, developing comparative thinking across cultures.
Inspired by: C3 Framework D2.His.2 — explaining how and why historical periods have been constructed

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**HI-KS2-D003-CL001:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Ancient civilisations are studied as organised societies — pupils examine how early states structured their governance, agriculture, religion and trade as interlocking systems, developing comparative thinking about what makes a civilisation function.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Continuity and Change Over Time**: What has stayed the same, what has changed, and what drove that change?
  Why: Focusing on 'legacies' explicitly asks what from these ancient societies persists into the present (writing systems, legal codes, architectural forms) — a continuity_change frame that gives historical distance meaning for pupils.
  AI instruction: Use the CONTINUITY AND CHANGE OVER TIME lens: prompt pupils to construct timelines, identify turning points, distinguish what changed from what persisted, and explain what drove change. Useful questions: 'What was the same before and after?', 'What was the turning point?', 'Was this a sudden change or a gradual shift?', 'Who or what drove this change?'

## Domain: HI-KS2-D004 — Historical Enquiry and Disciplinary Skills
**Subject:** History | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
At KS2, historical enquiry skills develop in sophistication and rigour. Pupils move beyond basic source use to more analytical engagement with historical evidence, beginning to question sources' reliability, purpose and perspective, and understanding that different historians can interpret the same evidence differently. The conceptual vocabulary of the discipline - cause, consequence, significance, change, continuity, similarity, difference, evidence, interpretation - gives pupils the intellectual tools to think about history as a discipline rather than merely a body of facts. Constructing informed responses to historical questions, and communicating those responses clearly in writing and discussion, develops pupils as active historical thinkers rather than passive recipients of historical narratives.

### Concepts (3)

#### HI-KS2-C001 — Cause and Consequence
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 2

Historical causation involves understanding why events happened - identifying the factors that made an event or change more or less likely, and explaining how those factors combined to produce historical outcomes. Consequence refers to the effects of events or changes - what happened as a result, both immediately and over longer periods. At KS2, pupils develop the ability to identify multiple causes and consequences for historical events, understanding that history is driven by the complex interaction of political, economic, social, religious and individual factors rather than single causes.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach cause and consequence explicitly as analytical concepts, not just as narrative. Use 'because' and 'therefore' to structure causal arguments. Give pupils a range of possible causes and ask them to rank or categorise them. Distinguish between long-term and immediate causes. Explore unintended consequences: what happened that was not planned or predicted? Use historical examples from the periods studied to build up a bank of causal arguments. Help pupils express causal relationships in written historical argument.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often identify single causes for complex historical events, when in reality multiple factors interact. Teaching that causes can be categorised (political, economic, social) and that they interact helps. Pupils may confuse correlation with causation; discussing examples where two things happened at the same time but were not causally related develops more precise thinking. The idea of unintended consequences can be surprising; good historical examples make it concrete.

**Key vocabulary:** cause, consequence, effect, result, factor, reason, led to, because, therefore, impact, outcome, trigger, long-term, short-term, significant, unintended

#### HI-KS2-C002 — Significance
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Historical significance refers to the importance of a person, event or development in history, assessed by criteria such as the scale and duration of its impact, how many people were affected, whether it changed the course of events, whether people at the time thought it important, and how it is remembered and commemorated. Significance is not fixed: what seems significant from one perspective or in one time period may appear less so from another. At KS2, pupils begin to develop explicit criteria for judging historical significance and apply them to the people and events they study.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach explicit criteria for significance: notable (was it important at the time?), remembered (is it still remembered?), resonant (do people connect with it?), resulting (did it have consequences?), remarkable (was it unusual?). Apply these criteria to historical examples. Discuss how significance can change over time - a battle that seemed decisive at the time may look less important with hindsight. Explore why some historical figures and events are remembered while others are forgotten, connecting to discussions of power and representation.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often conflate significance with fame, assuming that well-known figures must be the most significant. Discussing overlooked historical figures who had major impacts challenges this. The idea that significance is judged rather than simply recognised can be counterintuitive; explicit discussion of the criteria for significance helps. Pupils may not realise that significance can be contested - different people may disagree about how significant an event was.

**Key vocabulary:** significance, important, memorable, lasting, impact, remember, commemorate, notable, evaluate, judge, criteria, perspective, evidence, why

#### HI-KS2-C003 — Historical Evidence and Interpretation
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 2

Historians construct interpretations of the past from the evidence that survives. Evidence includes primary sources (created at the time) and secondary sources (created after the fact), each with distinctive strengths and limitations. Historians also interpret the same evidence differently based on their questions, frameworks and perspectives, which is why different historical accounts of the same events can reach different conclusions. At KS2, pupils develop the ability to work with and evaluate a range of historical sources, and to understand that historical knowledge is constructed through the interpretation of evidence rather than simply discovered.

**Teaching guidance:** Develop a systematic approach to source analysis: provenance (who, when, why), content (what does it say/show), utility (what can we learn from it) and reliability (how trustworthy is it and why). Compare sources that offer different perspectives on the same event. Discuss why sources can be biased or incomplete without being worthless. Help pupils understand that all historical accounts, including their textbooks, are interpretations. Use 'big question' enquiries that require pupils to evaluate evidence and construct argued responses.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may believe that written sources are more reliable than other types. Discussing how photographs can be staged, letters can be biased and accounts can be selective challenges this. The concept that a biased source is not necessarily useless requires explicit teaching: a source biased in a particular direction still tells us something about its author's perspective. Pupils may not understand why different historians reach different conclusions; discussing different perspectives and frameworks helps.

**Key vocabulary:** source, evidence, primary, secondary, provenance, reliable, biased, perspective, interpretation, evaluate, corroborate, account, historian, partial, incomplete

### ConceptClusters (2)

**HI-KS2-D004-CL001** — Analyse causes, consequences and the significance of historical events [CURATED]
Type: introduction
Concepts: HI-KS2-C001 (Cause and Consequence), HI-KS2-C002 (Significance)
Rationale: Cause and consequence (C001) and significance (C002) are linked by co-teach hints — pupils learning to explain why events happened naturally move to evaluating which causes and consequences were most important (significance). These second-order concepts are typically introduced together through a shared historical enquiry question.
Inspired by: C3 Framework D2.His.3 — explaining why individuals and groups held particular perspectives during historical periods

**HI-KS2-D004-CL002** — Evaluate historical evidence and construct interpretations of the past [CURATED]
Type: practice
Sequenced after: HI-KS2-D004-CL001
Concepts: HI-KS2-C003 (Historical Evidence and Interpretation)
Rationale: Historical evidence and interpretation (C003) builds on the causal thinking in cluster 1 — once pupils understand why events happened, they apply source skills to assess how reliably we know what happened, evaluating the range and limitations of surviving evidence.
Inspired by: C3 Framework D2.His.9 — comparing information provided by different historical sources about the past

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**HI-KS2-D004-CL001:**
- **Cause and Effect** (primary): What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: This cluster introduces the second-order concept of causation directly — pupils learn to identify multiple causes, organise them into categories, and trace short and long-term consequences, which is the defining cognitive demand of causal-chain historical reasoning.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'
- **Evidence and Argument**: What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Evaluating significance requires pupils to construct and justify a ranked argument about which causes or consequences matter most, using evidence to support their judgement — the move from description to evidenced evaluation is the key disciplinary step introduced here.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'

**HI-KS2-D004-CL002:**
- **Perspective and Interpretation** (primary): Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?
  Why: Evaluating the range and limitations of surviving evidence requires pupils to ask who created each source, from what standpoint, and for what purpose — making interpretation of perspective the central cognitive challenge rather than mere information retrieval.
  AI instruction: Use the PERSPECTIVE AND INTERPRETATION lens: prompt pupils to identify the author's or actor's viewpoint, consider what information or experience shapes that perspective, look for omissions or contradictions, and compare multiple accounts. Useful questions: 'Who wrote/said this, and why?', 'What might they have left out?', 'How would someone else see this differently?', 'What would change your view?'
- **Evidence and Argument**: What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Assessing how reliably we know what happened demands that pupils distinguish between inference and assertion, weigh the evidential value of different source types, and construct arguments about what the available evidence does and does not support.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'

### Objectives (3)
- HI-KS2-O010 [statutory]: pupils should be taught to ask and answer historically valid questions, choosing and using parts of stories and other sources to show that they know and understand key features of events
- HI-KS2-O011 [statutory]: pupils should construct informed responses that involve thoughtful selection and organisation of relevant historical information
- HI-KS2-O012 [statutory]: pupils should address and sometimes devise historically valid questions about change, cause, similarity and difference, and significance

## Domain: GE-KS2-D001 — Locational Knowledge
**Subject:** Geography | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** knowledge

### Curriculum Context
At KS2, locational knowledge expands from the foundational continent and ocean framework of KS1 to more precise spatial knowledge. Pupils locate countries across Europe and the Americas, and develop understanding of the coordinate system of longitude and latitude that allows any point on Earth to be precisely located. The study of UK counties, cities and regions develops pupils' detailed knowledge of their own country. The addition of key lines of latitude (Equator, Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, Arctic and Antarctic Circles) and the Prime Meridian provides pupils with the geographic grid that scientists, navigators and geographers use to describe global location, connecting geography to science and mathematics. Time zones introduce the concept that place on Earth directly affects lived experience through the timing of day and night.

### Concepts (1)

#### GE-KS2-C001 — Latitude, Longitude and the Global Grid **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 3

Latitude and longitude are a coordinate system used to identify any location on Earth's surface. Lines of latitude run parallel to the Equator and measure distance north or south (0-90 degrees); lines of longitude run from Pole to Pole and measure distance east or west of the Prime Meridian (0-180 degrees). Special lines of latitude - the Equator, Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, and the Arctic and Antarctic Circles - mark significant climatic boundaries. The Prime Meridian (0 degrees longitude) divides the Eastern and Western Hemispheres and is the reference for time zones. At KS2, pupils learn to use this system to locate and describe global position.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach latitude and longitude together as a coordinate system, drawing parallels with grid references on UK maps. Use a globe with clearly marked latitude and longitude lines. Explain the significance of the key lines: the Equator (maximum solar heating), the Tropics (limits of overhead sun), the Arctic/Antarctic Circles (limits of midnight sun). Connect to time zones by showing how 15 degrees of longitude equals one hour of time difference. Use digital mapping tools to give coordinates for familiar places.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils frequently confuse latitude (horizontal lines, measuring north-south) with longitude (vertical lines, measuring east-west). A consistent mnemonic (latitude = flat/horizontal) helps. The fact that the Equator is 0 degrees latitude while the Poles are 90 degrees is sometimes reversed; connecting 0 degrees to 'no tilt' and 90 degrees to 'maximum distance from equator' helps. Pupils may not understand why time zones exist; connecting them to the Earth's rotation and the 24-hour day makes the concept concrete.

**Key vocabulary:** latitude, longitude, Equator, hemisphere, tropic, Arctic, Antarctic, Prime Meridian, coordinate, degree, north, south, east, west, time zone, parallel, meridian

### ConceptClusters (1)

**GE-KS2-D001-CL001** — Use latitude, longitude and the global grid to locate places [CURATED] [KEYSTONE]
Type: practice
Concepts: GE-KS2-C001 (Latitude, Longitude and the Global Grid)
Rationale: Single concept domain; latitude and longitude is the defining KS2 locational knowledge skill — pupils build on KS1 atlas use to work with coordinate systems and understand climate patterns linked to latitude.
Inspired by: C3 Framework D2.Geo.1 — using geographic representations including grid coordinates

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**GE-KS2-D001-CL001:**
- **Scale, Proportion and Quantity** (primary): How big, how many, or how much — and how does that change how we think about it?
  Why: Latitude and longitude are quantitative coordinate systems; the cognitive demand is understanding how degrees of arc translate to position on a sphere and why latitude predicts climate — reasoning about proportion and quantity in a spatial context.
  AI instruction: Use the SCALE, PROPORTION AND QUANTITY lens: prompt pupils to compare quantities using ratios and percentages, consider what changes when scale changes, and choose appropriate units of measurement. Useful questions: 'How many times bigger?', 'What fraction of the whole?', 'What changes when we zoom in/out?', 'Which units fit best here?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Linking latitude bands to climate zones introduces the idea that global climate patterns are not random but follow predictable spatial regularities tied to distance from the equator and angle of incoming solar radiation.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

### Objectives (3)
- GE-KS2-O001 [statutory]: locate the world's countries, using maps to focus on Europe (including the location of Russia) and North and South America, concentrating on their environmental regions, key physical and human characteristics, countries, and major cities

## Domain: GE-KS2-D002 — Place Knowledge
**Subject:** Geography | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** knowledge

### Curriculum Context
Place knowledge at KS2 requires the in-depth study of three distinct regions at different scales and in different parts of the world: a UK region, a European region, and a region in North or South America. Each region study develops pupils' ability to describe, explain and compare the human and physical characteristics of a place, considering how physical geography shapes human activity and how human activity transforms physical landscapes. The comparison of regions from different continents ensures that pupils encounter genuinely diverse human geographies, challenging assumptions based on their own experience and developing the broader perspectives that characterise geographical understanding. These region studies also develop pupils' knowledge of specific places, giving them concrete geographical reference points that support broader spatial learning.

### Concepts (1)

#### GE-KS2-C006 — Regional Place Study and Cross-Continental Comparison
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Place study at a regional scale involves developing in-depth understanding of a geographical region: its physical landscape, climate, vegetation, resources, settlement patterns, economic activity and cultural character. At KS2, pupils study three contrasting regions — a UK region, a European region, and a region within North or South America — comparing their human and physical characteristics across continental contexts. Understanding regions in depth, and comparing across continents, develops the geographical knowledge base and the comparative analytical skills that underpin sophisticated geographical thinking. The cross-continental frame ensures that pupils encounter genuinely diverse human geographies, building awareness of how physical geography (climate, relief, resources) shapes human activity in different parts of the world.

**Teaching guidance:** Choose regions that offer genuine contrast: a mountainous Alpine region in Europe compared with a UK lowland region; an Amazonian region compared with a Caribbean island. Structure each regional study using a consistent inquiry framework: location (where is it?), physical geography (what is the landscape and climate like?), human geography (how do people live and work?), change (how is the region changing?), comparison (how does it compare to the other regions studied?). Use maps, photographs, satellite images, statistical data and firsthand accounts. Avoid reducing regions to stereotypes; show their internal diversity and dynamism. Return to the regions studied across the primary years rather than treating each as a one-off topic.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may treat regional studies as discrete topics rather than as recurring reference points for geographical comparison. Returning to studied regions in different thematic contexts (rivers, climate, development) builds richer knowledge than treating each as a one-off study. Pupils may characterise regions by only one or two features, missing the complexity and internal diversity of real regions. Requiring pupils to update their knowledge of studied regions over time prevents oversimplification.

**Key vocabulary:** region, continent, country, European, Americas, compare, physical geography, human geography, characteristic, settlement, economic activity, climate, landscape, cultural, similarities, differences

### External Prerequisites (from other domains)

### ConceptClusters (1)

**GE-KS2-D002-CL001** — Compare a region of the UK with a region in Europe or the Americas [CURATED]
Type: practice
Concepts: GE-KS2-C006 (Regional Place Study and Cross-Continental Comparison)
Rationale: Single concept domain; regional place study expands KS1 locality comparison to a larger geographical scale — pupils use the full range of geographical enquiry tools to compare human and physical characteristics across continents.
Inspired by: C3 Framework D2.Geo.5 — explaining how cultural and environmental characteristics differ between places

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**GE-KS2-D002-CL001:**
- **Scale, Proportion and Quantity** (primary): How big, how many, or how much — and how does that change how we think about it?
  Why: Expanding from KS1 locality comparison to regional scale requires pupils to reason about how comparisons change when the unit of analysis grows — what similarities and differences are meaningful at regional rather than local scale.
  AI instruction: Use the SCALE, PROPORTION AND QUANTITY lens: prompt pupils to compare quantities using ratios and percentages, consider what changes when scale changes, and choose appropriate units of measurement. Useful questions: 'How many times bigger?', 'What fraction of the whole?', 'What changes when we zoom in/out?', 'Which units fit best here?'
- **Systems and System Models**: What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Applying the full range of geographical enquiry tools to understand a region means treating that region as a system where physical and human factors interact — climate influences economy, topography shapes settlement, which in turn affects culture.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'

### Objectives (1)
- GE-KS2-O004 [statutory]: understand geographical similarities and differences through the study of human and physical geography of a region of the United Kingdom, a region in a European country, and a region within North or South America

## Domain: GE-KS2-D003 — Human and Physical Geography
**Subject:** Geography | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** knowledge

### Curriculum Context
The scope of physical and human geography content expands substantially at KS2, moving from descriptive knowledge of features to explanatory understanding of processes. In physical geography, pupils learn about the major climate zones and biomes of the world, the geomorphological processes that shape rivers, mountains, coasts and volcanoes, and the hydrological cycle that connects land, sea and atmosphere. In human geography, pupils understand how settlements grow, how different types of economic activity are distributed, and how trade and natural resources shape human geography at global scales. This shift from description to explanation marks the most significant progression in geographical thinking at KS2, as pupils learn not just what the world looks like but why it is as it is.

### Concepts (3)

#### GE-KS2-C002 — Climate Zones and Biomes
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Climate zones are large areas of the Earth characterised by similar patterns of temperature and rainfall, determined primarily by latitude. The main climate zones are tropical, subtropical, temperate, continental, polar and mountainous. Biomes are large ecological communities defined by their climate and vegetation: rainforest, savannah, desert, grassland, deciduous forest, coniferous forest, tundra and polar ice. At KS2, pupils develop understanding of how climate shapes the vegetation and wildlife of different regions, connecting physical and biological geography.

**Teaching guidance:** Use world climate and biome maps to show the distribution of different zones. Connect climate zones to latitude using the global grid: equatorial regions are typically tropical, polar regions are cold. Study specific biomes in depth: what are the characteristics, adaptations of plants and animals, human uses? Explore how climate change is altering biome boundaries. Compare a UK biome (temperate deciduous forest) with a contrasting global biome (tropical rainforest or desert). Connect to human geography by exploring how people adapt to different climate zones.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may confuse climate zone with biome; clarifying that climate determines what biome can exist in an area resolves this. Pupils may think deserts are always hot; cold deserts (Gobi, Antarctica) challenge this assumption. The idea that tropical regions are always wet is also inaccurate; tropical wet and dry seasons should be distinguished. Pupils may underestimate how dramatically human activity has altered natural biomes; discussing deforestation and agriculture develops critical awareness.

**Key vocabulary:** climate zone, biome, tropical, temperate, polar, arctic, desert, rainforest, savannah, tundra, vegetation belt, adaptation, precipitation, temperature, ecosystem

#### GE-KS2-C003 — River Systems and the Water Cycle
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

A river system comprises a river and all its tributaries, flowing through a drainage basin from source to mouth. Rivers shape the landscape through the processes of erosion, transportation and deposition, creating characteristic landforms including valleys, meanders, ox-bow lakes, deltas and floodplains. The water cycle describes the continuous movement of water between ocean, atmosphere, land and rivers through processes of evaporation, condensation, precipitation, run-off and infiltration. At KS2, pupils develop understanding of both river processes and the wider hydrological cycle that sustains freshwater systems.

**Teaching guidance:** Use diagrams and models to explain the water cycle, connecting the processes to observable phenomena (clouds, rain, rivers, evaporation). Study a specific river system in detail: trace it from source to mouth on a map, identify key tributaries and settlements, study the features at different stages. Use photographs to study river landforms at different locations. Connect rivers to human activity: water supply, settlements, trade, flooding. Investigate local rivers or streams through fieldwork.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often think rivers flow uphill at some point; careful explanation of how gravity determines flow direction addresses this. The water cycle is often presented too simplistically; exploring the variety of pathways water can take (groundwater, evapotranspiration, run-off) develops more accurate understanding. Pupils may not connect rivers to the water cycle; linking the discussion of river flow to rainfall and precipitation makes the connection explicit.

**Key vocabulary:** river, source, mouth, tributary, drainage basin, meander, flood plain, erosion, deposition, transportation, water cycle, evaporation, condensation, precipitation, run-off, infiltration

#### GE-KS2-C004 — Settlement and Economic Geography
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Settlements are places where people live and work, ranging from small hamlets to megacities. Their location, growth and character are shaped by physical factors (water supply, defensibility, flat land, resources) and human factors (trade routes, industry, government decisions). Economic activity is classified into sectors: primary (extracting raw materials), secondary (manufacturing), tertiary (services) and quaternary (knowledge-based). The distribution of natural resources including food, minerals, energy and water shapes economic activity and trade between places at global scales. At KS2, pupils develop conceptual frameworks for understanding why places are where they are and how economies work.

**Teaching guidance:** Study local settlement history: why was the town/city located here? What factors drove its growth? Compare settlement patterns in different environments: how do desert settlements differ from coastal or riverside ones? Use examples of global trade to illustrate economic interdependence. Investigate the origin of food and goods in the classroom or school. Map the distribution of specific natural resources (oil, minerals, food production) and connect to trade patterns. Explore how economic activity changes over time in a specific area.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may think cities grow randomly rather than for geographical reasons. Studying the historical reasons for settlement location challenges this. The concept of comparative advantage in trade can be difficult; concrete examples of why one place might specialise in particular goods make it accessible. Pupils may not appreciate the scale of global economic interdependence; tracking the journey of a familiar product from raw material to consumer makes global connections tangible.

**Key vocabulary:** settlement, hamlet, village, town, city, conurbation, urbanisation, primary sector, secondary sector, tertiary sector, trade, import, export, natural resource, energy, mineral, distribution

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**GE-KS2-D003-CL001:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: The water cycle is an archetypal system — evaporation, condensation, precipitation and run-off are interconnected processes where a change at one point affects all others; the biome concept similarly treats climate, soils, plants and animals as a functioning ecological system.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Climate zones and biomes are distributed across the globe in recognisable spatial patterns tied to latitude, altitude and ocean currents — recognising these patterns and explaining why they exist is the core cognitive task of this cluster.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**GE-KS2-D003-CL002:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Settlement and economic geography asks pupils to identify why settlements grew where they did — near rivers, transport routes, resources — which is fundamentally about recognising spatial patterns and explaining what determines them.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Understanding how physical factors (river crossing, flat land, natural harbour) caused settlements to grow, and how economic activities in turn shaped the settlement's form and function, requires explicit cause-and-effect reasoning across physical and human geography.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

## Domain: GE-KS2-D004 — Geographical Skills and Fieldwork
**Subject:** Geography | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
Geographical skills at KS2 develop substantially in precision and range. Pupils extend their use of compass directions from four to eight points; they learn to use grid references to locate specific points on Ordnance Survey maps with increasing precision; and they develop the ability to interpret the conventional symbols and topographic information on standard UK maps. Digital and computer mapping tools introduce pupils to GIS (geographical information systems) and satellite mapping as contemporary geographical technologies. Fieldwork at KS2 extends beyond the school grounds to include the wider local environment, incorporating the collection of primary data through observation, sketch maps, plans, graphs and digital technologies. These skills equip pupils to conduct genuine geographical enquiry, asking questions about the world and gathering evidence to answer them.

### Concepts (1)

#### GE-KS2-C005 — Ordnance Survey Maps and Grid References
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Ordnance Survey (OS) maps are detailed topographic maps of Great Britain produced to standard conventions, using a national grid reference system, contour lines to represent relief, and a comprehensive set of conventional symbols. Four-figure grid references identify a 1km grid square; six-figure grid references identify a 100m square within that. The OS map is the primary tool for geographical fieldwork and navigation in the UK context, and the skills required to use it effectively - reading symbols, using grid references, interpreting contours - are core geographical competencies at KS2.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach grid references systematically: 'along the corridor and up the stairs' as a mnemonic for reading eastings before northings. Practice with familiar local OS maps before unfamiliar ones. Teach contour interpretation by connecting the map to photographs and the real landscape. Build proficiency progressively: four-figure references before six-figure. Use the OS map symbol key and test recognition of common symbols. Plan routes using OS maps, calculating distances using scale. Combine with fieldwork by using OS maps in the local area.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils consistently confuse the order of grid references, giving northings before eastings. The 'along the corridor and up the stairs' mnemonic helps, but consistent practice is essential. Contour interpretation is challenging; many pupils cannot readily visualise three-dimensional relief from two-dimensional contour lines. Building up from simple cross-sections and physical models helps. Pupils may not understand that the scale bar means different things at different zoom levels.

**Key vocabulary:** Ordnance Survey, grid reference, easting, northing, contour, elevation, symbol, key, scale, relief, topographic, national grid, four-figure, six-figure, spot height

Type: practice
Concepts: GE-KS2-C005 (Ordnance Survey Maps and Grid References)
Rationale: Single concept domain; OS maps and grid references represent the core KS2 cartographic skill — pupils move from general atlas use to the specialist detail of topographic maps, interpreting contours, symbols and four/six-figure grid references.
Inspired by: C3 Framework D2.Geo.1 — constructing and interpreting geographic representations

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**GE-KS2-D004-CL001:**
- **Evidence and Argument** (primary): What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Interpreting OS map symbols, contours and grid references to describe or navigate a landscape requires treating the map as evidential data and making reasoned spatial arguments about what the landscape must look like based on that evidence.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'
- **Scale, Proportion and Quantity**: How big, how many, or how much — and how does that change how we think about it?
  Why: Understanding map scale, contour intervals and six-figure grid references involves proportional reasoning — translating distances and heights from map to reality and back — which is the quantitative core of this cluster's cognitive demand.
  AI instruction: Use the SCALE, PROPORTION AND QUANTITY lens: prompt pupils to compare quantities using ratios and percentages, consider what changes when scale changes, and choose appropriate units of measurement. Useful questions: 'How many times bigger?', 'What fraction of the whole?', 'What changes when we zoom in/out?', 'Which units fit best here?'

## Domain: AD-KS2-D001 — Developing Techniques and Mastery
**Subject:** Art and Design | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
At KS2, pupils build upon the exploratory work of KS1 to develop greater technical mastery and intentional control of materials and processes. The curriculum specifies improvement in drawing, painting and sculpture across a range of materials including pencil, charcoal, paint and clay, with pupils expected to work with creativity, experimentation and an increasing awareness of different kinds of art, craft and design. This domain is central to the KS2 curriculum because it shifts pupils from exploration to craft, developing the understanding that mastery requires deliberate practice and critical self-evaluation. Pupils begin to make conscious choices about which techniques and materials serve their creative intentions, rather than simply trying things out.

### Concepts (4)

#### AD-KS2-C001 — Drawing Mastery
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 2

At KS2, drawing develops from exploratory mark-making to more controlled, purposeful and technically sophisticated work. Pupils learn to use a wider range of drawing tools and to vary line quality, tone and mark-making techniques to achieve different effects, including observational drawing and drawing from imagination. The concept of mastery implies deliberate practice, critical self-evaluation and progressive improvement over time.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce pencil grading (H to B) and demonstrate how different pressures and angles create different marks. Teach shading techniques including hatching, cross-hatching and blending. Set regular observational drawing tasks from natural objects, still life and the environment. Use charcoal for tonal work and bold expressive drawing. Encourage pupils to compare drawings over time and identify areas of improvement. Connect drawing to sketchbook practice as a way of developing ideas.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may equate drawing mastery with photographic accuracy rather than expressive control. Teaching that great artists develop personal styles reinforces that mastery is about intentional choices. Some pupils give up if their first attempt does not match expectation; scaffolding with structured practice builds resilience and the understanding that skill is developed over time.

**Key vocabulary:** tone, shade, gradient, hatching, cross-hatching, contour, proportion, perspective, observation, detail, composition, charcoal, graphite, tonal range

#### AD-KS2-C002 — Painting Mastery
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Building on KS1 colour exploration, KS2 pupils develop greater control in mixing, applying and layering paint to achieve specific expressive and representational effects. They learn about colour theory including complementary and harmonious colours, warm and cool palettes, and how artists use colour deliberately to create mood, depth and compositional focus.

**Teaching guidance:** Explore a wider range of paints including watercolour, acrylic and poster paint. Teach colour mixing in more depth, covering warm and cool colours, complementary pairs, and how to create neutrals and earthy tones. Study how artists such as Monet, Van Gogh or Klimt used colour expressively. Teach techniques such as wet-on-wet watercolour, impasto and glazing. Encourage pupils to plan colour choices in sketchbooks before committing to final paintings.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may believe colour mixing is unpredictable. Systematic colour mixing activities build understanding of predictable outcomes. Some pupils mix too many colours resulting in muddy browns; teaching about complementary pairs and limited palettes addresses this. Pupils may not connect colour choices to emotional or compositional intent.

**Key vocabulary:** complementary, harmonious, warm, cool, tint, shade, hue, intensity, wet-on-wet, impasto, glaze, wash, palette, saturated, neutral

#### AD-KS2-C003 — Sculpture Mastery
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

At KS2, pupils develop greater technical control and creative ambition in three-dimensional work. They learn to use materials such as clay, wire, card and found objects with increasing skill, understanding how structural decisions affect the stability, form and visual impact of a sculpture. Pupils also develop awareness of how sculptors work across a range of traditions and purposes.

**Teaching guidance:** Build on KS1 clay work with more complex techniques such as coil building, slab construction and surface decoration. Use wire armatures to support larger-scale figures or abstract forms. Explore mixed-media sculpture combining multiple materials. Study a range of sculptors from different cultures and periods. Encourage pupils to plan three-dimensional work through sketches and maquettes before making final pieces.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may focus on surface decoration at the expense of structural integrity. Teaching basic structural principles prevents this. Some pupils may not see sculpture as a legitimate mode of artistic expression compared to drawing and painting; a rich diet of sculptural examples challenges this. Planning in 2D before working in 3D is a skill that requires explicit modelling.

**Key vocabulary:** sculpture, three-dimensional, relief, armature, coil, slab, pinch, carve, assemble, texture, form, space, maquette, installation

#### AD-KS2-C006 — Creativity and Experimentation
Type: process | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Creativity in art and design involves generating original ideas, making unexpected connections and being willing to experiment beyond familiar approaches. The KS2 curriculum explicitly requires pupils to approach their art making with creativity and experimentation, developing an increasing awareness of different kinds of art, craft and design. This concept involves taking creative risks, exploring different possibilities and developing a personal artistic voice.

**Teaching guidance:** Set open-ended creative briefs that allow diverse responses. Reward risk-taking and unusual approaches. Use warm-up activities that free pupils from concern about outcomes. Teach techniques for generating ideas such as mind-mapping, collage, random juxtapositions and working from imagination as well as observation. Discuss how famous artists experimented throughout their careers and how their work evolved.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may equate creativity with natural talent and believe it cannot be developed. Teaching that creativity involves learnable strategies and habits of mind addresses this. Some pupils may need explicit permission to make unusual choices or to depart from conventional approaches. Evaluation of creative risk-taking should reward the process of exploration, not only the quality of final outcomes.

**Key vocabulary:** experiment, explore, original, creative, invent, imagination, risk, develop, combine, transform, investigate, unconventional, personal style

Creativity and Experimentation is a cross-cutting process concept best embedded within active making contexts rather than taught alone.
Inspired by: UK NC Art and Design KS2 mastery + creativity emphasis

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**AD-KS2-D001-CL001:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Mastery of drawing and painting requires understanding how specific material properties (pencil hardness, paint viscosity, brush type) determine the marks that can be made — structure directly constrains and enables expressive function.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Tonal control and deliberate mark-making involve identifying and reproducing graduated visual patterns; progressive skill development is itself a pattern of refinement across repeated practice episodes.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**AD-KS2-D001-CL002:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Sculpture requires understanding how three-dimensional materials behave structurally — how form can be built, carved or modelled — and creative experimentation tests those structural limits to discover new expressive possibilities.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Experimentation across media involves noticing repeating surface patterns, textures and formal relationships that emerge across different sculptural approaches and materials.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

### Objectives (1)
- AD-KS2-O002 [statutory]: to improve their mastery of art and design techniques, including drawing, painting and sculpture with a range of materials [for example, pencil, charcoal, paint, clay]

## Domain: AD-KS2-D002 — Sketchbooks and Observational Practice
**Subject:** Art and Design | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
Sketchbooks are introduced at KS2 as a key tool for artistic development, mirroring the working practice of professional artists and designers. They provide a space for pupils to record observations of the world around them, experiment with techniques and materials, collect visual research and develop ideas before committing to a final outcome. The educational rationale is that sketchbooks make visible the iterative, exploratory nature of creativity and teach pupils that effective making involves planning, revision and reflection rather than a single attempt. Pupils learn to see their sketchbook as a resource to return to, building habits of visual curiosity and careful looking that serve them throughout their artistic education.

### Concepts (1)

#### AD-KS2-C004 — Sketchbook as Creative Tool
Type: process | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 2

A sketchbook is a personal working document used by artists to record observations, collect ideas, experiment with techniques and develop thinking over time. At KS2, pupils learn to use sketchbooks as an integral part of their creative process, treating them as a living record of their developing ideas rather than a place for finished work. This concept models the iterative, exploratory nature of creative practice.

**Teaching guidance:** Give each pupil their own sketchbook and establish a culture where it is used regularly throughout the year. Encourage pupils to fill pages with quick sketches, notes, material samples and test marks as well as more developed studies. Set specific sketchbook tasks such as observational drawings, colour experiments and responses to works of art. Teach pupils to annotate their sketchbooks with reflections. Treat sketchbooks as evidence of creative thinking and reward exploration rather than only finished quality.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often treat sketchbooks as finished work books, producing neat drawings on blank pages. The idea that messy, exploratory work is valuable needs explicit modelling by teachers. Some pupils may not see the connection between sketchbook work and final outcomes; structured links between exploration and making phases are essential.

**AD-KS2-D002-CL001:**
- **Evidence and Argument** (primary): What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: The sketchbook functions as a record of visual evidence — observations, experiments, annotations — from which ideas are developed and justified; pupils learn to use their own recorded evidence to make and support creative decisions.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'
- **Structure and Function**: How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Understanding the sketchbook as a structured working document (not just a notebook) requires grasping how different types of recording — thumbnail sketches, colour tests, annotations — each serve a distinct function in the creative process.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'

## Domain: AD-KS2-D003 — Art History: Great Artists, Architects and Designers
**Subject:** Art and Design | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** knowledge

### Curriculum Context
This domain extends pupils' cultural and historical knowledge of art and design by focusing on significant practitioners across history, with explicit inclusion of architects and designers as well as artists. Pupils learn that great works of art and design are located within historical periods and social contexts, and that practitioners have been influenced by the world around them and by each other's innovations. KS2 pupils are expected to make active connections between historical examples and their own creative work, using the work of great practitioners as inspiration, reference and a source of critical dialogue. This domain builds the disciplinary knowledge that enables pupils to engage meaningfully with art history and cultural heritage, and to situate their own creative work within a broader tradition.

### Concepts (1)

#### AD-KS2-C005 — Art History: Artists, Architects and Designers
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Great artists, architects and designers throughout history have developed distinctive styles and approaches that reflect the social, cultural and historical contexts of their time. At KS2, pupils learn to place significant practitioners within historical periods and begin to understand how their work has shaped art history and influenced subsequent practitioners. The explicit inclusion of architects and designers broadens pupils' understanding beyond fine art.

**Teaching guidance:** Study a diverse selection of artists, architects and designers across different historical periods, cultures and disciplines. Include both canonical and less well-known examples, and deliberately include non-Western and contemporary practitioners. Use high-quality reproductions and, where possible, visits to galleries and museums. Set projects that use specific practitioners as starting points. Teach pupils to describe, interpret and evaluate works of art using appropriate language drawn from the formal elements.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may see art history as a list of names and dates. Connecting historical examples to pupils' own work and to contemporary practice makes history meaningful. Pupils may not appreciate non-Western art traditions; deliberately including diverse examples challenges Eurocentric assumptions. The division between fine art, craft and design can create a false hierarchy that needs to be questioned.

**Key vocabulary:** Renaissance, Impressionism, Modernism, movement, period, style, influence, tradition, architect, designer, sculptor, painter, historical context, cultural context

Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**AD-KS2-D003-CL001:**
- **Perspective and Interpretation** (primary): Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?
  Why: Studying significant practitioners requires pupils to understand works from within the artist's historical context and intention, not just react aesthetically — making interpretive stance the core cognitive demand.
  AI instruction: Use the PERSPECTIVE AND INTERPRETATION lens: prompt pupils to identify the author's or actor's viewpoint, consider what information or experience shapes that perspective, look for omissions or contradictions, and compare multiple accounts. Useful questions: 'Who wrote/said this, and why?', 'What might they have left out?', 'How would someone else see this differently?', 'What would change your view?'
- **Continuity and Change Over Time**: What has stayed the same, what has changed, and what drove that change?
  Why: Studying great artists and designers 'throughout history' explicitly positions art knowledge as a chronological narrative where styles, techniques and ideas develop, persist or break with precedent across time.
  AI instruction: Use the CONTINUITY AND CHANGE OVER TIME lens: prompt pupils to construct timelines, identify turning points, distinguish what changed from what persisted, and explain what drove change. Useful questions: 'What was the same before and after?', 'What was the turning point?', 'Was this a sudden change or a gradual shift?', 'Who or what drove this change?'

## Domain: MU-KS2-D001 — Performing in Solo and Ensemble Contexts
**Subject:** Music | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
At KS2, performance develops significantly in sophistication. Pupils perform both as soloists and in ensembles, and the curriculum specifies increasing accuracy, fluency, control and expression as the goals of this development. These four qualities mark the progression from competent playing to genuinely musical performance: accuracy concerns correctness of pitch and rhythm; fluency concerns smoothness and ease of delivery; control concerns management of the technical demands; and expression concerns communicating musical meaning and emotion. Pupils should have the opportunity to learn a musical instrument, and classroom ensembles provide the social and musical experience of playing with others, developing listening, coordination and responsibility for one's musical contribution.

### Concepts (1)

#### MU-KS2-C001 — Ensemble Performance Skills
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Ensemble performance requires musicians to listen to and coordinate with others while maintaining their own part, developing skills of listening, timing, balance and musical communication. At KS2, pupils develop the ability to play in groups, adjust their contribution to the ensemble, follow a conductor and manage the social and musical demands of collaborative music making.

**Teaching guidance:** Create regular ensemble opportunities in whole-class instrumental lessons, recorder groups, or percussion ensembles. Teach pupils to listen across the ensemble while playing their own part. Use simple conducting gestures to direct starts, stops and dynamic changes. Develop listening challenges: can pupils hear all the parts? Can they identify when their part is dominant and when it should blend? Use rounds and partner songs to develop independent part-playing.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often focus only on their own part and do not listen to others in an ensemble. Teaching that ensemble music requires active listening as well as playing is key. Some pupils may feel that playing quietly means playing badly; teaching about musical balance and the importance of dynamic blend within an ensemble addresses this.

**Key vocabulary:** ensemble, solo, blend, balance, part, conductor, cue, coordination, listen, independent, unison, harmony

**MU-KS2-D001-CL001:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Ensemble performance is a system in which individual parts must function in coordinated relationship — listening, balance, cueing and musical communication are all properties of the ensemble as an interdependent system rather than of individual players.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Accuracy and fluency in performance depend on internalising rhythmic and melodic patterns deeply enough to reproduce them reliably under the added cognitive load of ensemble coordination.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

## Domain: MU-KS2-D002 — Improvising and Composing
**Subject:** Music | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
At KS2, pupils extend their KS1 sound exploration to more structured improvisation and composition, developing understanding of how musical ideas are organised into compositions. The curriculum specifies that pupils should organise and manipulate ideas within musical structures and reproduce sounds from aural memory, indicating a more deliberate and structurally aware approach to composition. Improvisation teaches pupils to make spontaneous musical decisions, developing musical fluency and creative confidence. Composition for a range of purposes introduces the idea that music is created in response to contexts, briefs and audiences, connecting music making to communication and expression.

### Concepts (2)

#### MU-KS2-C002 — Improvisation
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Improvisation is the creation of music spontaneously in performance, without prior written notation. It requires musical knowledge and skill, creative confidence and the ability to make instant decisions. At KS2, pupils develop improvisation skills through structured activities that provide a framework (scale, rhythm, harmonic context) within which they can make free musical choices.

**Teaching guidance:** Begin with very structured improvisation frameworks - improvise using only two or three notes over a drone or ostinato. Gradually increase freedom by expanding the note set or the rhythmic palette. Use call-and-response structures. Encourage pupils to improvise short phrases and to listen to and build on each other's ideas. Discuss the difference between improvisation (spontaneous) and composition (planned). Connect to listening by pointing out improvisation in jazz and world music examples.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often fear improvisation because they believe there is a 'right answer'. Framing improvisation as creative exploration rather than performance of a correct sequence helps. Some pupils may produce random sequences of notes rather than musical phrases; teaching phrase length and resolution helps develop more musical improvisation.

**Key vocabulary:** improvise, spontaneous, phrase, motif, scale, drone, ostinato, response, idea, explore, create, structure

#### MU-KS2-C003 — Musical Structure and Composition
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Musical structure refers to the way a composition is organised over time - how musical ideas are introduced, developed, contrasted and repeated. Common structural forms include binary (AB), ternary (ABA), rondo (ABACADA) and theme and variations. At KS2, pupils develop understanding of musical structure as they compose music for a range of purposes, learning to organise musical ideas intentionally.

**Teaching guidance:** Analyse structure in listening examples by identifying where ideas return, contrast and develop. Use graphic notation or simple letter notation (A, B, C) to map the structure of pieces. Set composition tasks that require pupils to use a specific structure. Encourage revision of compositional structure in the light of evaluation. Connect structure to the purpose of the music - a lullaby might have repetitive, soothing sections; a piece for a film chase scene would have contrasting fast and slow sections.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often compose music that simply continues without structural contrast or repetition, resulting in a stream of unconnected ideas. Teaching basic structural forms and asking pupils to plan structure before composing prevents this. Some pupils may repeat material too mechanically; discussing how professional composers introduce subtle variations of repeated material develops more sophisticated structural thinking.

**Key vocabulary:** structure, form, binary, ternary, rondo, verse, chorus, bridge, motif, theme, variation, contrast, repetition, development

**MU-KS2-D002-CL001:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Musical Structure and Composition (C003) makes structure the explicit object of compositional learning — understanding how sections, motifs and structural forms organise musical material to create coherent expressive effect.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Improvisation develops the ability to generate melodic and rhythmic patterns spontaneously within stylistic constraints; composition extends this by deliberately selecting, combining and repeating patterns to create planned musical architecture.

## Domain: MU-KS2-D003 — Listening and Aural Development
**Subject:** Music | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
Active and discriminating listening is central to KS2 music education. Pupils listen with attention to detail, identifying and describing musical features, structures and expressive devices with increasing sophistication. The development of aural memory - the ability to recall and reproduce sounds - is a specific target, connecting listening to performing and composing. Pupils are expected to appreciate and understand a wide range of high-quality live and recorded music drawn from different traditions and from great composers and musicians, and to develop an understanding of the history of music, giving listening a historical and cultural dimension that supports broader musical understanding.

### Concepts (1)

#### MU-KS2-C005 — Music History and Cultural Context
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Music has a rich history spanning many centuries and cultures, with different traditions, genres and styles each having distinctive features and contexts. At KS2, pupils develop understanding of the history of music and appreciation for a wide range of musical traditions, including the works of great composers and musicians. This historical and cultural knowledge enriches pupils' listening and informs their own musical making.

**Teaching guidance:** Use listening examples from a wide range of historical periods and musical traditions, including Western classical, folk, jazz, world music and popular music. Connect composers and their music to their historical context - what was happening in the world when this music was written? Use simple timelines to place music historically. Connect music history to history in other subjects. Encourage pupils to develop preferences and to articulate why they prefer certain music using musical vocabulary.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may assume that 'good' music means Western classical music. Deliberately presenting diverse musical traditions as equally valid challenges this. Pupils may not understand that musical preferences are shaped by culture and experience; discussing how exposure influences taste develops critical musical understanding.

**Key vocabulary:** composer, period, Baroque, Classical, Romantic, contemporary, tradition, genre, style, culture, influence, folk, jazz, classical, heritage

**MU-KS2-D003-CL001:**
- **Perspective and Interpretation** (primary): Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?
  Why: Appreciating music from diverse traditions and historical periods requires pupils to listen from within unfamiliar aesthetic frameworks — recognising that what counts as musical quality is culturally and historically situated, not universal.
  AI instruction: Use the PERSPECTIVE AND INTERPRETATION lens: prompt pupils to identify the author's or actor's viewpoint, consider what information or experience shapes that perspective, look for omissions or contradictions, and compare multiple accounts.

- **Continuity and Change Over Time**: What has stayed the same, what has changed, and what drove that change?
  Why: The historical dimension of this cluster — encountering music across different periods — requires pupils to notice how musical styles, conventions and cultural functions have evolved, persisted and changed across time.

## Domain: MU-KS2-D004 — Musical Notation
**Subject:** Music | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** knowledge

### Curriculum Context
KS2 introduces formal staff notation as a tool for reading and recording musical ideas. Pupils learn to use both staff notation and other relevant notations, understanding that notation is a means of communicating musical ideas rather than an end in itself. The ability to read notation supports performance by allowing pupils to learn new pieces independently and to rehearse from written scores. Understanding notation also supports composition by giving pupils a way to record and share their musical ideas. Staff notation connects music education to a long written tradition and to the practice of professional musicians and composers.

### Concepts (1)

#### MU-KS2-C004 — Staff Notation
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Staff notation is the standardised system of writing music using a five-line stave, clefs, note heads and rhythmic values. It allows music to be written down accurately and communicated to performers who have not heard the piece. At KS2, pupils learn to read and write staff notation, beginning with treble clef notes and simple rhythmic values, connecting this to their instrumental learning and composition work.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce staff notation in the context of instrumental learning, connecting written symbols to sounds pupils already know. Use mnemonics for note names (Every Good Boy Deserves Football for EGBDF). Practice reading short melodic fragments by ear first, then by sight. Teach rhythmic values (crotchet, minim, quaver) alongside their sound and feel. Use pupils' own compositions as a context for notation practice. Emphasise that notation represents sound; always connect written symbols to the sounds they represent.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils sometimes learn note names as abstract symbols without connecting them to specific sounds on their instrument. Always reinforcing the sound alongside the symbol prevents disconnected learning. The time signature is often misunderstood as a fraction rather than as information about pulse grouping; consistent practical activities reinforce its musical meaning.

**Key vocabulary:** stave, clef, treble, note, pitch, crotchet, minim, semibreve, quaver, bar line, time signature, rest, sharp, flat, natural

**MU-KS2-D004-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Staff notation is a systematic visual encoding of rhythmic and pitch patterns; learning to read and write it requires developing fluent pattern recognition between visual symbols and their corresponding sounds.

Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Structure and Function**: How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

## Domain: DT-KS2-D001 — Design
**Subject:** Design and Technology | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
At KS2, the design domain requires pupils to conduct research to understand user needs and to use that research to inform the development of design criteria. Pupils move beyond simple drawing to use annotated sketches, cross-sectional and exploded diagrams, prototypes, pattern pieces and computer-aided design as communication tools. The progression from KS1 is marked by the introduction of research, the explicit consideration of specific target users or groups, and the use of more sophisticated visual communication methods. Pupils learn that effective design is evidence-based and user-centred, and that design ideas need to be communicated clearly enough to be made by others.

### Concepts (2)

#### DT-KS2-C001 — Research-Informed Design
Type: process | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

At KS2, effective design is grounded in research that identifies the needs, preferences and constraints relevant to a product. Research may involve interviewing potential users, examining existing products, investigating materials, or exploring relevant contexts. The findings from research are used to develop design criteria that shape the design process and provide the basis for evaluation.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach pupils to conduct structured research before designing - this could include interviews with target users, surveys, product analysis or contextual investigation. Model how to translate research findings into design criteria. Show examples of real product development processes where research has informed design. Provide structured templates that connect research findings to design decisions. Discuss what makes a product 'fit for purpose' in terms of user needs.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may begin designing before completing meaningful research. Establishing the design brief and research phase as required steps prevents this. Some pupils conflate research with simply looking at existing products without identifying specific needs or constraints.

**Key vocabulary:** research, user need, target user, design brief, design criteria, fit for purpose, context, investigate, analyse, inform

#### DT-KS2-C002 — Technical Drawing and Design Communication
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Technical drawing involves representing design ideas using conventions that communicate information about how a product looks, how it is constructed and how its parts relate to each other. At KS2, pupils learn to use annotated sketches, cross-sectional diagrams, exploded diagrams, pattern pieces and computer-aided design to communicate their ideas clearly and accurately to others who will make or evaluate the product.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach specific drawing conventions including labelling, dimensioning and cross-sections. Practice exploded diagrams to show how components fit together. Introduce appropriate computer-aided design tools for generating and presenting design ideas. Discuss why designers need to communicate their ideas clearly to others, such as when a design is made by someone other than the designer. Compare technical drawings with artistic drawings to highlight different purposes.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may treat all drawing in DT as artistic expression rather than technical communication. Establishing that technical drawing has specific conventions and purposes helps. Some pupils may find exploded and cross-sectional diagrams conceptually challenging; building up from physical disassembly of real objects helps develop the mental model.

**Key vocabulary:** annotated sketch, cross-section, exploded diagram, prototype, pattern piece, computer-aided design, dimension, label, scale, proportion

**DT-KS2-D001-CL001:**
- **Evidence and Argument** (primary): What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Research-informed design requires pupils to use evidence gathered about user needs and existing products to justify their design criteria — each design decision becomes a claim that must be supported by research evidence.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'
- **Structure and Function**: How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Technical drawing (annotated sketches, exploded diagrams) communicates not just what the product looks like but how its structure will enable its function — annotating design decisions makes the structure-function reasoning explicit.

## Domain: DT-KS2-D002 — Make
**Subject:** Design and Technology | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
The make domain at KS2 extends pupils' practical skills to include more complex tools, equipment and processes, and introduces the concept of accuracy as a design requirement. Pupils select from a wider range of materials considering both their functional properties (strength, flexibility, conductivity) and their aesthetic qualities (colour, texture, pattern), demonstrating more sophisticated material knowledge. The emphasis on accuracy reflects the increased complexity of KS2 products and the expectation that pupils can execute their designs with precision. Practical skills are developed in the context of purposeful making across different material areas.

### Concepts (2)

#### DT-KS2-C006 — Accurate Making and Material Processing
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Accurate making refers to the ability to execute practical tasks — measuring, marking out, cutting, shaping, joining and finishing — with precision so that a product matches the design intention and meets functional requirements. At KS2, pupils develop accuracy as a deliberate goal, understanding that imprecise making produces products that do not work correctly or are of poor quality. Material processing knowledge — understanding how different materials respond to cutting, bending, folding, sewing or mixing — enables pupils to select and apply the most effective technique for the material and task at hand.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach measuring and marking out as essential precursors to cutting: measure twice, cut once. Provide opportunities to practise cutting accurately to a marked line with different tools on different materials. Introduce the concept of tolerance: how close to the intended dimension does a measurement need to be for the product to function? Compare products made with and without careful measuring to demonstrate the importance of accuracy. Develop vocabulary for processing different materials: score and fold (card), cut and sew (fabric), chop and mix (food), drill and screw (wood and plastic).

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may rush the measuring and marking stage, leading to cumulative inaccuracies in the finished product. Establishing that time spent measuring carefully is recovered by avoiding mistakes during making is an important lesson. Some pupils equate more material or more joins with a stronger or better product, rather than understanding that precision in fewer, well-executed joins is more effective.

**Key vocabulary:** accuracy, measure, mark out, cut, shape, join, finish, tolerance, material, process, technique, precision, tool, equipment, quality

#### DT-KS2-C007 — Functional and Aesthetic Material Properties
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Materials have both functional properties — characteristics that determine how they perform in use, such as strength, flexibility, conductivity and waterproofness — and aesthetic properties — characteristics that determine how they appear and feel, such as colour, texture, pattern, translucency and surface quality. At KS2, pupils learn to consider both dimensions when selecting materials for a design task, understanding that a material must be both functionally suitable and appropriately appealing for the product to succeed. This concept extends KS1 material knowledge by making the functional/aesthetic distinction explicit.

**Teaching guidance:** Present materials selection tasks that require pupils to balance functional and aesthetic considerations: a container for a child's lunchbox must be both waterproof and visually appealing. Develop systematic material analysis using both dimensions as headings. Discuss real products where functional and aesthetic considerations are in tension — why is medical equipment often plain white rather than brightly coloured? Practise explaining material choices in terms of both functional performance and aesthetic suitability. Investigate how surface finishing techniques can modify aesthetic properties without changing functional ones.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may select materials primarily for their aesthetics (choosing the prettiest fabric) without considering functional requirements. They may also go to the opposite extreme and choose only on functional grounds, producing products that work but are unappealing. Teaching that effective material selection balances both dimensions addresses either tendency.

**Key vocabulary:** functional, aesthetic, property, material, strength, flexibility, conductivity, waterproof, texture, colour, pattern, translucent, opaque, surface, finish

- DT-KS1-C003 (Materials and Their Characteristics) → DT-KS2-C007 (Functional and Aesthetic Material Properties)

### ConceptClusters (1)

**DT-KS2-D002-CL001** — Make accurately using appropriate tools, materials and processes [CURATED]
Type: practice
Concepts: DT-KS2-C006 (Accurate Making and Material Processing), DT-KS2-C007 (Functional and Aesthetic Material Properties)
Rationale: Accurate making (C006) and functional/aesthetic material properties (C007) are deeply intertwined at KS2: selecting the right material (C007) is inseparable from executing the making with precision (C006). Both concepts are practised simultaneously in every making project and naturally co-taught.
Inspired by: NC DT KS2: select from and accurately use a wider range of tools, equipment and materials

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**DT-KS2-D002-CL001:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Selecting functional and aesthetic material properties for a specific application requires pupils to match material characteristics to the structural and functional demands of the product — a direct structure-function reasoning task.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Accurate making involves understanding how tool choices and process sequences cause different surface or structural outcomes — a pupil choosing the wrong cutting technique or material treatment must reason about the causal effect on the finished product.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

### Objectives (2)
- DT-KS2-O003 [statutory]: select from and use a wider range of tools and equipment to perform practical tasks [for example, cutting, shaping, joining and finishing], accurately
- DT-KS2-O004 [statutory]: select from and use a wider range of materials and components, including construction materials, textiles and ingredients, according to their functional properties and aesthetic qualities

## Domain: DT-KS2-D003 — Evaluate
**Subject:** Design and Technology | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
The evaluate domain at KS2 becomes more analytically rigorous, requiring pupils to investigate and analyse existing products in depth. Pupils evaluate their own work against design criteria and also consider the views of others, introducing the concept of user feedback as part of the design process. A distinctive addition at KS2 is the requirement to understand how key events and individuals in design and technology have helped shape the world, giving pupils historical and cultural perspective on the subject. This domain develops pupils' ability to think critically about products, processes and the broader impact of design and technology on society.

### Concepts (2)

#### DT-KS2-C008 — Product Investigation and Analysis
Type: process | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Product investigation involves systematically examining existing products to understand their purpose, intended users, materials, construction methods, mechanisms, aesthetics and how successfully they fulfil their design intent. At KS2, investigation is more structured and analytical than at KS1: pupils use frameworks to compare products, consider both strengths and limitations, and relate findings to their own design work. Understanding how existing products solve design problems is a valuable source of design inspiration and technical knowledge.

**Teaching guidance:** Provide a range of products for pupils to disassemble, examine and discuss. Use a consistent analytical framework: purpose, user, materials, construction, mechanisms, aesthetics, fitness for purpose, cost, sustainability. Encourage comparison between similar products: how does product A solve the problem differently from product B? Connect product analysis to design: what can we learn from this product that will inform our own design? Invite pupils to evaluate how well each product meets its intended purpose and to suggest improvements. Use products from different periods and cultures to build historical and cultural awareness.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may describe products superficially (colour, size, shape) without analysing function, materials or construction. Teaching structured analytical frameworks develops deeper investigation. Some pupils equate 'analyse' with criticise; framing investigation as learning from the solutions others have found is more productive and more accurate.

**Key vocabulary:** investigate, analyse, existing product, purpose, user, material, construction, mechanism, aesthetic, fitness for purpose, evaluate, compare, strength, limitation, improvement

#### DT-KS2-C009 — History and Influence of Design and Technology
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Design and technology has been shaped by key individuals, inventions, events and movements that have transformed how people live, work and communicate. Understanding the historical development of design and technology — from Isambard Kingdom Brunel's engineering to the Apple Macintosh, from the spinning jenny to the Internet — gives pupils perspective on design as a human activity with cultural significance and social impact. At KS2, pupils are introduced to significant moments and people in the history of design and technology and consider how these have influenced the products and systems we use today.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce significant figures in design and technology history with a focus on the problems they were solving and how their solutions changed the world. Connect historical design to contemporary products: how is a modern bridge or bicycle derived from earlier designs? Use timelines to situate developments in historical context. Investigate how design and technology reflects the values and needs of different historical periods. Discuss how design has also created problems: pollution, obsolescence, inequality — alongside its benefits.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may think of design and technology history as a simple story of progress from primitive to advanced. Understanding that design always reflects its cultural context, and that some past innovations created new problems, gives a more nuanced picture. Pupils may not understand the difference between invention (creating something new) and innovation (improving or applying existing ideas); most design and technology history involves both.

**Key vocabulary:** history, inventor, innovation, influence, designer, engineer, industrial revolution, patent, legacy, technology, development, impact, society, culture, evolution

Type: practice
Concepts: DT-KS2-C008 (Product Investigation and Analysis), DT-KS2-C009 (History and Influence of Design and Technology)
Rationale: Product investigation (C008) and the history and influence of D&T (C009) are explicitly co-taught: C009 carries C008 in its co_teach_hints. Investigating existing products is the practical activity through which historical and cultural context becomes meaningful — studying Brunel's bridges or Dyson's vacuums combines both concepts naturally.
Inspired by: NC DT KS2: investigate and analyse existing products; understand how key events and individuals have shaped the world

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**DT-KS2-D003-CL001:**
- **Evidence and Argument** (primary): What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Investigating existing products requires pupils to gather evidence through disassembly and testing, then build an argument about why the product was designed as it was — evaluation is a structured claim supported by evidence from investigation.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'
- **Stability and Change**: What keeps this stable, what causes change, and how quickly does change happen?
  Why: Studying the history and influence of D&T (Brunel, Dyson) asks pupils to understand why designs changed over time — what made earlier solutions insufficient and what new knowledge or materials enabled a better solution — making this a stability-and-change analysis.
  AI instruction: Use the STABILITY AND CHANGE lens: prompt pupils to identify what conditions keep a system in balance, what disrupts equilibrium, and how change can be gradual or sudden. Useful questions: 'What keeps this the same?', 'What would tip it into change?', 'Is the change reversible?', 'How fast is this changing, and why?'

### Objectives (3)

## Domain: DT-KS2-D004 — Technical Knowledge
**Subject:** Design and Technology | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** knowledge

### Curriculum Context
Technical knowledge at KS2 becomes substantially more complex, building on KS1 structural and mechanical exploration to include electrical systems and computing control. Pupils apply understanding of how to strengthen, stiffen and reinforce complex structures, and learn to use mechanical systems including gears, pulleys, cams, levers and linkages. The introduction of electrical systems - series circuits incorporating switches, bulbs, buzzers and motors - enables pupils to create products with active components. The requirement to apply understanding of computing to program, monitor and control products connects design and technology to the computing curriculum and introduces pupils to the principle of embedded intelligence in designed objects.

### Concepts (3)

#### DT-KS2-C003 — Advanced Mechanical Systems
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Mechanical systems use physical components to transmit, redirect or transform motion and force. At KS2, pupils extend their KS1 knowledge of levers, sliders and wheels to include gears, pulleys, cams and linkages, understanding how these more complex mechanisms change the speed, direction and type of movement in a product. Pupils apply this knowledge by incorporating appropriate mechanisms into their own designed products.

**Teaching guidance:** Use construction kits with gear systems to explore how gear ratios affect speed. Investigate pulley systems to explore how they multiply force. Examine cams of different shapes and how they produce different patterns of movement. Study real products that use these mechanisms - clocks, bicycles, engines. Challenge pupils to design products that require a specific type of movement and to select an appropriate mechanism to achieve it.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may confuse gears of different sizes without understanding that larger gears rotate more slowly than smaller ones when meshed. Hands-on investigation with real gear systems is essential. Pupils may not understand that cams produce different patterns of movement depending on their shape - this requires practical investigation of various cam profiles.

**Key vocabulary:** gear, pulley, cam, linkage, lever, rotation, linear motion, oscillation, gear ratio, input motion, output motion, crank, mechanism

#### DT-KS2-C004 — Electrical Systems and Series Circuits
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 2

Electrical systems use the flow of electrical current through components to produce light, sound, heat or movement. At KS2, pupils learn to design and build series circuits incorporating switches, bulbs, buzzers and motors, understanding how these can be used to add active functionality to a designed product. This concept bridges design and technology with science, as understanding of circuits is developed in both subjects.

**Teaching guidance:** Connect to science circuits work by applying electrical knowledge in DT contexts. Build working series circuits as part of product designs - a lit-up toy, a burglar alarm, a motorised vehicle. Teach pupils to represent circuits using standard circuit symbols and to plan their circuits before building. Investigate the effect of adding more bulbs in series. Discuss how electrical components are incorporated in real products and what safety considerations apply.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may not understand that all components in a series circuit must be connected for current to flow, leading to confusion when a broken circuit does not work. Physical construction of circuits reinforces this concept better than diagrams alone. Pupils may confuse the functions of different output components (bulb gives light, buzzer gives sound, motor gives movement).

**Key vocabulary:** circuit, series, component, switch, bulb, buzzer, motor, battery, current, conductor, insulator, symbol, diagram

#### DT-KS2-C005 — Computing Control in Products
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 3 | Teaching weight: 3

Computing can be applied to design and technology to create products that sense inputs, process information and control outputs. At KS2, pupils apply their understanding of programming to program, monitor and control their products, using components such as sensors, microcontrollers and actuators. This concept introduces the idea that modern products often contain embedded software that makes them intelligent and responsive.

**Teaching guidance:** Use programmable microcontrollers such as micro:bit, Arduino or similar platforms suited to primary pupils. Set projects where pupils program a device to respond to sensor input - lighting an LED when it gets dark, making a motor stop when a button is pressed. Connect programming tasks to the DT design process - pupils should design what their product will do, then program it to achieve that function. Evaluate how well the program meets the design criteria.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may see computing control as separate from DT rather than as an integrated part of product design. Framing programming tasks as part of the design-make-evaluate cycle maintains this connection. Some pupils may struggle with the abstraction of programming; physical computing with immediate, visible outputs (LEDs, motors) helps make the logic concrete.

**Key vocabulary:** program, control, sensor, actuator, microcontroller, input, output, condition, sequence, monitor, automate, code

Type: introduction
Concepts: DT-KS2-C003 (Advanced Mechanical Systems)

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**DT-KS2-D004-CL001:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Advanced mechanical systems (gears, pulleys, cams) are studied precisely to understand how their structural arrangement — gear ratios, cam profile, pulley configuration — determines the motion output they produce.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Each mechanical system is a cause-and-effect machine: changing the gear ratio changes the output speed and torque in a predictable way, and pupils must understand these causal relationships to design effective mechanisms.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

**DT-KS2-D004-CL002:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Electrical and computer-controlled systems are multi-component systems where input sensors, a controller, and output actuators interact — pupils must model the system as a whole to design a product where all components work together.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Programming a microcontroller to control a circuit requires pupils to reason about the causal chain from sensor input through program logic to actuator output — every program instruction causes a specific, traceable physical effect.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

## Domain: DT-KS2-D005 — Cooking and Nutrition
**Subject:** Design and Technology | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** knowledge

### Curriculum Context
At KS2, the cooking and nutrition domain deepens pupils' knowledge of nutrition and their practical cooking skills. Pupils understand and apply the principles of a healthy and varied diet to make informed food choices, and they prepare and cook a variety of predominantly savoury dishes using a range of cooking techniques. Understanding seasonality is introduced, helping pupils to connect food production to environmental and agricultural cycles and to understand why certain foods are only available at certain times of year. Knowledge of where and how ingredients are grown, reared, caught and processed gives pupils a more complete picture of the food system from production to consumption.

### Concepts (2)

#### DT-KS2-C010 — Cooking Techniques and Food Preparation
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Cooking techniques are the methods used to prepare and transform food ingredients into dishes: chopping, peeling, grating, mixing, boiling, baking, frying, steaming and so on. Each technique requires specific skills and tools and produces different effects on the food in terms of flavour, texture, colour and nutritional content. At KS2, pupils learn a range of predominantly savoury cooking techniques and apply them to prepare dishes that are balanced, nutritious and appropriately presented. Practical cooking competence supports pupils' ability to feed themselves and others a healthy diet.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach cooking techniques progressively, adding complexity as pupils develop competence. Practise knife skills, food hygiene and safety procedures consistently. Connect cooking to design and technology through the design-make-evaluate cycle: plan a dish, cook it, evaluate it. Discuss how different cooking methods affect the same ingredient: what happens to an onion when it is raw, fried, boiled or roasted? Make predominantly savoury dishes to reflect the curriculum emphasis, covering a range of cooking methods across different projects.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may think that only baking counts as cooking, missing the wide range of cooking methods available. Broadening experience across different techniques challenges this assumption. Food hygiene may seem less interesting than cooking itself; making clear connections between specific hygiene practices and specific risks (cross-contamination, bacteria growth) makes the rationale concrete.

**Key vocabulary:** technique, cook, prepare, ingredient, chop, mix, boil, bake, fry, steam, blend, season, hygiene, safety, nutrition, recipe

#### DT-KS2-C011 — Seasonality and Ingredient Sourcing
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Seasonality refers to the natural cycles by which different foods are available at different times of year. Seasonal ingredients are typically fresher, more nutritious, more economical and have a lower environmental impact because they require less energy-intensive production or long-distance transport. Understanding where and how ingredients are grown, reared, caught and processed — from field to fork — connects pupils to the food system and to issues of environmental and social sustainability in food production.

**Teaching guidance:** Create a seasonal food calendar with pupils, investigating when different fruits and vegetables are in season in the UK. Compare seasonal and out-of-season produce in terms of cost, flavour and food miles. Investigate a food product from shop shelf back to its origin: where was it grown, how was it transported, what processes did it go through? Visit a farm, market or food producer if possible. Cook seasonal dishes using locally sourced ingredients to demonstrate seasonal eating in practice. Connect to science through plant growth cycles and geography through food trade routes.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may not realise that many supermarket products are available year-round because they are imported from other countries or grown in heated greenhouses, both of which have environmental costs. Pupils may equate 'imported' with 'worse' without understanding the complex trade-offs involved; nuanced discussion is more valuable than simple judgements.

**Key vocabulary:** season, seasonal, local, imported, food miles, grow, rear, catch, process, harvest, origin, supply chain, sustainability, fresh, organic

**DT-KS2-D005-CL001:**
- **Cause and Effect** (primary): What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Cooking techniques work through specific physical and chemical transformations — heat causes proteins to denature, acid causes pastry to become flaky — and pupils must understand these causal processes to select and apply techniques correctly.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes.

- **Systems and System Models**: What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?

## Domain: CO-KS12-D002 — Computer Science: Algorithms and Programming (KS2)
**Subject:** Computing | **Key Stage:** KS1 | **Age:** 5-11 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
At KS2, programming develops substantially in sophistication, moving from simple sequences to programs that use the fundamental control structures of computer science: sequence (instructions in order), selection (if-then-else decisions) and repetition (loops). The addition of variables - named storage locations that can hold and change values - enables much more powerful programs. Decomposition (breaking a problem into smaller, manageable parts) is introduced as a strategy for tackling complex programming challenges. The requirement to use logical reasoning to explain how algorithms work develops pupils' ability to analyse and communicate about code, not just to write it. Working with multiple programming languages, including at least one text-based language, broadens pupils' experience of how programming concepts are realised in different syntactic forms.

### Concepts (3)

#### CO-KS12-C001 — Algorithms **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 1 | Teaching weight: 1 | Fan-out: 3

An algorithm is a precise, unambiguous sequence of instructions for solving a problem or accomplishing a task. Algorithms are more general than programs: an algorithm describes what needs to be done, while a program is a specific implementation of an algorithm in a particular programming language. Algorithms must be correct (they produce the right output), precise (each step is unambiguous), and finite (they eventually reach a conclusion). At KS1 and KS2, pupils learn to write and recognise algorithms, understand their properties, and implement them as programs.

**Teaching guidance:** Begin with unplugged algorithm activities before moving to digital programming. Teach pupils to write step-by-step instructions for everyday tasks (making a sandwich, brushing teeth) to illustrate the precision required in algorithms. Use robot or turtle-following activities where pupils give instructions and observe the results of ambiguity or incorrect ordering. Discuss what happens when an algorithm has an error: the program does what we said, not what we meant. Introduce the idea of testing algorithms with different inputs to check they work in all cases.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may think that an algorithm is the same as a program; clarifying that an algorithm is the idea or plan, while a program is the specific coded implementation, is important. Pupils may not appreciate that algorithms need to be unambiguous; activities where deliberately ambiguous instructions lead to unexpected results make this vivid. The idea that a computer does exactly what it is told, rather than what we intended, is a fundamental shift in thinking that needs explicit attention.

**Key vocabulary:** algorithm, instruction, sequence, step, precise, unambiguous, input, output, process, program, implement, order, correct, test, debug

#### CO-KS12-C002 — Programming: Sequence, Selection and Repetition
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 2

All programs are built from three fundamental control structures: sequence (instructions executed in order, one after another), selection (conditional branches where different instructions execute depending on a condition - if/then/else) and repetition (loops where instructions repeat a specified number of times or while a condition holds). These three structures are sufficient to express any computable algorithm, and mastery of them is the core of programming competence. At KS2, pupils learn to use all three structures in their programs, developing increasingly sophisticated and efficient code.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce each control structure separately before combining them. Use visual block-based programming environments (Scratch, Blockly) initially to reduce syntax barriers. Progress to text-based languages at upper KS2 to develop more precise understanding of programming syntax. Always connect programming tasks to a genuine purpose: a game, an animation, a simulation. Teach debugging systematically: read the code line by line, trace the execution, identify where actual behaviour diverges from expected behaviour. Celebrate debugging success as much as successful first attempts.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often use loops incorrectly, either not using them when repetition is present (writing the same instruction multiple times) or using them in inappropriate contexts. Explicit comparison of repetitive code versus loop code makes the efficiency benefit clear. Selection (if/then/else) is conceptually more demanding; pupils may write conditions that cannot be true, or miss the else case. Tracing through conditional code step by step makes the logic visible.

**Key vocabulary:** sequence, selection, repetition, loop, conditional, if, then, else, while, for, variable, input, output, debug, program, code, execute, trace

#### CO-KS12-C006 — Decomposition and Computational Thinking
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2

Computational thinking is a set of problem-solving approaches that involve breaking problems down (decomposition), identifying patterns (pattern recognition), focusing on the most relevant information (abstraction) and developing step-by-step solutions (algorithm design). Decomposition - breaking a complex problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems - is particularly important in programming, as it enables pupils to tackle problems that would otherwise be too large to address as a whole. At KS2, pupils apply decomposition to design programs and to plan complex digital projects.

**Teaching guidance:** Model decomposition explicitly when setting programming tasks: show how a complex program can be broken into components (an animation with a background, a character, sound, score). Ask pupils to plan their program structure before coding. Teach the use of procedures and functions as a way of organising decomposed code. Practice decomposition in non-computing contexts: planning an event, organising a research project. Connect decomposition to the design stage of the design-make-evaluate cycle. Use flowcharts and pseudocode to represent decomposed algorithms before implementing them.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may attempt to solve programming challenges as a single, undivided problem rather than decomposing them. Modelling the decomposition process explicitly, and requiring pupils to plan before coding, develops this habit. Abstraction (ignoring irrelevant detail) can be conceptually challenging; concrete examples of what to include and what to leave out in specific contexts help. Pupils may not see the connection between computational thinking and problem-solving in other domains; deliberate cross-curricular examples broaden the concept.

**Key vocabulary:** decomposition, computational thinking, abstraction, pattern recognition, algorithm, problem-solving, sub-problem, procedure, function, modular, plan, flowchart, pseudocode, design

**CO-KS12-D002-CL001** — Understand algorithms and apply computational thinking [CURATED] [KEYSTONE]
Type: introduction
Concepts: CO-KS12-C001 (Algorithms), CO-KS12-C006 (Decomposition and Computational Thinking)
Rationale: Algorithms and decomposition/computational thinking are tightly co-taught at KS2: understanding what an algorithm is (C001) is the prerequisite for decomposing problems into algorithms (C006), and C006 lists C001 in its co_teach_hints. Together they form the conceptual foundation before programming practice.

Type: practice
Sequenced after: CO-KS12-D002-CL001
Concepts: CO-KS12-C002 (Programming: Sequence, Selection and Repetition)
Rationale: Programming with the three control structures (sequence, selection, repetition) is the practical application domain at KS2, distinct from the conceptual/algorithmic cluster. Pupils apply their understanding of algorithms by implementing them in programs.
Inspired by: NC Computing KS2: design, write and debug programs

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**CO-KS12-D002-CL001:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Decomposition requires pupils to model a complex problem as a system of smaller interacting parts — understanding that the whole can be broken into components that each perform a defined function is a systems-thinking act.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Algorithms are fundamentally repeatable patterns of instruction; recognising that the same problem type can be solved with the same algorithmic pattern is the key generalisation pupils must form at this stage.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

**CO-KS12-D002-CL002:**
- **Cause and Effect** (primary): What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Writing and debugging programs with sequence, selection and repetition demands that pupils predict the effect of each control structure — tracing how changing a condition in a selection statement changes what the program does is a direct cause-and-effect analysis.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: The three control structures are themselves patterns of execution; pupils must recognise which structural pattern (loop, branch, sequence) is the right template for a given problem, applying pattern recognition to programming design choices.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

### Objectives (3)

## Domain: CO-KS12-D004 — Digital Literacy and IT Skills (KS2)
**Subject:** Computing | **Key Stage:** KS1 | **Age:** 5-11 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
Digital literacy at KS2 develops from practical creation skills to include understanding of the digital infrastructure that makes communication and collaboration possible. Pupils learn how computer networks work, how the internet connects networks globally, and how communication over the internet works. Critically, pupils develop understanding of how search technologies work and how results are ranked, which is essential for developing the critical evaluation skills needed to use internet resources effectively and safely. The expansion of software skills to include selecting and combining multiple applications develops the technological versatility and problem-solving mindset of confident digital users. Online safety at KS2 becomes more sophisticated, addressing issues of personal information, digital footprints, cyberbullying and evaluating online content.

### Concepts (1)

#### CO-KS12-C004 — Networks, the Internet and the World Wide Web
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

A computer network is a collection of computing devices connected together to share data and resources. The internet is the global network of networks, connecting millions of devices worldwide using a common set of protocols. The World Wide Web is a service built on the internet, comprising web pages accessed via browsers. Email, messaging and streaming are other internet services. At KS2, pupils develop conceptual understanding of how networks and the internet work, distinguishing between physical infrastructure and the services that run on top of it.

**Teaching guidance:** Use diagrams to show how devices are connected in a local network and how local networks connect via the internet. Discuss the difference between the internet (the physical and logical infrastructure) and the web (a service accessed via the internet). Explore how data travels across the internet in packets. Investigate the role of search engines and how they index and rank pages. Connect to digital safety: understanding how the internet works underpins understanding of online privacy and data. Use analogies: the postal system as an analogy for internet protocols.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often confuse the internet with the World Wide Web, using the terms interchangeably. Establishing that the web is one service on the internet (alongside email, streaming etc.) is a key conceptual correction. Pupils may think the internet is a physical 'place' rather than a network of connected devices; using physical metaphors (roads, postal networks) helps make the infrastructure tangible. The idea that data travels in packets, potentially by different routes, is counterintuitive to many pupils.

**Key vocabulary:** network, internet, World Wide Web, website, browser, server, router, packet, protocol, IP address, search engine, hyperlink, URL, data, bandwidth

### ConceptClusters (1)

**CO-KS12-D004-CL001** — Understand computer networks and use search technologies critically [CURATED]
Type: practice
Concepts: CO-KS12-C004 (Networks, the Internet and the World Wide Web)
Rationale: Networks and the Internet is the sole concept in the KS2 digital literacy domain, covering both the infrastructure of the internet and the digital literacy skill of evaluating search results. A single precise cluster correctly covers the domain.
Inspired by: NC Computing KS2: understand computer networks including the internet

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**CO-KS12-D004-CL001:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Understanding the internet as a network requires pupils to model how devices, routers and servers interact as a system — each component has a role and the system's behaviour emerges from how the parts communicate.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Evidence and Argument**: What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?
  Why: Evaluating search results critically requires pupils to assess the quality and reliability of evidence — deciding whether a source is trustworthy is an argument-evaluation task grounded in evidence appraisal.
  AI instruction: Use the EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion, evaluate source reliability, construct claims with supporting evidence, and anticipate counter-arguments. Useful questions: 'What evidence supports this?', 'How reliable is this source?', 'What would count as evidence against it?', 'Is the conclusion the only one the evidence supports?'

### Objectives (4)
- CO-KS12-O010 [statutory]: understand computer networks including the internet; how they can provide multiple services, such as the world wide web; and the opportunities they offer for communication and collaboration
- CO-KS12-O011 [statutory]: use search technologies effectively, appreciate how results are selected and ranked, and be discerning in evaluating digital content
- CO-KS12-O012 [statutory]: select, use and combine a variety of software (including internet services) on a range of digital devices to design and create a range of programs, systems and content that accomplish given goals
- CO-KS12-O013 [statutory]: use technology safely, respectfully and responsibly; recognise acceptable/unacceptable behaviour; identify a range of ways to report concerns about content and contact

## Domain: LA-KS2-D001 — Listening and Speaking
**Subject:** Languages | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
Oral language skills form the foundation of language acquisition, and the primary languages curriculum gives listening and speaking particular prominence at KS2. Pupils must listen attentively to authentic spoken language and respond appropriately, developing the ability to tolerate ambiguity and extract meaning even when not every word is understood. Exploring patterns and sounds through songs and rhymes is not merely motivational but develops phonological awareness of the new language's sound system, which differs from English in pitch, rhythm, stress and specific phonemes. The specification that pupils should speak with accurate pronunciation and intonation from the outset establishes high expectations: being understood in a foreign language requires phonological precision that must be developed through consistent feedback and modelling.

### Concepts (2)

#### LA-KS2-C001 — Phonology and Pronunciation **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: skill | Complexity: 1 | Teaching weight: 1 | Fan-out: 3

Each language has a distinctive phonological system: the set of sounds (phonemes) it uses, the rules for combining them, and the patterns of stress and intonation that give spoken language its characteristic sound. Learning a foreign language requires developing a new phonological awareness that may include sounds not present in English, different stress patterns and different intonation contours. At KS2, systematic attention to pronunciation from the earliest stages prevents the fossilisation of incorrect patterns and develops the phonological foundation for authentic spoken communication.

**Teaching guidance:** Use songs, rhymes and chants to introduce and practise the sound system of the target language. Model pronunciation precisely and ask pupils to echo-repeat. Use minimal pairs (words that differ by one sound) to develop discrimination of similar sounds. Record pupils speaking and play back so they can hear their own pronunciation. Teach the specific sounds of the target language that differ from English (nasal vowels in French, the rolled r in Spanish). Connect spelling to sound regularly: what does this letter combination sound like in this language? Use phonics-style activities adapted for the target language.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may assume that letters in the target language are pronounced as in English. Systematic attention to differences in sound-spelling correspondence prevents fossilisation of incorrect patterns. Some pupils may feel embarrassed to make unfamiliar sounds; creating a playful, low-stakes environment for sound exploration reduces inhibition. Teachers may unconsciously accept poor pronunciation as adequate; consistently modelling and expecting accurate pronunciation maintains high standards.

**Key vocabulary:** pronunciation, intonation, stress, phoneme, sound, syllable, rhythm, accent, tone, vowel, consonant, nasal, rolling, liaison, elision

#### LA-KS2-C004 — Communicative Competence
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Communicative competence is the ability to use language effectively in real communicative situations, combining linguistic accuracy with the social and cultural knowledge needed to communicate appropriately in different contexts. It encompasses grammatical competence (correct forms), sociolinguistic competence (appropriate register and context), discourse competence (organising longer stretches of language coherently) and strategic competence (managing communication despite gaps in knowledge). At KS2, pupils begin to develop communicative competence through structured interaction, role-play and authentic communication tasks.

**Teaching guidance:** Design tasks that require genuine communication: information gaps, problem-solving activities, surveys. Use role-play scenarios that develop contextually appropriate language (shopping, asking directions, at a restaurant). Develop pupils' ability to manage communication difficulties: use of circumlocution, asking for clarification, using cognates. Encourage pupils to take communicative risks and reward successful communication even when grammatically imperfect. Connect language learning to cultural awareness: how do greetings, politeness conventions and social norms differ in the target language culture?

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may believe that making a grammatical error means they have failed to communicate. Distinguishing between grammatical accuracy and communicative success, and valuing both, develops more confident communicators. Some pupils are reluctant to speak without certainty of accuracy; developing tolerance of ambiguity and risk-taking in communication is important. Pupils may see languages as sets of rules to be memorised rather than tools for communication; keeping the communicative purpose central prevents this.

**Key vocabulary:** communicate, conversation, question, answer, response, opinion, clarify, understand, explain, describe, interact, context, appropriate, fluent, confident

Rationale: Phonology and pronunciation (C001) and communicative competence (C004) are the two essential dimensions of oracy in a foreign language at KS2: pupils must develop accurate sound production (C001) in order to communicate meaningfully (C004). Both are practised together in every listening and speaking activity.

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**LA-KS2-D001-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Phonology and pronunciation in a foreign language is built on recognising and internalising the sound patterns of the target language — pupils must perceive and reproduce the phonemic patterns that differ from English.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Perspective and Interpretation**: Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?
  Why: Communicative competence requires pupils to adapt their language to the listener's needs and the conversational context — a perspective-taking skill that goes beyond accuracy to encompass appropriacy and audience awareness.
  AI instruction: Use the PERSPECTIVE AND INTERPRETATION lens: prompt pupils to identify the author's or actor's viewpoint, consider what information or experience shapes that perspective, look for omissions or contradictions, and compare multiple accounts. Useful questions: 'Who wrote/said this, and why?', 'What might they have left out?', 'How would someone else see this differently?', 'What would change your view?'

## Domain: LA-KS2-D002 — Reading
**Subject:** Languages | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
Reading in a foreign language at KS2 connects oral language acquisition to the written form, supporting pupils in making connections between sounds and their written representations. Pupils are expected to read carefully, bringing to bear the phonic awareness developed through listening and speaking. The requirement to appreciate stories, songs, poems and rhymes in the language introduces pupils to authentic literary and cultural texts, developing cultural awareness alongside language skills. Developing the ability to understand unfamiliar words through context is a key metacognitive strategy that enables learners to operate with increasing independence, rather than depending on translation for every unknown word.

### Concepts (1)

#### LA-KS2-C006 — Reading in the Target Language
Type: skill | Complexity: 1 | Teaching weight: 1 | Fan-out: 1

Reading in a foreign language requires pupils to decode written text using their phonological knowledge of the target language's sound-spelling correspondences, while simultaneously applying vocabulary and grammatical knowledge to construct meaning. At KS2, pupils develop the ability to read words, phrases and simple texts in the target language with careful attention to meaning, making use of context and dictionaries to resolve unfamiliar vocabulary. Engagement with stories, songs, poems and rhymes in the written form of the target language develops both decoding skill and cultural engagement, as pupils encounter the imaginative and literary traditions of the target language community.

**Teaching guidance:** Connect reading to the oral language pupils have already encountered: what they can say, they should be able to read. Build reading from familiar phrases and vocabulary before introducing unfamiliar written material. Use shared reading of simple texts with visual support (images, diagrams) to develop reading for meaning. Teach dictionary use as a strategy for resolving unfamiliar vocabulary, including the skill of identifying headwords and selecting the correct meaning from multiple options. Engage pupils with songs, poems and simple stories in the target language as authentic reading material that is motivating and culturally rich. Develop the ability to read aloud with accurate pronunciation, connecting spelling to sound in the target language.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may attempt to read target language text using English sound-spelling correspondences, producing systematic mispronunciation. Consistent phonics-based teaching of the target language's sound system prevents this. Some pupils may believe that understanding every word is necessary before any meaning can be extracted; teaching reading for gist and the use of context to infer meaning develops more effective reading strategies. Dictionary use may be seen as admitting failure rather than as a competent reading strategy; normalising dictionary use as a skilled behaviour encourages its effective application.

**Key vocabulary:** read, text, word, phrase, sentence, meaning, understand, dictionary, vocabulary, story, poem, song, rhyme, decode, pronunciation, spelling

- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Decoding written text in a foreign language requires pupils to recognise the grapheme-phoneme correspondence patterns of the target language — mapping written symbols to sounds follows pattern recognition rather than rule application at this stage.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

## Domain: LA-KS2-D003 — Writing
**Subject:** Languages | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
Writing in a foreign language at KS2 develops through the adaptation and creation of phrases rather than free composition. Pupils begin by writing phrases from memory - demonstrating that they can reproduce language without copying - and progress to adapting learned phrases to create new sentences, demonstrating productive competence rather than merely reproductive ability. The requirement to describe people, places, things and actions across a range of contexts ensures that writing develops in breadth. Understanding and applying basic grammar - including feminine, masculine and neuter forms, the conjugation of high-frequency verbs, key features of sentence structure, and the use of conjunctions to extend sentences - develops the structural understanding that enables creative language use beyond set phrases.

### Concepts (1)

#### LA-KS2-C007 — Writing in the Target Language
Type: skill | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Writing in a foreign language at KS2 begins with reproducing and adapting learned phrases, developing pupils' ability to express ideas in the written form of the target language without copying from a visual prompt. Starting with phrases from memory demonstrates that language has been internalised, not merely copied. Adapting learned phrases to create new sentences is a crucial step towards productive competence: pupils apply their grammatical knowledge (of gender, verb forms, word order) to create language beyond the specific examples they have been taught. Describing people, places, things and actions across a range of topics develops the breadth of written productive ability.

**Teaching guidance:** Scaffold the progression from copying to independent writing carefully: begin with supported writing frames, move to partially completed sentences, then to writing from memory prompts, then to unprompted writing. Teach pupils to check their writing for accuracy: does the adjective agree with the noun? Is the verb conjugated correctly? Is the word order correct? Use writing as consolidation after oral practice: what pupils can say, they should be able to write. Develop pupils' use of a bilingual dictionary or glossary for self-checking rather than for word-by-word translation. Celebrate writing as a means of communication: display and share what pupils write, and where possible use writing for real communicative purposes (pen pal letters, class books, display captions).

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may produce writing by copying from classroom displays or books rather than from memory; building in activities that require independent recall (covering the model before writing) develops genuine productive competence. Pupils may view written accuracy as the only criterion for good writing; developing the ability to communicate meaning effectively even with some errors alongside developing accuracy produces more confident writers. Some pupils may feel that they cannot write in a foreign language; scaffolded, achievable writing tasks with clear success criteria build confidence before demanding more extended production.

**Key vocabulary:** write, phrase, sentence, describe, adapt, create, express, memory, idea, topic, people, place, action, accurate, check, grammar

**LA-KS2-D003-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Adapting learned phrases to new contexts depends on recognising the structural patterns underlying those phrases — noticing that a greeting pattern, a colour agreement, or a number pattern can be recombined to produce new sentences.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Correct spelling in a foreign language is governed by phoneme-grapheme rules where making the wrong choice causes an intelligibility or accuracy failure — pupils must understand how each spelling decision affects the written form produced.

## Domain: LA-KS2-D004 — Grammar and Vocabulary
**Subject:** Languages | **Key Stage:** KS2 | **Age:** 7-11 | **Structure:** knowledge

### Curriculum Context
Grammar and vocabulary are the structural and lexical building blocks of language proficiency. At KS2, pupils develop understanding of key grammatical features of the target language, which typically differ substantially from English: grammatical gender (feminine, masculine, neuter), number (singular and plural), case (where relevant), verb conjugation and sentence structure. This grammatical knowledge is not taught for its own sake but to enable pupils to communicate with greater accuracy and flexibility. Vocabulary development is equally important: a broad vocabulary spanning personal, social, environmental and cultural domains provides the lexical resources for authentic communication. Developing the habit of learning new vocabulary systematically, and strategies for remembering and using it, is as important as the specific vocabulary learned.

### Concepts (3)

#### LA-KS2-C002 — Vocabulary Acquisition and Use **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 1 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 4

Vocabulary is the core building material of language: without words, grammar cannot operate and communication is impossible. Effective vocabulary acquisition involves encountering new words in context, understanding their meaning, form and use, practising them in a variety of ways, and storing them in long-term memory for retrieval in communication. At KS2, pupils build a working vocabulary across a range of topics (personal information, family, school, food, animals, weather, place and time), developing both receptive vocabulary (words recognised when heard or read) and productive vocabulary (words actively used in speaking and writing).

**Teaching guidance:** Teach vocabulary in meaningful chunks (phrases, sentences, contexts) rather than isolated word lists. Use multiple modalities for vocabulary practice: hear it, say it, read it, write it, act it out. Introduce vocabulary in manageable sets and revise regularly using spaced practice. Use picture flashcards, word games, memory techniques (association, visualisation) and word maps. Connect new vocabulary to words pupils already know in English or other languages. Teach pupils to use dictionaries and simple vocabulary lists independently. Develop pupils' awareness of patterns in vocabulary across the language.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may believe that learning vocabulary means translating word lists. Teaching vocabulary in context and through use challenges this. Pupils may not use deliberate strategies to memorise vocabulary; teaching a range of memory techniques (visual associations, spaced practice, self-testing) develops more effective vocabulary learning habits. The distinction between receptive and productive vocabulary is important: recognising a word when heard is different from being able to use it spontaneously.

**Key vocabulary:** vocabulary, word, phrase, meaning, context, translate, dictionary, category, topic, receptive, productive, revise, memorise, association, cognate

#### LA-KS2-C003 — Grammar: Gender, Number and Verb Conjugation **[KEYSTONE]**
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 3

Many languages assign grammatical gender to nouns (masculine, feminine, and in some languages neuter), which affects the form of articles, adjectives and pronouns that accompany them. Number (singular and plural) affects verb and noun forms. Verb conjugation refers to the way verbs change their form depending on the subject (person and number). These grammatical structures are fundamental to producing grammatically correct speech and writing in most European languages. At KS2, pupils develop understanding of these features and learn to apply them in the context of the language being studied.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach grammatical gender systematically from the first introduction of nouns: always introduce a noun with its article (le chat, la maison). Use colour-coding to help pupils distinguish masculine and feminine. Provide extensive practice of high-frequency verbs (to be, to have, to go, to want, to like) in all their conjugated forms. Highlight patterns within paradigms: verbs that share endings, nouns that share gender markers. Connect grammar to communication: knowing that adjectives agree with nouns enables pupils to describe things accurately. Use grammatical metalanguage (gender, conjugate, plural) from the start.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils accustomed to English may not understand why nouns have gender in other languages. Explaining that grammatical gender is a linguistic feature, not a reflection of real-world gender, prevents confusion. Pupils may not see the relevance of learning verb conjugation; connecting it to the ability to talk about different people (I, you, he, she) makes the functional purpose clear. Irregular verbs (which are often the most common) require extra attention; pupils may apply regular patterns to irregular forms.

**Key vocabulary:** gender, masculine, feminine, neuter, singular, plural, article, noun, verb, conjugate, subject, agree, tense, person, form

#### LA-KS2-C005 — Language Awareness and Transfer
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 2 | Teaching weight: 2 | Fan-out: 1

Language awareness refers to an explicit understanding of how languages work as systems, including how the target language is similar to and different from English and from other languages the pupil may know. This metalinguistic awareness supports language learning in multiple ways: it helps pupils to identify cognates (words similar across languages), to apply understanding of grammatical categories across languages, and to develop strategies for tackling unfamiliar language. Language transfer - applying knowledge from one language to another - can both facilitate learning (positive transfer) and cause errors (negative transfer or interference).

**Teaching guidance:** Regularly draw attention to similarities and differences between the target language and English. Explore cognates: words that are similar in form and meaning. Discuss how the grammatical concepts introduced in the target language (gender, verb conjugation, case) relate to or differ from English. Use linguistic metalanguage consistently: verb, noun, adjective, sentence, tense. Develop pupils' awareness of their own language learning processes: what strategies work for them? Encourage pupils who speak other languages to share how their languages compare. Connect to English grammar teaching to develop integrated understanding.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may assume that the target language works like English in all respects. Drawing attention to systematic differences prevents negative transfer errors. Pupils may see cognates as confusing rather than helpful; teaching that cognates are a resource for decoding unfamiliar text develops a positive strategy. Pupils who speak languages other than English at home may have significant knowledge that is not recognised or drawn upon; making space for multilingual comparison enriches the learning of all pupils.

Type: introduction
Concepts: LA-KS2-C002 (Vocabulary Acquisition and Use), LA-KS2-C003 (Grammar: Gender, Number and Verb Conjugation)
Rationale: Vocabulary acquisition (C002) and grammar (C003) are the two foundational knowledge components that pupils must develop before they can achieve language awareness and transfer. They are always taught together as the grammatical and lexical building blocks of the target language.
Inspired by: MFL: vocabulary and grammar as enabling knowledge

Type: practice
Sequenced after: LA-KS2-D004-CL001
Concepts: LA-KS2-C005 (Language Awareness and Transfer)
Rationale: Language awareness and transfer (C005) co-teaches with both C002 and C003 and represents a higher-order metacognitive concept: pupils reflect on how the target language relates to English and other known languages. This is taught after and alongside vocabulary and grammar, making it a distinct practice cluster.
Inspired by: MFL KS2: note the patterns and rules that emerge

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**LA-KS2-D004-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Grammar acquisition is fundamentally about internalising the patterns that govern word order, agreement and inflection — pupils must recognise that the same grammatical pattern applies across many different vocabulary items.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Systems and System Models**: What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Vocabulary and grammar together form a generative system: a finite set of words and rules combines to produce an infinite range of utterances, and pupils must begin to model this system to use the language productively.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'

**LA-KS2-D004-CL002:**
- **Perspective and Interpretation** (primary): Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?
  Why: Language awareness requires pupils to step outside their first language and observe both languages as systems from a metalinguistic perspective — noticing similarities and differences in structure is an interpretive act that requires shifting viewpoint.
  AI instruction: Use the PERSPECTIVE AND INTERPRETATION lens: prompt pupils to identify the author's or actor's viewpoint, consider what information or experience shapes that perspective, look for omissions or contradictions, and compare multiple accounts. Useful questions: 'Who wrote/said this, and why?', 'What might they have left out?', 'How would someone else see this differently?', 'What would change your view?'
- **Patterns**: What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: Transfer between languages is enabled by recognising shared patterns — cognates, parallel grammatical structures, or borrowed vocabulary — so pattern recognition across language systems is the cognitive mechanism that makes transfer possible.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'

### Objectives (1)
- LA-KS2-O012 [statutory]: understand basic grammar appropriate to the language being studied, including (where relevant): feminine, masculine and neuter forms and the conjugation of high-frequency verbs; key features and patterns of the language; how to apply these, for instance, to build sentences; and how these differ from or are similar to English

## Domain: PE-KS1-D001 — Physical Skills and Movement
**Subject:** Physical Education | **Key Stage:** KS1 | **Age:** 5-7 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
The foundation of KS1 physical education is the development of fundamental movement skills that underpin all subsequent physical activity. The curriculum specifies mastery of running, jumping, throwing and catching as core skills alongside balance, agility and co-ordination, which together form the physical literacy framework that enables pupils to participate confidently in a wide range of activities. The word 'master' is significant: it implies that pupils should develop genuine competence and fluency rather than merely being introduced to these skills. The application of basic skills across a range of activities ensures that learning transfers beyond single-sport contexts, building the physical confidence and versatility that supports lifelong physical activity.

### Concepts (2)

#### PE-KS1-C001 — Fundamental Movement Skills
Type: skill | Complexity: 1 | Teaching weight: 1 | Fan-out: 2

Fundamental movement skills are the foundational physical competencies that underpin participation in all sports and physical activities. Running, jumping, throwing and catching are the four primary fundamental movement skills specified at KS1; together with balance, agility and co-ordination, they constitute the physical literacy framework. Mastery of these skills in isolation and in combination is the prerequisite for confident, versatile physical participation across the full range of activities in the physical education curriculum.

**Teaching guidance:** Use a range of activities that require each fundamental skill in isolation before combining them. For running: vary pace, direction and pathways; use relay and chasing games. For jumping: explore different take-offs and landings; horizontal and vertical jumps. For throwing and catching: vary distances, sizes of object, and types of throw (underarm, overarm, roll). Develop balance through gymnastics balances and yoga-style holds. Build agility through obstacle courses, tag games and direction-change activities. Use rhythmic activities to develop coordination. Record and celebrate pupils' improving competence over time.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may believe that physical skill is innate rather than developed through practice. Consistent messaging that all skills can be improved with practice and effort develops a physical growth mindset. Some pupils may have significant developmental differences in motor skills; scaffolding and differentiated tasks ensure all pupils can access and progress. Teachers may focus on the most physically able pupils; deliberate attention to the full range of ability ensures inclusive progress.

**Key vocabulary:** run, jump, throw, catch, balance, agility, co-ordination, hop, skip, leap, underarm, overarm, receive, travel, direction, pace

#### PE-KS1-C005 — Physical Health and Fitness
Type: knowledge | Complexity: 1 | Teaching weight: 1

Physical education makes a critical contribution to pupils' physical health and wellbeing by developing the habit of regular physical activity and an understanding of its effects on the body. At KS1, pupils begin to understand the relationship between physical activity and health, noticing how their bodies change during exercise and beginning to understand why physical activity is important for overall health and wellbeing. This lays the foundation for the more detailed understanding of fitness and health developed at KS2 and beyond.

**Teaching guidance:** Build awareness of physical changes during exercise: breathing rate, heart rate, temperature, tiredness. Discuss why physical activity is good for bodies: strength, flexibility, stamina, heart health. Use simple warm-up and cool-down routines to develop understanding of preparation for and recovery from physical activity. Make connections to healthy lifestyle habits: sleep, nutrition and physical activity as interconnected. Keep the emphasis on enjoyment of physical activity so that positive associations are established early.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may equate physical activity with formal sport or competition, missing the broad range of physical activities that contribute to health. Teaching that walking, playing and dancing all count helps broaden pupils' concept of physical activity. Some pupils may have negative associations with physical exertion; connecting physical sensations to positive outcomes (feeling energised, improving at a skill) helps develop positive relationships with physical effort.

**Key vocabulary:** healthy, exercise, fitness, heart rate, breathing, warm up, cool down, strength, stamina, flexibility, energy, active, wellbeing, body

Concepts: PE-KS1-C001 (Fundamental Movement Skills), PE-KS1-C005 (Physical Health and Fitness)
Rationale: Fundamental Movement Skills (C001) and Physical Health and Fitness (C005) are naturally co-taught at KS1: movement skill activities are the primary vehicle through which pupils develop health and fitness understanding — noticing changes in heart rate, breathing and energy during physical activity. Separating them would artificially divide what is experienced as unified physical education.

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**PE-KS1-D001-CL001:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Fundamental movement skills are body structures (running patterns, jumping mechanics, throwing technique) whose correct form determines their function — efficient, safe and powerful movement; even KS1 pupils notice that how you do something changes what you can do.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Physical Health and Fitness (C005) is taught through noticing bodily cause-and-effect relationships — changes in heart rate, breathing and energy during physical activity — making this a first introduction to the body as a responsive physical system.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

### Objectives (1)

## Domain: PE-KS1-D002 — Games and Team Activities
**Subject:** Physical Education | **Key Stage:** KS1 | **Age:** 5-7 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
Team games introduce pupils to the social and strategic dimensions of physical activity at KS1. Pupils not only participate in games but are expected to develop simple tactics for attacking and defending, which requires them to think about the game strategically as well as execute physical skills. This domain develops communication, cooperation and decision-making within physical contexts, teaching pupils to work effectively with others towards shared goals. The introduction of attacking and defending as conceptual frameworks gives pupils a vocabulary for thinking about game strategy that will be extended and refined throughout their physical education.

### Concepts (1)

#### PE-KS1-C002 — Game Tactics and Strategy
Type: skill | Complexity: 1 | Teaching weight: 1

Tactics in games involve making decisions about what to do and when, in order to gain advantage over opponents or to create scoring opportunities. At KS1, pupils develop simple tactical understanding within small-sided games, learning the basic concepts of attacking (trying to score or gain advantage) and defending (trying to prevent the opposition from scoring). Tactical thinking requires pupils to read the game situation, make decisions quickly and adapt their movement accordingly.

**Teaching guidance:** Use small-sided games with simple rules so that tactical decisions are visible and manageable. Start with one-versus-one situations to make attacking and defending clear. Ask pupils questions during and after games: 'What did you do to get past your opponent?' 'Where was the best place to move to?' Use freeze-frame moments to discuss tactical options. Gradually increase the complexity of games as pupils develop tactical understanding. Connect tactical language to real decisions in game contexts rather than teaching it abstractly.

**Common misconceptions:** Young pupils often focus on the ball and chase it regardless of position, making games chaotic. Teaching about space - both finding and creating it - develops more sophisticated game play. Pupils may not understand the value of passing; small games where passing is rewarded help develop this understanding. Some pupils confuse individual skill with team success; cooperative games build understanding that effective teamwork can outperform individual talent.

**Key vocabulary:** attack, defend, score, opponent, team, tactics, strategy, space, position, pass, intercept, guard, mark, goal, target

**PE-KS1-D002-CL001:**
- **Systems and System Models** (primary): What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?
  Why: Even simple team games are systems in which attacking and defending roles interact dynamically — understanding that your team's movement changes the space available to the opposition is a first encounter with systems thinking in a physical context.
  AI instruction: Use the SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS lens: prompt pupils to map the parts of a system and their connections, identify inputs and outputs, trace feedback loops, and predict what happens when one component changes. Useful questions: 'What are all the parts?', 'How does A affect B?', 'What would happen if this part was removed?', 'Where are the boundaries of this system?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Tactical decision-making at KS1 is fundamentally about cause and effect: if I pass here, what happens? If they move left, what space opens? Pupils learn to anticipate consequential chains of action and response.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

## Domain: PE-KS1-D003 — Dance
**Subject:** Physical Education | **Key Stage:** KS1 | **Age:** 5-7 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
Dance at KS1 introduces pupils to the expressive and aesthetic dimensions of physical education, connecting movement to music, rhythm and creative expression. Pupils perform dances using simple movement patterns, which develops their ability to reproduce sequences of movement from memory, to coordinate their body to musical rhythms, and to use their body as a means of creative and expressive communication. Dance develops spatial awareness, body coordination and musicality alongside physical fitness, and provides an important counterpoint to games and athletics in the physical education curriculum. The requirement to use simple movement patterns ensures that dance work is accessible and achievable at this stage while still developing genuine physical and expressive skill.

### Concepts (1)

#### PE-KS1-C003 — Expressive Movement and Dance
Type: skill | Complexity: 1 | Teaching weight: 1 | Fan-out: 1

Dance in physical education develops pupils' ability to use their bodies expressively to communicate ideas, stories, moods and characters through movement. At KS1, pupils work with simple movement patterns, developing the ability to remember and reproduce sequences of movement, to coordinate their movement to music and rhythm, and to use their bodies with creative intention. Dance develops body awareness, spatial awareness, coordination and musicality alongside physical fitness.

**Teaching guidance:** Use a variety of stimuli for dance: music, stories, natural phenomena (weather, animals), themes and emotions. Teach specific movement vocabulary: stretching, curling, twisting, turning, travelling, jumping, stillness. Build simple sequences by combining a small number of actions. Use mirroring and copying activities to develop movement observation and reproduction. Encourage pupils to explore and choose their own movement responses within structured frameworks. Perform to each other to develop confidence and the experience of communicating through movement.

**Common misconceptions:** Some pupils (particularly boys) may resist dance activities. Framing dance as physical skill development and using stimuli with broad appeal addresses this cultural barrier. Pupils may believe there is one correct way to move; open-ended tasks that reward diverse responses develop creative confidence. Pupils may focus on steps rather than expression; teaching that dance communicates something develops more intentional and expressive performance.

**Key vocabulary:** movement, pattern, sequence, expression, rhythm, travel, jump, turn, gesture, stillness, shape, level, direction, body part, tempo

**PE-KS1-D003-CL001:**
- **Patterns** (primary): What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?
  Why: KS1 dance is built on movement patterns — sequences reproduced from memory, repeated rhythmic motifs, mirroring — making pattern recognition and replication the central physical and cognitive demand.
  AI instruction: Use the PATTERNS lens: prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next. Useful questions: 'What do you notice?', 'Does this always happen?', 'What would you expect next?', 'Can you sort these by...?'
- **Structure and Function**: How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Performing movement expressively requires pupils to understand that how a movement is performed (its quality, size, direction) changes what it communicates — the body's structural choices serve expressive functions.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'

## Domain: PE-KS1-D004 — Swimming and Water Safety
**Subject:** Physical Education | **Key Stage:** KS1 | **Age:** 5-7 | **Structure:** process

### Curriculum Context
The National Curriculum requires that all pupils should be able to swim competently by the end of KS2, and schools may choose to teach swimming during KS1 to meet this requirement. The programme of study specifies three specific outcomes: swimming at least 25 metres using a range of strokes; using backstroke, breaststroke and front crawl; and performing safe self-rescue in different water-based situations. The inclusion of water safety as a distinct outcome, alongside swimming competence, reflects the life-critical nature of this skill: pupils are not merely developing a sport but acquiring an essential safety skill. Schools that cannot deliver swimming at KS1 must ensure it is delivered at KS2 so that the requirement is met before the end of primary education.

### Concepts (1)

#### PE-KS1-C004 — Swimming Competence and Water Safety
Type: skill | Complexity: 1 | Teaching weight: 1

Swimming competence combines the technical skills of using different swimming strokes with the physical confidence and stamina to swim a sustained distance. Water safety is distinct from swimming skill: it involves the knowledge and physical capability to survive in water in unexpected situations, including the ability to float on one's back and to tread water. At KS1/KS2, pupils develop both swimming skill and water safety awareness as complementary aspects of aquatic competence.

**Teaching guidance:** Develop water confidence before stroke technique by using games, floats and supported activity in shallow water. Introduce front crawl, backstroke and breaststroke systematically with clear technique points. Build up distance gradually, initially with floats and then independently. Teach floating and trebling water as explicit water safety skills, distinct from stroke swimming. Discuss scenarios where water safety matters - falling into a river, being in choppy seas - to give context to self-rescue skills. Ensure all pupils have equal access to swimming regardless of cultural or language barriers.

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils and parents may not understand why all three strokes are required; explaining that different strokes are used in different conditions and that versatility is the goal helps. Some pupils may have significant water anxiety; a gradual, supportive approach that builds confidence before technique is essential. The distance of 25 metres can seem arbitrary; explaining that it represents the minimum for safe independent swimming in a pool context helps pupils understand the requirement.

**Key vocabulary:** stroke, front crawl, backstroke, breaststroke, breathe, float, tread water, distance, depth, safety, rescue, pool, technique, kick, pull

### Thinking Lenses
Cognitive framing for each cluster — the primary lens (rank 1) is the recommended framing.

**PE-KS1-D004-CL001:**
- **Structure and Function** (primary): How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?
  Why: Each swimming stroke is a physical structure — a coordinated pattern of body position, arm action and leg kick — whose precise form determines its effectiveness; understanding how technique creates propulsion and reduces drag is a direct structure-function relationship.
  AI instruction: Use the STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION lens: prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are, connect form to purpose, and compare structures that serve the same function differently. Useful questions: 'Why is it shaped like that?', 'What would happen if this part were different?', 'What job does each part do?', 'Can you design something that does the same job a different way?'
- **Cause and Effect**: What caused this to happen, and how do we know?
  Why: Water safety knowledge is grounded in understanding cause-and-effect relationships in aquatic environments — why certain conditions are dangerous, what happens to the body when it fatigues in water, and how specific actions cause or prevent drowning risk.
  AI instruction: Use the CAUSE AND EFFECT lens: prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct 'if… then… because…' explanations, and identify multiple causes. Useful questions: 'What made this happen?', 'How could we test that?', 'Is there another reason?', 'What would happen if we changed...?'

## Learner Profile (KS2, from Y3)

### Content Guidelines
**Reading level:** Most children are independent readers of simple texts. Reading fluency varies widely. Decoding is largely automatic for common words.
**Lexile range:** 150–350
**Flesch-Kincaid grade max:** 2
**Sentence length:** max 14 words, avg 9 words
**Vocabulary level:** curriculum_vocabulary_supported
**Vocabulary notes:** Subject vocabulary with inline glossary support. Abstract concepts grounded in familiar contexts. Similes and comparisons helpful (e.g., 'solid is like a brick').
**Academic vocabulary:** Avoid — use everyday language
**Text-to-speech:** Available on request
**TTS notes:** Available on demand. Recommended for EAL learners and those with reading difficulties.
**Sentence structure:** Simple and compound sentences. One subordinate clause maximum. Fronted adverbials acceptable.
**Number range:** 0–1000, simple fractions

**Agent content instructions:** Use clear, active sentences with one idea per sentence. Subject vocabulary can be used if first introduced with a definition. Avoid passive voice. Metaphors and similes are helpful for abstract science concepts. Questions can require 1–3 word written answers or spoken responses.

### Pedagogy Profile
**Session length:** 12–20 minutes, 4 activities
**Scaffolding level:** moderate_to_high
**Hint tiers:** max 3
**Hint notes:** Tier 1: 'What do you already know about this?' Tier 2: 'Remember when we learned [related concept]?' Tier 3: 'The first step is to [specific procedure]...'
**Worked examples:** Required (Text + diagram narrated. Step-by-step with child input at key points ('What would you do next?').)
**Productive failure:** Appropriate
**PF notes:** Introduce challenge problem first; expect partial or incorrect attempts. Move to worked example after child has made one or more attempts. Effect size d=0.36–0.58 (Sinha & Kapur 2021).
**Prerequisite gating:** Required
**Metacognitive prompts:** Not yet appropriate
**Mastery threshold:** 5 correct in 7 days (80%)
**Spacing:** Yes (2–7 day intervals)
**Interleaving:** Appropriate

**Agent pedagogy instructions:** Start with a challenge problem — do not explain first. Let the child attempt independently for 2–3 minutes. Collect their attempt. Then show the worked example. Follow with 3–4 retrieval practice questions that mix this concept with previously mastered material (interleaving). Contextualize difficulty: 'That one was harder — your brain was working to connect different ideas.'

### Feedback Profile
**AI tone:** warm_competence_focused
**Voice style:** Warm but more precise. Name the skill. Begin moving toward academic language.
**Feedback style:** specific_competence
**Immediate feedback:** Yes
**Normalise struggle:** Yes
**Positive error framing:** Yes
**Post-error approach:** Explain the specific error and model the correct reasoning: 'You got 7×8=54, but the correct answer is 56. If you know 7×7=49, then 7 more gives 56.'
**Counter misconceptions explicitly:** Not yet
**Metacognitive reflection:** Not yet
**Metacognitive examples:** []
**Gamification safety:** gamification unsafe, no progress bars, no leaderboards, no visible streaks
**Surprise/delight:** Yes (semi_random). Less frequent than Y1–Y2. Unexpected surprise moments only.
**Example feedback (correct):** "You spotted the pattern — all the multiples of 6 end in an even number. That is a really useful thing to notice."
**Example feedback (incorrect):** "That one got you — 7×8 trips up a lot of people. Here is a trick: 7×7 is 49, so 7×8 is just 7 more, which gives 56."
**Avoid phrases:** ["Wrong", "Incorrect", "You need to improve", "Well done!", "Amazing!"]

**Agent feedback instructions:** Specific competence feedback: name the pattern, rule, or skill the child demonstrated. On error, explain the specific misconception (not just 'wrong') and give the reasoning to fix it. Normalize productive struggle: 'That one took longer — your brain was making new connections.' Never compare to other children or previous performance.

### Interaction Types (15 total, 6 primary)

**Primary (recommended for this year group):**
- **Drag to Categorise** (manipulation, touch_or_mouse): Drag items into labelled category buckets. Used for classification tasks across subjects.
- **Matching Pairs** (manipulation, touch_or_mouse): Draw connections between matching items in two columns (term/definition, cause/effect, word/image).
- **Multiple Choice — 3 Options** (selection, tap): Choose 1 from 3 options. Standard format for Y1 onwards. Options can mix text and illustration.
- **Multiple Choice — 4 Options** (selection, tap_or_click): Standard 4-option multiple choice. The default format for Y4 onwards. Distractors should represent genuine misconceptions.
- **Pattern Discovery — I Notice / I Wonder** (higher_order, tap_or_keyboard): Open-ended discovery mode where child clicks 'I notice...' or 'I wonder...' buttons to record observations before instruction. Used to activate prior knowledge in productive failure sequences.
- **Text Input — Single Word** (text_input, keyboard): Type or speak a single-word answer. Suitable from Y3 where keyboard proficiency is emerging.

**Secondary (available but not primary):**
- Area Model (Grid / Array for Multiplication) (maths_tool, touch_or_mouse): Visual grid model for multiplication and expanded notation. Used to develop understanding of distributive property before formal algorithm.
- Column Subtraction (Formal Written Method with Exchanging) (maths_tool, keyboard): Formal column subtraction with exchange (borrowing). Step-validated digit entry with visual exchange animation.
- Drag and Drop — Place on Target (manipulation, touch_or_mouse): Drag objects to a target location (e.g., place the number on the number line, sort animals into habitats). Fundamental interaction from Y1.
- Fraction Visualiser (Bar / Pizza / Set Model) (maths_tool, touch_or_mouse): Interactive visual model for fractions. Switch between bar model, pizza model, and set (counters) model. Child manipulates to explore equivalence and comparison.
- Image Annotation — Tap to Label (manipulation, tap_or_click): Tap regions on an image (diagram, map, organism) to label them from a provided list or freetext. Used from Y2 for science diagrams and geography maps.
- Number Line — Drag Marker (maths_tool, touch_or_mouse): Drag a marker along a number line to indicate a value or position. Used for estimation, ordering, fraction placement, negative numbers.
- Place Value Blocks (Dienes / Base-10) (maths_tool, touch_or_mouse): Manipulate virtual Base-10 (Dienes) blocks: unit cubes, tens rods, hundreds flats. Used for place value, addition, subtraction, and exchange concepts.
- Voice Input (input, voice): Child speaks their answer; transcribed by AI. Essential for pre-readers and emerging readers. Always available as fallback regardless of year group.
- Voice Recorder — Record and Playback (input, voice): Record a spoken explanation or observation response. Plays back with waveform visualization and automatic transcription. Used for science observations, oral explanations, and hypothesis recording from Y2 onwards. Bridges the gap between oral capability and written production.

### Pedagogy Techniques (2)

**Interleaved Practice** **[NEW this year]**
Mixing different types of problems or concepts within a session rather than blocked practice (all of one type, then all of another). Interleaving requires the learner to identify the problem type before solving — this discrimination step is the source of its effect.
Evidence: Bjork 2011, Rohrer & Taylor 2007, Rohrer et al. 2015. Effect size d=0.42 over blocked practice. Transfer advantage approximately 30-40% on delayed tests.
Implementation: Mix the current concept with 2-3 previously mastered concepts in the retrieval practice phase of a session. Tell the child: 'You are practising different types of problems — that is what makes you better.' Surface features vary; underlying structure is the same.

**Spaced Practice**
Distributing practice over time rather than massing it in a single session. Creates desirable difficulty through time-based forgetting and subsequent retrieval. The gap between practice sessions is the mechanism — not re-studying, but retrieving after a delay.
Evidence: Ebbinghaus 1885, Cepeda et al. 2006 (meta-analysis, n=317 studies). Effect size d=0.46. Optimal spacing interval increases as retention target increases.
Implementation: Return to a previously taught concept after a gap of 1-21 days (gap increases as mastery grows). Do not re-teach — retrieve only. The system selects spacing interval based on days since last correct response.
