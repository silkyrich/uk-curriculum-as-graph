## Week 1: Foundations — Sounds, Letters, and Stories

**Core text**: *Handa's Surprise* by Eileen Browne (read-aloud across the week)

### Lesson 1: What is a Phoneme?

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | EN-KS1-C001 (Phoneme), EN-KS1-C020 (Discussing texts) |
| **Cluster ref** | EN-KS1-D002-CL001, EN-KS1-D003-CL001 |
| **Objective** | Children can identify individual phonemes in spoken words; children can share responses to a story read aloud |
| **Key vocabulary** | phoneme, sound, listen, hear, word; discuss, share, think |
| **Structure** | **Phonics (15 min)**: Introduce "phoneme" — a sound, not a letter. Oral phoneme counting: clap each sound in CVC words (cat = 3, ship = 3 not 4). Address schwa misconception immediately: model pure /s/, /t/, /p/ — no "suh", "tuh", "puh". Phoneme finger count game. **Shared reading (15 min)**: Read *Handa's Surprise* aloud. Pause at cover — discuss title and illustration. After reading: "What did you notice? What did you like?" Establish turn-taking for book discussions. |

### Lesson 2: What is a Grapheme?

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | EN-KS1-C002 (Grapheme), EN-KS1-C018 (Story structure), EN-KS1-C020 (Discussing texts) |
| **Cluster ref** | EN-KS1-D002-CL001, EN-KS1-D003-CL001 |
| **Objective** | Children understand that a grapheme is a letter or group of letters that represents one phoneme; children can identify the beginning, middle, and end of a familiar story |
| **Key vocabulary** | grapheme, letter, digraph, write, spell; beginning, middle, end, character, setting |
| **Structure** | **Phonics (15 min)**: Introduce "grapheme" — the written representation of a phoneme. Flashcard review: show grapheme → children say phoneme. Single letters first (s, a, t, p, i, n). Then demonstrate digraphs: "sh" is ONE grapheme, TWO letters, ONE sound. Grapheme/phoneme matching game on carpet. **Shared reading (15 min)**: Reread *Handa's Surprise*. Introduce story mountain display. Together identify: beginning (Handa packs fruit), middle (animals take fruit), end (surprise). Children retell in pairs. |

### Lesson 3: Grapheme-Phoneme Correspondences

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | EN-KS1-C003 (GPC), EN-KS1-C004 (Blending), EN-KS1-C005 (Segmenting), EN-KS1-C017 (Making connections) |
| **Cluster ref** | EN-KS1-D002-CL001, EN-KS1-D003-CL001 |
| **Objective** | Children understand that specific graphemes correspond to specific phonemes; children begin to blend CVC words; children can connect a story to their own experience |
| **Key vocabulary** | GPC, alphabetic code, match, blend, push together, segment, chop up; connect, remind, similar |
| **Structure** | **Phonics (20 min)**: "Graphemes and phonemes are partners — the alphabetic code." Speed sounds review: flash graphemes for s, a, t, p, i, n, m, d — children say phonemes. Introduce blending: model with "sat" — point to each grapheme, say each phoneme, sweep finger under and blend. Children practise on whiteboards: sat, tap, pin, man. Then introduce segmenting as the reverse: "I say the word, you chop it up." Oral segmenting of same words using phoneme frames. **Shared reading (10 min)**: Revisit *Handa's Surprise*. "Has anything like this happened to you? Have you ever had a surprise?" Pairs share connections. Teacher models: "This reminds me of when..." |

### Lesson 4: Blending and Segmenting CVC Words

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | EN-KS1-C004 (Blending), EN-KS1-C005 (Segmenting), EN-KS1-C016 (Retrieval) |
| **Cluster ref** | EN-KS1-D002-CL001, EN-KS1-D003-CL001 |
| **Objective** | Children can blend and segment CVC words independently; children can find explicit information in a familiar text |
| **Key vocabulary** | blend, segment, CVC, sound out, read, write; find, where, show me, text |
| **Structure** | **Phonics (15 min)**: Blend to read, segment to spell — paired activities. Reading: children use sound buttons (dots under each grapheme) to blend CVC words on cards: dog, cat, sit, mop, pen, big. Spelling: teacher says word, children segment orally then write on whiteboard. 10 words. Address misconception: some children will say sounds but not merge them — model the "push together" motion. **Shared reading (15 min)**: Read a new short text (non-fiction: simple page about fruit, linking to Handa). Introduce retrieval: "Can you find where it tells us what colour the mango is?" Children point to text. Practise three retrieval questions. Establish: "The answer is IN the text — find it and point." |

### Lesson 5: Practising the Code — Review and Assess

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | EN-KS1-C001 (Phoneme), EN-KS1-C002 (Grapheme), EN-KS1-C003 (GPC), EN-KS1-C004 (Blending), EN-KS1-C005 (Segmenting), EN-KS1-C019 (Vocabulary development) |
| **Cluster ref** | EN-KS1-D002-CL001, EN-KS1-D003-CL001 |
| **Objective** | Children can demonstrate Phase 3 GPC knowledge; children can discuss word meanings |
| **Key vocabulary** | All phonics vocabulary from week; meaning, new word, what does it mean |
| **Structure** | **Phonics (15 min)**: Speed sounds assessment — flashcard run through all Phase 3 single-letter GPCs. Note children who hesitate or error for intervention grouping. Blending race: children read 10 CVC words against the timer. Segmenting check: dictate 5 CVC words for children to write on whiteboards. **Shared reading (15 min)**: Reread *Handa's Surprise*. Focus on vocabulary: "tangerine", "passion fruit", "avocado". What do these words mean? Have you eaten any of these? New words for our word wall. Model: "I don't know what 'avocado' means — let me look at the picture for a clue." |

---

## Week 2: Building the Code — Blending Fluency and Comprehension Routines

**Core text**: *The Enormous Turnip* (traditional tale)

### Lesson 6: Blending with Adjacent Consonants

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | EN-KS1-C004 (Blending), EN-KS1-C005 (Segmenting), EN-KS1-C018 (Story structure) |
| **Cluster ref** | EN-KS1-D002-CL001, EN-KS1-D003-CL001 |
| **Objective** | Children can blend CCVC and CVCC words; children can retell a story using story structure vocabulary |
| **Key vocabulary** | blend, consonant cluster, CCVC, CVCC; retell, beginning, middle, end, problem |
| **Structure** | **Phonics (15 min)**: Progress from CVC to CCVC (stop, frog, clap) and CVCC (milk, help, just). Model blending with sound buttons — line under digraphs where needed. Children blend on whiteboards, then segment: teacher says "stop", children write. **Shared reading (15 min)**: Read *The Enormous Turnip*. After reading, use story map template: Who? (old man) Where? (garden) Problem? (turnip too big) Ending? (everyone pulls together). Children draw their own simple story map in pairs. |

### Lesson 7: GPC Fluency and Prediction

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | EN-KS1-C003 (GPC), EN-KS1-C014 (Prediction), EN-KS1-C020 (Discussing texts) |
| **Cluster ref** | EN-KS1-D002-CL001, EN-KS1-D003-CL001 |
| **Objective** | Children respond rapidly to GPC flashcards; children can make predictions based on text and picture clues |
| **Key vocabulary** | speed, quick, automatic; predict, think, what next, clue, because |
| **Structure** | **Phonics (15 min)**: Speed sounds challenge — aim for all Phase 3 GPCs in under 2 minutes as a class. Introduce "tricky" GPCs where one grapheme can make different sounds (c in cat vs city — flag but don't labour). Blending practice with decodable sentences. **Shared reading (15 min)**: Reread *The Enormous Turnip*. Pause before the climax. "Who do you think will come next? What makes you think that?" Establish prediction rule: "I think ___ because ___." Discuss: were our predictions right? Predictions aren't right or wrong — they should have REASONS. |

### Lesson 8: Common Exception Words — First Set

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | EN-KS1-C008 (Common exception words), EN-KS1-C004 (Blending), EN-KS1-C023 (Sequencing events) |

| **Objective** | Children can read 5 common exception words (the, I, no, go, to); children can sequence events from a story |
| **Key vocabulary** | exception word, tricky word, tricky part; first, then, next, finally, order, sequence |
| **Structure** | **Phonics (15 min)**: Introduce "tricky words" — words where phonics doesn't fully work. Show "the" — which part IS decodable? (/th/ is!) Which part is tricky? (the 'e' doesn't say /e/). Mark the tricky part in each word with a dot. Teach: the, I, no, go, to. Flashcard drill. Read decodable sentences containing these words. **Shared reading (15 min)**: Give groups 4 picture cards from *The Enormous Turnip*. Sequence them: first, then, next, finally. Children use time connectives to retell in order. Address misconception: include one distractor card (not from the story) — can they spot it? |

### Lesson 9: Blending and Segmenting Consolidation

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | EN-KS1-C004 (Blending), EN-KS1-C005 (Segmenting), EN-KS1-C006 (Decoding), EN-KS1-C022 (Literary language patterns) |
| **Cluster ref** | EN-KS1-D002-CL001, EN-KS1-D003-CL003 |
| **Objective** | Children decode unfamiliar CVC/CCVC words in a decodable text; children recognise repeated phrases in a story |
| **Key vocabulary** | decode, sound out, unfamiliar, try; pattern, repeated, refrain, story language |
| **Structure** | **Phonics (15 min)**: First decodable reader session. Children read a book matched to Phase 3 GPCs (e.g., Little Wandle Book Band). Model the decoding process: look at word, find graphemes, say phonemes, blend. Children read with partners. Teacher circulates and listens. **Shared reading (15 min)**: Reread *The Enormous Turnip*. Focus on literary language: "And they pulled, and they pulled, and they pulled." What phrases are repeated? Why does the author repeat them? Can we join in? Introduce "refrain." Compare with "We're Going on a Bear Hunt" pattern. |

### Lesson 10: Exception Words and Vocabulary

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | EN-KS1-C008 (Common exception words), EN-KS1-C019 (Vocabulary development), EN-KS1-C016 (Retrieval) |
| **Cluster ref** | EN-KS1-D002-CL001, EN-KS1-D003-CL001 |
| **Objective** | Children can read and spell 5 exception words; children can discuss the meaning of unfamiliar words using context clues |
| **Key vocabulary** | tricky word, read, spell, remember; meaning, context, clue, picture, what does it mean |
| **Structure** | **Phonics (15 min)**: Review Week 1 exception words (the, I, no, go, to). Add new set: he, she, we, me, be. Find the decodable parts. Dictation: children write all 10 exception words from memory. Cheer the "tricky parts." **Shared reading (15 min)**: Read a non-fiction text about gardens/growing (linking to Turnip theme). Encounter unfamiliar words: "enormous", "vegetable", "harvest." Model vocabulary strategy: read around the word, look at the picture, think what makes sense. Add to class word wall. Retrieval questions: "What did the book say you need to grow a plant?" |

## Week 3: Digraphs Begin — Consonant Digraphs and Deeper Comprehension

**Core text**: *Each Peach Pear Plum* by Janet and Allan Ahlberg

### Lesson 11: Consonant Digraphs — sh, ch

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | EN-KS1-C010 (Consonant digraphs), EN-KS1-C002 (Grapheme), EN-KS1-C021 (Reciting poetry) |
| **Cluster ref** | EN-KS1-D002-CL003, EN-KS1-D003-CL003 |
| **Objective** | Children can read and write words containing sh and ch; children can learn and recite a short poem |
| **Key vocabulary** | consonant digraph, sh, ch, two letters, one sound; poem, rhyme, rhythm, recite, by heart |
| **Structure** | **Phonics (15 min)**: Review — "A digraph is ONE grapheme made of TWO letters making ONE sound." Teach sh (ship, fish, shell) and ch (chip, chop, rich). Emphasise: don't say /s/ /h/ — it's one sound /sh/. Use action cues (finger to lips for sh, mime chewing for ch). Blending practice with sh/ch words. Segmenting: dictate ship, chat, much. **Shared reading (15 min)**: Read *Each Peach Pear Plum*. It's a rhyming text — discuss rhyme and rhythm. Learn first verse by heart as a class. Perform together with actions. Poetry is meant to be SAID, not just read. Children recite in pairs. |

### Lesson 12: Consonant Digraphs — th, ng

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | EN-KS1-C010 (Consonant digraphs), EN-KS1-C005 (Segmenting), EN-KS1-C014 (Prediction) |
| **Cluster ref** | EN-KS1-D002-CL003, EN-KS1-D003-CL001 |
| **Objective** | Children can read and write words with th and ng; children make text-based predictions |
| **Key vocabulary** | th (voiced/unvoiced), ng, digraph; predict, I think... because..., evidence |
| **Structure** | **Phonics (15 min)**: Teach th — two pronunciations! Voiced: this, that, then. Unvoiced: thin, thick, think. Hand on throat to feel the difference. Teach ng — only at end of words: ring, song, king. Note misconception: children may try /n/ /g/ instead of /ng/. Blending and segmenting practice with all four consonant digraphs. **Shared reading (15 min)**: Continue *Each Peach Pear Plum*. Each page has a hidden character — predict: "I spy with my little eye... Who do you think is hiding? What makes you think that?" Children use picture clues and text pattern to predict. Revisit predictions after turning the page. |

### Lesson 13: Reading with Digraphs and Self-Correction

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | EN-KS1-C006 (Decoding), EN-KS1-C010 (Consonant digraphs), EN-KS1-C024 (Self-correction while reading) |
| **Cluster ref** | EN-KS1-D002-CL003, EN-KS1-D003-CL005 |
| **Objective** | Children decode words with digraphs in connected text; children begin to self-correct when reading doesn't make sense |
| **Key vocabulary** | decode, digraph, blend; check, reread, does it make sense, try again |
| **Structure** | **Phonics (15 min)**: Decodable reader containing sh, ch, th, ng words. Before reading: spot the digraphs on the page (circle them). Then read. When a child misreads, model self-correction: "Hmm, I read 'sit' but the word has 'sh' — let me try again — 'ship.' Does that make sense?" Teach the three checks: Does it LOOK right? Does it SOUND right? Does it MAKE SENSE? **Shared reading (15 min)**: Model self-correction during shared reading. Deliberately misread a word: "The old woman baked a cake and — wait, I read 'baked' but this word is 'packed'. Let me check — does 'packed' make sense here?" Children practise: spot the teacher's deliberate mistakes. |

### Lesson 14: Exception Words Set 3 and Making Connections

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | EN-KS1-C008 (Common exception words), EN-KS1-C017 (Making connections), EN-KS1-C019 (Vocabulary development) |
| **Cluster ref** | EN-KS1-D002-CL003, EN-KS1-D003-CL001 |
| **Objective** | Children read and spell 5 more exception words; children make relevant connections between text and experience |
| **Key vocabulary** | tricky word, remember, spell; connect, remind, same as, different from |
| **Structure** | **Phonics (15 min)**: Review all 10 exception words from Weeks 1-2. Add new set: was, his, has, you, they. Find decodable parts — "was" has /w/ and /z/ sound, "his" has /h/ and /z/. Flashcard drill: aim for automatic recognition. Sentence reading with exception words embedded. **Shared reading (15 min)**: Finish *Each Peach Pear Plum*. "Which character reminds you of someone? Which story does this book remind you of?" Model a relevant connection (not tangential). Vocabulary: "I spy", "plum", "cellar" — what do these mean? Children share connections in pairs, then class discussion. |

### Lesson 15: Formative Assessment — Mid-Term Check

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | EN-KS1-C001-C005 (Phonics foundations), EN-KS1-C008, C010 (Exception words, Digraphs), EN-KS1-C016 (Retrieval), EN-KS1-C018 (Story structure) |
| **Cluster ref** | Assessment — all clusters to date |
| **Objective** | Assess phonics knowledge (Phase 3 GPCs, digraphs, CVC/CCVC blending, CVC segmenting); assess comprehension (retrieval, story retelling) |
| **Key vocabulary** | All taught vocabulary to date |
| **Structure** | **Phonics assessment (15 min)**: Individual speed sounds check (all Phase 3 GPCs + sh, ch, th, ng). Blend 10 words (mix of CVC and CCVC with digraphs). Write 5 dictated words. Read 10 exception words. Teacher records on assessment grid. **Comprehension assessment (15 min)**: Retell *Each Peach Pear Plum* or *The Enormous Turnip* using story structure vocabulary. 3 retrieval questions on a short shared text. Children who finish early: draw and label their favourite character (vocabulary application). **Outcome**: Identify children for phonics intervention, guided reading groupings, exception word booster groups. |

## Week 4: Vowel Digraphs and Expanding Comprehension

**Core text**: *Lost and Found* by Oliver Jeffers

### Lesson 16: Vowel Digraphs — ai, ee

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | EN-KS1-C009 (Vowel digraphs), EN-KS1-C003 (GPC), EN-KS1-C018 (Story structure) |
| **Cluster ref** | EN-KS1-D002-CL003, EN-KS1-D003-CL001 |
| **Objective** | Children can read and write words with ai and ee; children apply story structure knowledge to a new text |
| **Key vocabulary** | vowel digraph, ai, ee, long vowel; character, setting, problem, resolution |
| **Structure** | **Phonics (15 min)**: "We know consonant digraphs — now vowel digraphs. Same rule: two letters, one sound, but now with vowels." Teach ai (rain, tail, paint) with picture/word cards. Teach ee (tree, feet, sleep). Blending practice. Segmenting: dictate rain, feet, train, sleep. Misconception alert: children may try /a/ /i/ — reinforce "one sound." **Shared reading (15 min)**: Read *Lost and Found*. First reading — just enjoy the story. After: identify story structure. Who? (boy and penguin) Problem? (penguin is lost — or is he?) Setting? (boy's house, the sea, South Pole). "Is this a happy ending? How do you know?" |

### Lesson 17: Vowel Digraphs — oa, oo

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | EN-KS1-C009 (Vowel digraphs), EN-KS1-C004 (Blending), EN-KS1-C015 (Inference) |
| **Cluster ref** | EN-KS1-D002-CL003, EN-KS1-D003-CL006 |
| **Objective** | Children can read and write words with oa and oo; children begin to make simple inferences from pictures and text |
| **Key vocabulary** | oa, oo, vowel digraph; infer, feel, think, why, because, clue |
| **Structure** | **Phonics (15 min)**: Teach oa (boat, coat, road) and oo — two pronunciations! Long oo (moon, food, cool) and short oo (book, look, cook). This is the first alternative pronunciation for one grapheme — flag it: "The same grapheme can make different sounds." Blending and segmenting practice. **Shared reading (15 min)**: Reread *Lost and Found*. Focus on key illustrations. "Look at the boy's face here — how is he feeling? How do you know?" Model inference: "I think he looks sad because his mouth is turned down and the penguin has gone. The text doesn't SAY he's sad, but I can work it out." Introduce "I think... because..." for inference. |

### Lesson 18: Applying Vowel Digraphs in Reading

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | EN-KS1-C006 (Decoding), EN-KS1-C009 (Vowel digraphs), EN-KS1-C024 (Self-correction while reading) |
| **Cluster ref** | EN-KS1-D002-CL003, EN-KS1-D003-CL005 |
| **Objective** | Children decode words with vowel digraphs in connected text; children self-correct using meaning and phonics |
| **Key vocabulary** | decode, vowel digraph, blend, check; self-correct, does it make sense, reread |
| **Structure** | **Phonics (15 min)**: Decodable reader containing ai, ee, oa, oo words. Pre-reading: scan pages for vowel digraphs and underline them. Read with partners. Teacher listens to focus group. Prompt self-correction: "You read 'bot' — look again, there's a vowel digraph. What sound does 'oa' make? Try again." **Shared reading (15 min)**: Partner reading of a simpler text. One child reads, one checks: "Did that make sense?" Practise the self-correction routine with actual reading, not just teacher modelling. Children swap roles after one page. |

### Lesson 19: Exception Words Set 4 and Vocabulary Deep Dive

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | EN-KS1-C008 (Common exception words), EN-KS1-C007 (Automatic word recognition), EN-KS1-C019 (Vocabulary development) |
| **Cluster ref** | EN-KS1-D002-CL003, EN-KS1-D003-CL003 |
| **Objective** | Children read 20 exception words with increasing automaticity; children explain the meaning of unfamiliar words |
| **Key vocabulary** | tricky word, automatic, quick, sight word; meaning, explain, describe, synonym |
| **Structure** | **Phonics (15 min)**: Review all 15 exception words. Add: my, by, your, are, all. Speed challenge: how many can we read in 30 seconds? Note which words children now recognise automatically (C007 developing). Dictation: write 5 exception words in sentences. **Shared reading (15 min)**: Reread *Lost and Found* focusing on Jeffers' vocabulary choices: "devoted", "South Pole", "horizon", "arrived." For each word: What could it mean? Look at the picture. Read around the word. Does our guess make sense? Add to word wall with child-friendly definitions. |

### Lesson 20: Digraph Review and Literary Language

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | EN-KS1-C009 (Vowel digraphs), EN-KS1-C010 (Consonant digraphs), EN-KS1-C022 (Literary language patterns), EN-KS1-C021 (Reciting poetry) |
| **Cluster ref** | EN-KS1-D002-CL003, EN-KS1-D003-CL003 |
| **Objective** | Children read words containing all taught digraphs; children recognise and use literary language patterns |
| **Key vocabulary** | digraph, vowel, consonant, blend; pattern, story language, once upon a time, refrain |
| **Structure** | **Phonics (15 min)**: Digraph sorting activity: cards with words — sort into consonant digraphs (sh, ch, th, ng) and vowel digraphs (ai, ee, oa, oo). Then blend and read each sorted pile. Segmenting challenge: dictate 6 words containing mixed digraphs. **Shared reading (15 min)**: Read a traditional tale (e.g., *The Three Billy Goats Gruff*). Identify "story language": "Once upon a time", "Trip trap, trip trap", "Who's that trip-trapping over my bridge?" How is this different from how we talk normally? Learn and perform the "trip trap" refrain together. Link to *Each Peach Pear Plum* patterns from Week 3. Learn a short action rhyme by heart (C021). |

## Week 5: Split Digraph, Syllables, and Growing Independence

**Core text**: *Owl Babies* by Martin Waddell

### Lesson 21: Split Digraph — a-e, i-e

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | EN-KS1-C011 (Split digraph), EN-KS1-C003 (GPC), EN-KS1-C014 (Prediction) |
| **Cluster ref** | EN-KS1-D002-CL004, EN-KS1-D003-CL005 |
| **Objective** | Children understand the split digraph pattern; children can read a-e and i-e words; children make predictions about a new text |
| **Key vocabulary** | split digraph, a-e, i-e, bossy e, long vowel; predict, cover, title, I think... because... |
| **Structure** | **Phonics (15 min)**: "This is a special kind of digraph — the two letters that work together are SPLIT apart." Show word pairs: cap → cape, tap → tape, kit → kite, bit → bite. "The 'e' at the end changes the vowel sound. The vowel says its NAME." Use phoneme frames with split digraph marked as one unit. Blending practice. Misconception: "magic e" suggests randomness — explain the pattern is SYSTEMATIC. **Shared reading (15 min)**: Show cover of *Owl Babies*. "What do you think this story will be about? How do you think the owls are feeling? What might happen?" Collect predictions on the board. Read the first half. Check predictions. Make new ones for the second half. |

### Lesson 22: Split Digraph — o-e, u-e, e-e

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | EN-KS1-C011 (Split digraph), EN-KS1-C006 (Decoding), EN-KS1-C015 (Inference) |
| **Cluster ref** | EN-KS1-D002-CL004, EN-KS1-D003-CL006 |
| **Objective** | Children read and write words with all five split digraph patterns; children infer characters' feelings |
| **Key vocabulary** | o-e, u-e, e-e, split digraph, decode; infer, feel, think, why, character, emotion |
| **Structure** | **Phonics (15 min)**: Extend split digraph: hop → hope, tub → tube, pet → Pete. Practise all five patterns. Read split digraph words in sentences. Segmenting: dictate made, time, bone, cute. Watch for misconception: children applying split digraph to words like "have", "come", "give" — explain these are exception words where the rule doesn't apply. **Shared reading (15 min)**: Finish *Owl Babies*. Inference focus: "How does Bill feel when Mummy isn't there? How do you know? The words say 'I want my mummy' — what does that tell us about how he feels? Is he just saying it or really feeling it?" "How do Sarah and Percy feel? Are they feeling the same as Bill?" Deeper inference using character comparison. |

### Lesson 23: Syllables — Breaking Up Longer Words

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | EN-KS1-C012 (Syllables), EN-KS1-C004 (Blending), EN-KS1-C023 (Sequencing events) |
| **Cluster ref** | EN-KS1-D002-CL006, EN-KS1-D003-CL005 |
| **Objective** | Children can clap and count syllables; children can use syllable knowledge to read two-syllable words; children can sequence story events |
| **Key vocabulary** | syllable, beat, clap, vowel, multi-syllable, break up; sequence, first, then, next, finally |
| **Structure** | **Phonics (15 min)**: "Every syllable has a vowel sound. Let's clap the beats." Start with names: Sam (1), Emily (3), Jonathan (3). Then common words: cat-er-pil-lar, bed-room, rain-bow. Reading strategy for longer words: break into syllables, blend each syllable, then put together. Practise with: sunset, picnic, bobbin, children. Misconception: clapping letters not beats — demonstrate the difference. **Shared reading (15 min)**: Retell *Owl Babies* using sequencing. Give each table a set of event cards. Order them: first (Mummy leaves), then (owls wake up), next (they worry), after that (they sit on Bill's branch), finally (Mummy comes home). Use time connectives to retell aloud. |

### Lesson 24: Decoding with All Taught GPCs

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | EN-KS1-C006 (Decoding), EN-KS1-C011 (Split digraph), EN-KS1-C012 (Syllables), EN-KS1-C020 (Discussing texts) |
| **Cluster ref** | EN-KS1-D002-CL006, EN-KS1-D003-CL006 |
| **Objective** | Children decode words containing all taught GPCs in connected text; children discuss a text with peers, sharing opinions |
| **Key vocabulary** | decode, blend, digraph, split digraph, syllable; discuss, opinion, favourite, agree, disagree |
| **Structure** | **Phonics (15 min)**: Decodable reader matched to Phase 5a — containing consonant digraphs, vowel digraphs, and split digraph. Pre-reading: preview tricky words. Children read independently (teacher with guided group). Focus on decoding strategy: find the graphemes, say the phonemes, blend. For two-syllable words: break into syllables first. **Shared reading (15 min)**: Book discussion — "Which of our stories this half-term has been your favourite? Why?" Model a book discussion using talking stems: "I liked ___ because ___", "I agree with ___ because ___", "I think ___ but ___." Every child contributes to partner talk. Pairs share with table group. |

### Lesson 25: Fluency Building and Poetry Performance

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | EN-KS1-C013 (Reading fluency), EN-KS1-C006 (Decoding), EN-KS1-C021 (Reciting poetry), EN-KS1-C022 (Literary language patterns) |
| **Cluster ref** | EN-KS1-D002-CL006, EN-KS1-D003-CL003 |
| **Objective** | Children reread a familiar decodable text fluently; children perform a poem from memory with expression |
| **Key vocabulary** | fluency, expression, pace, smooth, phrasing; poem, perform, recite, by heart, expression |
| **Structure** | **Phonics (15 min)**: Fluency focus — reread the decodable book from Lesson 24. First read: accuracy. Second read: pace (no long pauses between words). Third read: expression (change voice for character speech). Model reading in "chunks" not word-by-word. Misconception: fast ≠ fluent. Pace should match meaning. **Shared reading (15 min)**: Poetry performance! Children recite the poem learned in Week 3 (from Lesson 11) plus the new one from Week 4. Perform in small groups with actions, expression, and appropriate volume. Discuss: "How does the poet's choice of words make you feel? What pictures do the words create in your head?" (Literary language, C022.) |

## Week 6: Consolidation, Fluency, and Assessment

**Core text**: *We're Going on a Bear Hunt* by Michael Rosen (plus review of all half-term texts)

### Lesson 26: All GPCs Review — Reading and Spelling

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | EN-KS1-C003 (GPC), EN-KS1-C006 (Decoding), EN-KS1-C005 (Segmenting), EN-KS1-C008 (Common exception words) |
| **Cluster ref** | EN-KS1-D002-CL008 (Consolidation) |
| **Objective** | Children read and spell words using all Autumn 1 GPCs; children read all 20 exception words automatically |
| **Key vocabulary** | All phonics vocabulary; automatic, fluent, decode, segment, exception word |
| **Structure** | **Phonics (20 min)**: Grand review. Speed sounds: all Phase 3 GPCs + consonant digraphs + vowel digraphs + split digraph. Blending challenge: 20 words of increasing difficulty (CVC → CCVC → digraph words → split digraph → two-syllable). Segmenting dictation: 10 words covering all taught patterns. Exception word speed drill: target is all 20 in under 1 minute as a class. **Shared reading (10 min)**: Read *We're Going on a Bear Hunt*. Enjoy the text — join in with refrains. This is a celebration of reading. |

### Lesson 27: Fluency and Comprehension Consolidation

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | EN-KS1-C013 (Reading fluency), EN-KS1-C007 (Automatic word recognition), EN-KS1-C015 (Inference), EN-KS1-C016 (Retrieval) |
| **Cluster ref** | EN-KS1-D002-CL008, EN-KS1-D003-CL008 (Consolidation) |
| **Objective** | Children read a decodable text fluently and answer comprehension questions |
| **Key vocabulary** | fluent, expression, smooth; retrieve, infer, find, think, because |
| **Structure** | **Phonics (15 min)**: Fluency session — children read a new decodable text (not seen before). First read: decode accurately. Second read: build fluency. Third read: add expression. Teacher takes running records for two focus children. Note words read automatically (C007 check). **Shared reading (15 min)**: Reread *We're Going on a Bear Hunt*. Mix of retrieval and inference: "What did they go through first?" (retrieval) "How do you think they felt in the snowstorm? How do you know?" (inference) "Why did they run all the way home?" (inference — connecting fear to action). |

### Lesson 28: Self-Correction and Independence

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | EN-KS1-C024 (Self-correction while reading), EN-KS1-C006 (Decoding), EN-KS1-C013 (Reading fluency), EN-KS1-C017 (Making connections) |
| **Cluster ref** | EN-KS1-D002-CL008, EN-KS1-D003-CL008 (Consolidation) |
| **Objective** | Children self-correct independently using phonics and meaning; children make connections across texts read this half-term |
| **Key vocabulary** | self-correct, check, reread, does it make sense; connect, compare, same, different, remind |
| **Structure** | **Phonics (15 min)**: Independent decodable reading. Focus children: teacher observes and notes self-correction behaviours. Does the child: stop when it doesn't make sense? Reread? Try again? Use phonics to fix errors? Or read on regardless? Prompt where needed: "Did that make sense? What could you try?" **Shared reading (15 min)**: "We've read so many books this half-term! Let's connect them." Display all book covers. "How are *Owl Babies* and *Lost and Found* similar?" (both about being lost/separated). "How are *The Enormous Turnip* and *Bear Hunt* similar?" (both have repeated patterns). "Which story is most like something that's happened to you?" Cross-text connections. |

### Lesson 29: Summative Assessment — Word Reading

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | EN-KS1-C001-C013 (All Word Reading concepts) |
| **Cluster ref** | Assessment — full domain |
| **Objective** | Formally assess phonics knowledge, decoding ability, exception word reading, and emerging fluency |
| **Key vocabulary** | All phonics vocabulary |
| **Structure** | **Full lesson assessment (30 min)**: Station rotation while teacher assesses individuals. **Station 1 (teacher)**: 1-to-1 phonics check. Speed sounds (all GPCs). Read 15 words (real and pseudo-words, PSC practice). Read 10 exception words. Read a short decodable passage — note accuracy, fluency, self-correction. **Station 2 (TA)**: Independent phonics practice — word building with magnetic letters, digraph sorting. **Station 3**: Partner decodable reading. **Station 4**: Exception word spelling practice. Teacher records: GPC knowledge %, blending accuracy, exception word recognition, fluency rating (1-3). |

### Lesson 30: Summative Assessment — Comprehension + Half-Term Celebration

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | EN-KS1-C014-C024 (All Comprehension concepts) |
| **Cluster ref** | Assessment — full domain |
| **Objective** | Assess comprehension skills (retrieval, prediction, inference, sequencing); celebrate half-term reading |
| **Key vocabulary** | All comprehension vocabulary |
| **Structure** | **Comprehension assessment (20 min)**: Teacher reads a short, unfamiliar picture book aloud. Children answer questions (orally in guided groups or with pictorial response sheets): 1. Retrieval: "What colour was the ___?" (C016) 2. Prediction: pause mid-story — "What do you think will happen?" (C014) 3. Inference: "How does ___ feel? How do you know?" (C015) 4. Sequencing: order 4 picture cards from the story (C023) 5. Vocabulary: "What does ___ mean?" (C019) **Celebration (10 min)**: Children choose their favourite book from the half-term and share why they love it with their partner (C020 — discussing texts). Award "reading certificates" for effort and progress. Preview Autumn 2 — "Next half-term we'll read even more amazing stories and learn more sounds!" |
