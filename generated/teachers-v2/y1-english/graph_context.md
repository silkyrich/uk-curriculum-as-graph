## Domain: Reading - Word Reading (EN-KS1-D002)

- **Subject**: English
- **Year**: Y1
- **Structure type**: sequential

**Curriculum context**: Reading — word reading at KS1 focuses on teaching children the alphabetic code systematically through phonics, enabling them to decode unfamiliar words independently. Children learn the correspondences between sounds (phonemes) and letters or groups of letters (graphemes), applying this knowledge to blend sounds in order to read words and segment words for spelling. The statutory curriculum requires that by the end of Year 1, children pass the statutory Phonics Screening Check, demonstrating sec

#### EN-KS1-C001: Phoneme

**Description**: The smallest unit of sound in spoken language (e.g., /c/ /a/ /t/)

**Teaching guidance**: Teach phonemes through a systematic synthetic phonics programme (e.g., Letters and Sounds, Read Write Inc.). Begin with single-letter phonemes (/s/, /a/, /t/, /p/) before progressing to digraphs and trigraphs. Use oral segmenting games — say a word slowly and ask children to count the sounds on their fingers. Ensure children understand that a phoneme is a sound, not a letter, by demonstrating words where one sound is represented by more than one letter.

**Key vocabulary**: phoneme, sound, letter, mouth, listen, say, hear, word

**Common misconceptions**: Children often confuse phonemes with letters, believing that each letter always makes one sound. They may count letters rather than sounds when segmenting (e.g., thinking 'ship' has four sounds instead of three). Some children add a schwa sound to consonant phonemes (e.g., saying 'buh' instead of /b/).


#### EN-KS1-C002: Grapheme

**Description**: A letter or group of letters representing a phoneme (e.g., 'sh', 'ch', 'igh')

**Teaching guidance**: Introduce graphemes alongside phonemes from the start of systematic phonics teaching. Use flashcards showing the grapheme with a picture cue (e.g., 'sh' with a picture of a ship). Teach children that a grapheme can be one letter (s), two letters (sh, ch, th), or three letters (igh, ear). Practise matching graphemes to phonemes using phoneme frames and magnetic letters. Display grapheme charts in the classroom for reference.

**Key vocabulary**: grapheme, letter, digraph, trigraph, sound, write, spell, read

**Common misconceptions**: Children may think that every letter is a separate grapheme, leading them to split digraphs incorrectly when reading (e.g., reading 'sh' as /s/ /h/). They may struggle to understand that the same phoneme can be represented by different graphemes (e.g., /ee/ can be 'ee', 'ea', 'e-e').


#### EN-KS1-C003: Grapheme-Phoneme Correspondence (GPC)

**Description**: The relationship between letters and the sounds they represent

**Teaching guidance**: Teach GPCs in a systematic order following the school's chosen phonics programme. Start with one-to-one correspondences (one letter, one sound) before introducing alternatives. Use a 'speed sounds' routine where children see the grapheme and say the phoneme rapidly. Revisit GPCs daily through flashcard practice. When children encounter a new GPC in reading, explicitly name it and add it to the class phonics display.

**Key vocabulary**: grapheme-phoneme correspondence, sound, letter, match, phonics, code, alphabetic code

**Common misconceptions**: Children often assume each letter makes only one sound and become confused when they encounter alternative pronunciations (e.g., 'c' in cat vs city). They may not realise that English has more phonemes (approximately 44) than letters (26), requiring some sounds to be represented by letter combinations.


#### EN-KS1-C004: Blending

**Description**: Merging individual phonemes together to read whole words

**Teaching guidance**: Model blending explicitly by pointing to each grapheme in a word, saying each phoneme, then sweeping a finger under the word while merging the sounds together. Use 'sound buttons' (dots under single graphemes, lines under digraphs) to support segmenting before blending. Start with CVC words (cat, sit, mop) and progress to CCVC (stop, frog) and CVCC (milk, help). Practise blending daily using decodable books matched to the GPCs taught so far.

**Key vocabulary**: blend, sound out, push together, read, phoneme, word, CVC, say the sounds

**Common misconceptions**: Children may say the individual phonemes correctly but fail to merge them into a recognisable word — they 'bark at print' without synthesising. Some children blend only the first two sounds and then guess the rest of the word from context or pictures. Others segment but cannot hold all the sounds in memory long enough to blend.


#### EN-KS1-C005: Segmenting

**Description**: Breaking spoken words into individual phonemes for spelling

**Teaching guidance**: Teach segmenting as the reverse of blending — hearing a whole word and breaking it into its component phonemes. Use phoneme frames (Elkonin boxes) where children push a counter into each box as they say each sound. Practise with oral segmenting before writing: say a word, ask children to identify each sound, then write the corresponding grapheme for each. Progress from CVC words to longer words with adjacent consonants and digraphs.

**Key vocabulary**: segment, sound out, chop up, phoneme, spell, write, phoneme frame, count the sounds

**Common misconceptions**: Children often miss sounds in consonant clusters (writing 'sop' for 'stop') because adjacent consonants are harder to hear separately. They may segment by letter name rather than by sound, or struggle to identify the phonemes in words containing digraphs (e.g., treating 'ch' in 'chip' as two separate sounds).


#### EN-KS1-C006: Decoding

**Description**: Using phonic knowledge to read unfamiliar words

**Teaching guidance**: Ensure children apply their phonic knowledge to read unfamiliar words rather than guessing from pictures or context. Model the decoding process explicitly: look at the word, identify the graphemes, say each phoneme, blend them together. Use decodable books that match the GPCs children have been taught. When a child encounters an unfamiliar word, prompt them to 'sound it out' rather than telling them the word. Gradually introduce words with more complex graphemes as phonic knowledge develops.

**Key vocabulary**: decode, sound out, blend, read, phonics, unfamiliar word, try, grapheme

**Common misconceptions**: Children may over-rely on picture cues or initial letter guessing instead of decoding the whole word. Some children decode accurately but too slowly to retain meaning. Others apply decoding to common exception words that cannot be fully decoded phonically, leading to mispronunciation.


#### EN-KS1-C007: Automatic word recognition

**Description**: Reading familiar words without conscious decoding

**Teaching guidance**: Build automatic word recognition through repeated exposure to high-frequency words in reading and writing. Use flashcard drills for rapid recognition of common words. Ensure children read decodable texts frequently so that regularly encountered words become automatic. Practise reading common exception words until they are recognised instantly. The goal is to free cognitive resources for comprehension by making word-level reading effortless.

**Key vocabulary**: sight word, recognise, read quickly, automatic, fluent, high-frequency word, know by sight

**Common misconceptions**: Children may believe that automatic recognition means memorising words as whole shapes rather than understanding their phonemic structure. Some children develop automatic recognition of a limited set of words but continue to guess at unfamiliar words rather than decoding them. Teachers sometimes prioritise sight word memorisation over phonic decoding, which limits long-term reading independence.


#### EN-KS1-C008: Common exception words

**Description**: High-frequency words with unusual spelling patterns that must be learned

**Teaching guidance**: Teach common exception words (e.g., the, said, was, where, there, one, once) explicitly, drawing attention to the 'tricky' part of each word that does not follow regular phonics rules. Use a 'tricky word' wall and practise reading and spelling these words daily. Highlight which parts of the word are decodable and which must be learned by heart. Statutory exception words for Year 1 and Year 2 are listed in Appendix 1 of the National Curriculum.

**Key vocabulary**: exception word, tricky word, tricky part, high-frequency word, learn, remember, spell, read

**Common misconceptions**: Children may try to decode exception words fully using phonics rules and produce incorrect pronunciations (e.g., reading 'said' as /s-ay-d/). They may assume all high-frequency words are exception words, when in fact many common words are fully decodable. Some children learn to read exception words but cannot spell them, as reading recognition and spelling recall are different processes.


#### EN-KS1-C009: Vowel digraphs

**Description**: Two vowels together making one sound (e.g., 'ai', 'ee', 'oa')

**Teaching guidance**: Teach vowel digraphs systematically within the phonics programme. Introduce each digraph with a key word and picture (e.g., 'ai' — rain, 'ee' — tree, 'oa' — boat, 'oo' — moon/book). Use phoneme frames to show that a digraph represents one phoneme, not two. Practise reading and spelling words containing each digraph. Teach alternative spellings for the same vowel phoneme (e.g., the /ee/ sound can be spelt 'ee', 'ea', 'e-e', 'ie', 'ey').

**Key vocabulary**: vowel digraph, two letters, one sound, ai, ee, oa, oo, ou, ow, long vowel

**Common misconceptions**: Children often try to sound out each letter in a digraph separately (e.g., reading 'oa' as /o/ /a/ instead of /oa/). They may confuse digraphs that look similar (e.g., 'ou' and 'ow', or 'ai' and 'ia'). Some children do not realise that the same vowel sound can have multiple spelling representations.


#### EN-KS1-C010: Consonant digraphs

**Description**: Two consonants together making one sound (e.g., 'sh', 'ch', 'th')

**Teaching guidance**: Teach consonant digraphs (sh, ch, th, ng, wh, ck) early in the phonics programme, as they appear in many common words. Use picture cues and actions (e.g., finger to lips for 'sh'). Emphasise that two letters together make one new sound — it is not a blend of the two letter sounds. Teach the two pronunciations of 'th' (voiced as in 'this' and unvoiced as in 'thin'). Practise reading and writing words with consonant digraphs in initial and final positions.

**Key vocabulary**: consonant digraph, sh, ch, th, ng, ck, wh, two letters, one sound

**Common misconceptions**: Children commonly attempt to say each letter's individual sound rather than the digraph sound (e.g., /s/ /h/ instead of /sh/). They may confuse 'ch' and 'sh' or struggle to distinguish the voiced and unvoiced 'th' sounds. Some children find 'ng' particularly difficult because it never appears at the start of English words.


#### EN-KS1-C011: Split digraph

**Description**: Two letters separated by another letter making one sound (e.g., 'a-e' in 'make')

**Teaching guidance**: Teach the split digraph pattern (a-e, e-e, i-e, o-e, u-e) by showing how the 'e' at the end of a word changes the vowel sound from short to long. Use word pairs to demonstrate the pattern (e.g., cap/cape, hop/hope, kit/kite, tub/tube). Explain that the two letters work together even though they are separated by a consonant — the 'e' is not silent but does a job of making the vowel say its name. Use phoneme frames with the split digraph marked as one unit.

**Key vocabulary**: split digraph, magic e, a-e, i-e, o-e, u-e, e-e, long vowel, bossy e

**Common misconceptions**: Children often think the final 'e' makes its own sound rather than modifying the preceding vowel. They may apply the split digraph rule to words where it does not apply (e.g., 'have', 'come', 'give'). The term 'magic e' can create a misconception that the 'e' appears randomly rather than being a systematic spelling pattern.


#### EN-KS1-C012: Syllables

**Description**: Beats or units of sound within words

**Teaching guidance**: Teach syllables by clapping or tapping the beats in spoken words before connecting to reading and spelling. Use children's names as starting points (e.g., 'Sam' = 1 syllable, 'Emily' = 3 syllables). Explain that every syllable must contain a vowel sound. Use syllable segmenting as a strategy for reading and spelling longer words — break the word into syllables, read or spell each syllable, then put them back together.

**Key vocabulary**: syllable, beat, clap, vowel, part of a word, break up, multi-syllable

**Common misconceptions**: Children sometimes confuse syllables with phonemes, thinking each sound is a syllable. They may miscount syllables in words with adjacent vowels (e.g., thinking 'lion' has one syllable) or with silent 'e' endings (e.g., counting 'cake' as two syllables). Some children tap letters rather than beats when asked to count syllables.


#### EN-KS1-C013: Reading fluency

**Description**: Reading accurately and at a good pace with expression

**Teaching guidance**: Develop reading fluency through regular practice reading familiar texts and rereading decodable books. Model fluent reading aloud daily, demonstrating appropriate pace, expression and phrasing. Use paired reading where a fluent reader (adult or peer) reads alongside the child. Teach children to read in 'chunks' or phrases rather than word by word. Once children can decode accurately, shift attention to pace and prosody through repeated readings of the same short text.

**Key vocabulary**: fluency, expression, pace, smooth, read aloud, practise, phrasing, intonation

**Common misconceptions**: Children may equate fast reading with fluent reading, reading rapidly without attention to meaning or expression. Some children read accurately but in a monotone, word-by-word manner. Others develop fluency with familiar texts but lose it completely when encountering new material, suggesting that decoding has not yet become fully automatic.

- **Year**: Y1
- **Structure type**: developmental

**Curriculum context**: Reading comprehension at KS1 develops pupils' ability to understand and interpret what they read — both words on the page and the deeper meanings, themes and ideas that texts contain. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to listen to and discuss a wide range of texts including stories, poetry and non-fiction, developing their pleasure in reading and their ability to predict what might happen, discuss the significance of the title and events, make inferences based on what they have read, and

#### EN-KS1-C014: Prediction

**Description**: Using clues from text and pictures to anticipate what might happen next

**Teaching guidance**: Teach prediction as an active reading strategy by modelling it during shared reading. Before reading, ask children to look at the cover, title and illustrations and say what they think the book will be about. During reading, pause at key moments and ask 'What do you think will happen next? What makes you think that?' Encourage children to use clues from the text and pictures to support their predictions. After reading, revisit predictions to confirm or revise them.

**Key vocabulary**: predict, guess, think, what next, clue, expect, because, I think

**Common misconceptions**: Children often make wild guesses unconnected to the text rather than using evidence from what they have read or seen. Some children are reluctant to predict because they fear being wrong — emphasise that predictions are not right or wrong but should be supported by evidence. Others make predictions but do not revisit them to check against what actually happens.


#### EN-KS1-C015: Inference

**Description**: Reading between the lines to understand what is implied but not stated

**Teaching guidance**: Introduce inference at KS1 through picture books and illustrations, asking 'How do you think this character is feeling? How do you know?' Model the thinking process: 'The picture shows tears on her face and she is looking down, so I think she feels sad.' Use stories with clear emotional content. Ask questions that require children to think beyond the literal text, such as 'Why did the character do that?' Teach children to use the phrase 'I think... because...' to justify inferences.

**Key vocabulary**: inference, clue, think, feel, because, why, work out, between the lines

**Common misconceptions**: Young children often state what is explicitly shown rather than inferring meaning (e.g., 'She is crying' rather than 'She is sad because she lost her toy'). They may project their own feelings onto characters without evidence from the text. Some children do not understand the difference between what the text says and what it implies.


#### EN-KS1-C016: Retrieval

**Description**: Finding and extracting explicit information from text

**Teaching guidance**: Teach retrieval by modelling how to find specific information in a text. Start with simple questions where the answer is stated explicitly (e.g., 'What colour was the dog?'). Teach children to scan the text to find the relevant part rather than rereading the entire text. Use shared reading to practise pointing to where in the text the answer can be found. Progress from finding single facts to finding and combining information from different parts of a short text.

**Key vocabulary**: find, look for, where does it say, answer, information, text, point to, show me

**Common misconceptions**: Children often answer retrieval questions from memory or general knowledge rather than checking the text. They may give the answer to a different question because they have not read the question carefully. Some children answer with a whole sentence copied from the text when a specific detail is required.


#### EN-KS1-C017: Making connections to own experience

**Description**: Linking what is read to personal knowledge and experiences

**Teaching guidance**: Encourage children to make personal connections to texts during shared and guided reading. Ask questions like 'Has anything like this ever happened to you?' or 'Does this remind you of another story you know?' Model making connections yourself: 'This reminds me of when I...' Ensure connections are relevant to the text and support comprehension rather than being purely anecdotal. Use texts that reflect children's real-life experiences to build this skill.

**Key vocabulary**: connect, remind, similar, like, experience, same as, different from, relate

**Common misconceptions**: Children sometimes share personal anecdotes that are tangential to the text rather than genuine connections that deepen understanding. They may make connections only to their own experience and not to other texts or wider knowledge. Some children struggle to explain how their connection helps them understand the text better.


#### EN-KS1-C018: Story structure

**Description**: Understanding narrative elements: beginning, middle, end, characters, setting, events

**Teaching guidance**: Teach story structure using simple frameworks: beginning (who, where), middle (what happens, the problem) and end (how it is resolved). Use story maps and story mountains as visual scaffolds. Retell familiar stories together, identifying the key structural elements. During shared reading, pause to discuss where the story is in its structure. Use traditional tales with clear, repetitive structures as models before introducing more complex narratives.

**Key vocabulary**: beginning, middle, end, character, setting, problem, resolution, story, what happens

**Common misconceptions**: Children often think a story's beginning is just the first sentence, rather than the section that introduces characters and setting. They may confuse story events with story structure, listing 'then... then... then...' without identifying the key turning point or problem. Some children assume all stories follow the same structure.


#### EN-KS1-C019: Vocabulary development

**Description**: Learning and using new words in context

**Teaching guidance**: Develop vocabulary through read-alouds, explicitly teaching 2-3 new words per text. When encountering unfamiliar words, use the context and illustrations to discuss meaning. Create a class 'word wall' or 'word of the day' display. Encourage children to use new words in their own speech and writing. Teach simple strategies for working out word meanings: look at the picture, read around the word, think about what would make sense.

**Key vocabulary**: word, meaning, new word, what does it mean, vocabulary, synonym, describe, interesting word

**Common misconceptions**: Children may assume they cannot understand a text if they encounter an unfamiliar word, rather than using context to work out its meaning. They may use familiar words to define new words inaccurately (e.g., saying 'enormous' means 'big' without understanding the degree). Some children passively skip unfamiliar words without noticing them.


#### EN-KS1-C020: Discussing texts

**Description**: Talking about books with others, sharing opinions and understanding

**Teaching guidance**: Create regular opportunities for structured discussion about books during shared reading, guided reading and class story time. Use open-ended questions that invite discussion rather than single-word answers: 'What did you think about...?' 'Why do you think the author chose...?' Model turn-taking and active listening in book discussions. Encourage children to respond to each other's ideas, not just the teacher. Use partner talk ('turn and tell your partner...') to ensure all children participate.

**Key vocabulary**: discuss, talk about, share, opinion, think, agree, disagree, favourite, because

**Common misconceptions**: Children may retell the plot rather than discussing their response to it. They may give one-word answers rather than explaining their thinking. Some children dominate discussions while others are reluctant to contribute — structured pair and group talk helps ensure all voices are heard.


#### EN-KS1-C021: Reciting poetry

**Description**: Learning and performing poems by heart with expression

**Teaching guidance**: Teach a range of poems by heart across KS1, beginning with simple nursery rhymes and action rhymes in Year 1 and progressing to poems with more complex patterns and vocabulary in Year 2. Use performance techniques — clapping rhythms, adding actions, varying volume and pace. Recite poems together as a class before asking individuals to perform. Choose poems with strong rhythm and rhyme to support memorisation, and discuss how the poet's word choices create effects.

**Key vocabulary**: poem, rhyme, rhythm, verse, line, perform, recite, by heart, learn, poet

**Common misconceptions**: Children sometimes think poetry must rhyme, limiting their appreciation of free verse. They may memorise words without understanding meaning, reciting mechanically without expression. Some children confuse reciting a poem with reading it aloud from a page.


#### EN-KS1-C022: Literary language patterns

**Description**: Recognizing repetitive phrases, rhyme, and patterned language in stories and poems

**Teaching guidance**: Draw attention to repeated language patterns, refrains, and literary language during shared reading of stories and poems. Use texts with predictable patterns (e.g., 'We're Going on a Bear Hunt', 'Each Peach Pear Plum') so children can join in and internalise the structures. Discuss how authors use language differently from everyday speech — 'Once upon a time', 'happily ever after', repeated phrases and refrains. Encourage children to use literary language patterns in their own storytelling and writing.

**Key vocabulary**: pattern, repeated, refrain, once upon a time, rhyme, rhythm, story language, phrase

**Common misconceptions**: Children may not distinguish between everyday language and literary language, using conversational register in story writing. They may think 'story language' means using complicated words rather than recognising specific structural and formulaic features. Some children learn formulaic openings and endings but struggle to use patterned language within the body of their writing.


#### EN-KS1-C023: Sequencing events

**Description**: Ordering story events in chronological order

**Teaching guidance**: Teach sequencing through retelling stories in the correct order using visual supports such as picture cards, story maps and sequencing strips. Begin with stories that have a clear chronological structure. Ask children to identify 'What happened first? Then what? What happened at the end?' Use time connectives (first, then, next, after that, finally) to support oral and written sequencing. Practise sequencing events from children's own experiences before applying to texts.

**Key vocabulary**: first, then, next, after, finally, order, sequence, beginning, middle, end, what happened

**Common misconceptions**: Children often include excessive detail about one event while omitting others, resulting in unbalanced retellings. They may confuse the order of events, particularly in stories with flashbacks or parallel narratives. Some children struggle to distinguish between important plot events and minor details when sequencing.


#### EN-KS1-C024: Self-correction while reading

**Description**: Noticing and correcting reading errors to maintain meaning

**Teaching guidance**: Teach children to monitor their own reading by noticing when something does not make sense. Model this during shared reading: 'That didn't sound right — let me go back and try again.' Encourage children to reread sentences that do not make sense, checking the sounds, the meaning and the grammar. Teach the three checking strategies: Does it look right? Does it sound right? Does it make sense? Praise children who self-correct rather than reading on regardless.

**Key vocabulary**: check, reread, try again, make sense, correct, does it look right, does it sound right

**Common misconceptions**: Children may read through errors without noticing because they are focused solely on decoding individual words rather than constructing meaning. Some children stop at an error but wait for an adult to correct them rather than attempting self-correction. Others correct pronunciation but do not reconsider meaning.
