**Teacher**: Miss Thornton (NQT+1)
**Year Group**: Year 1
**Half-Term**: Autumn 1 (6 weeks, 30 lessons)
**Focus**: Word Reading (EN-KS1-D002) and Comprehension (EN-KS1-D003)

## Initial Reaction to the Cluster Scaffold

Right, I've just spent an hour going through the graph data and my first reaction is: this is genuinely useful as a starting skeleton, but the algorithm doesn't know what a Year 1 classroom actually looks like on a Monday morning in September.

The good bits first. The **concept inventory** is bang on. Thirteen Word Reading concepts and eleven Comprehension concepts captures everything I need for this half-term. The prerequisite chains are solid too — Phoneme and Grapheme feeding into Blending (EN-KS1-C004), GPC and Blending feeding into Decoding (EN-KS1-C006), Decoding feeding into Fluency (EN-KS1-C013). That's textbook synthetic phonics progression and I'd draw it the same way on a whiteboard.

The **teaching guidance and misconception notes** are excellent. I've printed out the concept cards and I'll stick them in my planning folder. The note about children adding schwa to consonant phonemes (C001 misconceptions) is something I see every single day — "buh" instead of /b/. Having that flagged in the data means I'll address it explicitly from Lesson 1.

But the cluster sequence? That's where I start disagreeing with the algorithm.

### What the Algorithm Got Wrong

**Problem 1: Segmenting is buried in Cluster 6.**

The algorithm places Segmenting (EN-KS1-C005) in the sixth cluster (EN-KS1-D002-CL006), after all the digraphs, exception words, and even split digraph. In reality, segmenting is the *mirror* of blending. You blend to read, you segment to spell. I teach them side by side from the very first week. Every phonics lesson in my classroom follows: teach the GPC, blend words with it (reading), then segment words with it (spelling). They're reciprocal. The prerequisite chain actually shows this — both Blending and Segmenting depend on Phoneme (C001) — but the clustering algorithm has inexplicably split them apart by about four weeks.

I'm moving Segmenting into Week 1 alongside Blending. Non-negotiable.

**Problem 2: Consonant digraphs and vowel digraphs are lumped together in one cluster (CL003) with exception words AND automatic word recognition.**

That cluster has four concepts spanning complexity 2-3 with a lesson count of 9. But in a real phonics programme, consonant digraphs (sh, ch, th, ng — EN-KS1-C010) come *before* vowel digraphs (ai, ee, oa — EN-KS1-C009). Children typically meet consonant digraphs in Phase 3 of Letters and Sounds (which most of my children should know from Reception) and then vowel digraphs follow. And automatic word recognition (C007) doesn't get explicitly "taught" in a single block — it develops gradually as decoding becomes fluent. Putting it in a cluster alongside digraphs makes it look like a discrete thing to teach in one lesson, when really it's an emergent property.

**Problem 3: The two domains are treated as completely separate sequences.**

The graph gives me 8 clusters for Word Reading and 8 for Comprehension, running in parallel but never intersecting. In Year 1, these domains are deeply interleaved. My phonics session feeds directly into my shared reading. The child who blends "ship" in phonics at 9:15 is the same child hearing "The Enormous Turnip" at 9:40 and being asked to predict what happens next. Comprehension depends on word reading — the graph knows this (it has cross-domain prerequisites: C013 Reading fluency → C015 Inference; C006 Decoding → C024 Self-correction) — but the cluster sequence doesn't reflect it. I need to weave these together myself.

**Problem 4: Four assessment clusters is too many for a 30-lesson half-term.**

The algorithm generates assessment clusters after every keystone: CL002 and CL007 for Word Reading, CL002 and CL004 for Comprehension. That's four formal assessment points in six weeks, on top of consolidation clusters. For Year 1 Autumn 1, I'd have one formative checkpoint mid-term (end of Week 3) and one summative assessment at the end (Week 6). The rest is ongoing AfL — mini whiteboards, cold calling, running records during guided reading.

### What the Algorithm Got Right

**The prerequisite ordering within Word Reading is correct.** Phoneme → Grapheme → GPC → Blending → Decoding → Fluency. That's the spine of synthetic phonics and the graph has it exactly right.

**The comprehension starting point is good.** Beginning with Retrieval (C016), Story structure (C018), and Making connections (C017) before moving to Prediction, then Inference is developmentally sound. You need to be able to find information in text before you can read between the lines.

**The keystone flags are helpful.** Phoneme, GPC, Segmenting, Decoding, and Reading fluency as keystones in Word Reading — yes, absolutely. Retrieval, Story structure, Vocabulary development, and Discussing texts as keystones in Comprehension — also yes. These are the concepts I'd assess formally.

**The co-teaching signals are genuinely useful.** The link between Grapheme ↔ Vowel digraphs, Grapheme ↔ Consonant digraphs, and Grapheme ↔ Split digraph confirms what I'd do naturally: teach digraphs as extensions of the grapheme concept, not as separate topics. The co-teaching link between Syllables ↔ Blending and Syllables ↔ Segmenting is also spot on — syllable work supports multi-syllable word reading.

---

## Cross-Domain Decisions

This is the heart of my planning challenge. The graph treats Word Reading and Comprehension as two parallel streams. I'm going to merge them into a single integrated sequence because that's how children experience reading.

My structure for each lesson (30 minutes):
- **First 15-20 minutes**: Phonics focus (Word Reading concepts)
- **Last 10-15 minutes**: Shared/guided reading (Comprehension concepts, applied Word Reading)

This means every lesson touches both domains, but I'll tag each lesson with a *primary* concept focus for tracking purposes.

### Key interleaving decisions:

1. **Weeks 1-2**: Phonics foundations (Phoneme, Grapheme, GPC, Blending, Segmenting) paired with Comprehension foundations (Story structure, Making connections, Retrieval, Discussing texts). The comprehension work uses read-alouds — texts I read TO the children, so it's not dependent on their independent reading ability yet.

2. **Weeks 3-4**: Digraphs (Consonant then Vowel) and Common exception words, paired with Prediction, Vocabulary development, and Literary language. I'll use texts that contain the digraphs we're learning so children see phonics in real reading contexts.

3. **Weeks 5-6**: Split digraph, Syllables, Decoding consolidation, and Reading fluency development, paired with Inference, Sequencing, Self-correction, and Reciting poetry. By now children can read more independently, so comprehension work shifts from purely listening to reading-then-comprehending.

The cross-domain prerequisites from the graph confirm this timing:
- Decoding (C006) → Self-correction (C024): I need children to be decoding before they can self-correct, so C024 sits in Week 5. Correct.
- Reading fluency (C013) → Inference (C015): Children need some fluency before they can infer. I've placed inference in Week 5, after fluency work begins in Week 4. This is tight but workable — at this stage, most inference work happens through listening comprehension anyway.

## Specific Grouping Decisions

### Merges (concepts I'll teach together that the algorithm separated)

**Merge 1: Blending (C004) + Segmenting (C005)**
The algorithm puts these in CL001 and CL006 respectively. I'm teaching them together from Day 3. Every phonics lesson: blend to read, segment to spell. The co-teaching signal (Blending ↔ Segmenting: extracted) supports this. The prerequisite chain shows both depend on Phoneme (C001) — they're siblings, not sequential.

**Merge 2: Vocabulary development (C019) + Discussing texts (C020)**
The algorithm places these in different clusters (CL003 and CL006 for Comprehension). In reality, vocabulary work IS discussion. When I read "The Enormous Turnip" and ask "What does 'enormous' mean?" that's vocabulary development (C019) AND discussing texts (C020) simultaneously. I'll introduce both in Week 1 and they'll run throughout.

**Merge 3: Story structure (C018) + Sequencing events (C023)**
The algorithm puts these far apart (CL001 vs CL005 for Comprehension). But sequencing IS story structure in action — beginning, middle, end is the scaffold for sequencing events. I'll introduce story structure in Week 1 and sequencing in Week 2, building directly on the same texts.

### Splits (concepts I'll spread across more lessons than the algorithm suggests)

**Split 1: Decoding (C006) — teaching weight 4**
The algorithm puts this in one cluster (CL006 with 11 lessons shared across 4 concepts). Decoding is the *purpose* of phonics. It's not a single-lesson concept — it's something children do in every phonics session from Week 2 onwards. I'm treating it as a thread that runs through Weeks 2-6, with explicit decoding-focused lessons in Weeks 4-5.

**Split 2: Common exception words (C008) — threaded across Weeks 2-6**
The algorithm puts this in CL003 (one block of practice). In reality, I teach 2-3 new exception words per week on a rolling programme. Week 2: the, I, no, go, to. Week 3: he, she, we, me, be. And so on. These need daily revisiting, not a single block.

**Split 3: Reading fluency (C013) — teaching weight 3**
Like decoding, fluency isn't a one-off lesson. It builds through repeated reading of decodable texts. I'll introduce the concept explicitly in Week 4 and build it through Weeks 5-6, but fluency practice is embedded in every lesson where children read.

### Resequences (concepts I'm moving from the algorithm's position)

**Resequence 1: Consonant digraphs (C010) BEFORE Vowel digraphs (C009)**
The algorithm groups them together (CL003). In phonics programmes, consonant digraphs (sh, ch, th) come first because they're more phonemically transparent — the two letters make a genuinely new sound. Vowel digraphs (ai, ee, oa) come later because they require understanding of long/short vowel distinctions. I'm putting consonant digraphs in Week 3 and vowel digraphs in Week 4.

**Resequence 2: Prediction (C014) moved earlier**
The algorithm places Prediction in CL005 (late in the Comprehension sequence). But prediction is one of the most natural and accessible comprehension skills for five-year-olds. "What do you think will happen next?" is something I do from the first shared reading. I'm introducing it in Week 2 and it'll run throughout.

**Resequence 3: Self-correction (C024) paired with Decoding, not saved until the end**
The graph notes C006 Decoding → C024 Self-correction as a cross-domain prerequisite. The algorithm places Self-correction in CL005 (Week 5 area). I agree it can't come first, but I'll introduce it in Week 3 when children start decoding more independently. The teaching guidance note — "Does it look right? Does it sound right? Does it make sense?" — is a strategy I'll model from the moment children start blending real texts.

## Where I Agreed and Disagreed with the Algorithm

### Agreements (specific)

1. **Starting with Phoneme (C001) and Grapheme (C002)** — CL001's opening pair is exactly right. You must establish the sound-letter distinction before anything else.

2. **GPC (C003) as keystone** — The algorithm flags this as a keystone and places it in the first cluster. Correct. Understanding that letters map to sounds is THE foundational insight.

3. **Inference (C015) near the end** — The Comprehension sequence places Inference in CL006, which is late. This is correct for explicit instruction. Inference is cognitively demanding and requires fluency, vocabulary, and retrieval as foundations. The prerequisite chain (Retrieval → Inference, Vocabulary → Inference, Reading fluency → Inference) is exactly right.

4. **Split digraph (C011) after other digraphs** — CL004/CL005 place split digraph after consonant and vowel digraphs. Yes — split digraph is a conceptual leap (the two letters that work together are *separated* by another letter) and needs the simpler digraph patterns as a foundation.

5. **Comprehension cluster CL001 starting with Retrieval (C016), Making connections (C017), and Story structure (C018)** — These are the right starting concepts. Retrieval is the most concrete comprehension skill, making connections is the most personal, and story structure gives a scaffold for everything else.

### Disagreements (specific)

1. **Segmenting (C005) in Cluster 6** — fundamentally wrong placement. Must be co-taught with Blending from Week 1. (Already discussed above.)

2. **Automatic word recognition (C007) in a practice cluster (CL003)** — This is an emergent skill, not a teachable concept in isolation. I'll track it but not dedicate explicit lessons to it. It develops as decoding becomes automatic through practice.

3. **Four assessment gates in 30 lessons** — Over-assessment. I need two: one formative (Week 3), one summative (Week 6). The rest is embedded AfL.

4. **Lesson count of 11 for CL006 and CL007 (same concepts repeated)** — Inflated. Segmenting, Decoding, Syllables, and Reading fluency don't need 22 lessons between them. The algorithm seems to have over-allocated here because of the high teaching weights.

5. **Vocabulary development (C019) placed mid-sequence in Comprehension** — Vocabulary is a thread from Day 1. Every shared reading teaches vocabulary. The algorithm treats it as a block to introduce after Story structure and Retrieval, but I'm introducing it alongside them.

6. **Reciting poetry (C021) grouped with Vocabulary and Literary language (CL003)** — Partial agreement. These DO connect, but poetry is also physical and performative. I'd give it a dedicated lesson rather than blending it with vocabulary work.

## How the Enrichment Data Helped

### Teaching guidance

The most useful enrichment data across the board. Specific examples:

- **C004 Blending**: "Use 'sound buttons' (dots under single graphemes, lines under digraphs)" — I already use these but I'd forgotten to prepare my sound button mats for September. Now on my resources list.
- **C008 Common exception words**: "Highlight which parts of the word ARE decodable and which must be learned by heart" — This is the approach I use (the "tricky part" method) and it's good to see it in the data. Validates my practice.
- **C018 Story structure**: "Use story maps and story mountains as visual scaffolds" — I'll create a class story mountain display in Week 1.
- **C015 Inference**: "Use the phrase 'I think... because...' to justify inferences" — This is my sentence stem for inference from Week 5. Having it in the data means the platform and I would use consistent language.

### Common misconceptions

These are gold. I've used them to plan specific "pre-emptive strikes" in my lessons:

- **C001 Phoneme**: Children adding schwa to consonants ("buh" for /b/) — I'll model pure sounds from Lesson 1 and correct this explicitly.
- **C003 GPC**: "Children assume each letter makes only one sound" — I'll address this when introducing digraphs. "Remember, sometimes two letters work as a team."
- **C014 Prediction**: "Children make wild guesses unconnected to the text" — I'll establish the rule "predictions must have evidence" from Week 2.
- **C011 Split digraph**: "The term 'magic e' can create a misconception" — Interesting. I've always used "magic e" but the data makes a good point about it suggesting randomness. I'll use "split digraph" and "bossy e" alongside it, and explain the pattern is systematic.

### Key vocabulary

Useful for consistency. The vocabulary lists for each concept give me my word walls. I'll create three displays:
1. Phonics vocabulary (phoneme, grapheme, digraph, blend, segment, decode)
2. Comprehension vocabulary (predict, infer, retrieve, sequence, connect)
3. Literary vocabulary (character, setting, rhyme, rhythm, verse, poem)

### Teaching weight

The weights helped me allocate lesson time:
- C006 Decoding has weight 4 (highest) — confirmed my instinct to thread it through most lessons
- C013 Reading fluency has weight 3 — multiple lessons, building over time
- C001 Phoneme has weight 1 — quick to establish, then embedded in everything else
- Most concepts at weight 2 — standard allocation of 1-2 focused lessons each

## Phonics-Specific Decisions

The graph captures the conceptual structure of phonics well but misses the *progression* within concepts. Here's what I mean:

**Phoneme (C001)** is listed as a single concept, but in practice I teach phonemes in a specific order: s, a, t, p, i, n, m, d, g, o, c, k, ck, e, u, r, h, b, f, ff, l, ll, ss. My children should know most of these from Reception, so Autumn 1 is consolidation, but I need to assess and fill gaps. The graph can't capture this granularity — it's at the concept level, not the phoneme level.

**Grapheme-Phoneme Correspondence (C003)** similarly covers a huge range. There are 44+ phonemes in English, each with multiple possible graphemes. The GPC concept is actually a year-long journey, not a two-lesson topic. For Autumn 1, I'm focusing on:
- Consolidating Phase 3 GPCs (Reception learning)
- Introducing Phase 5a alternative pronunciations (autumn term focus in most programmes)

**The phonics programme question**: The graph is programme-agnostic, which is both a strength and a limitation. My school uses Little Wandle Letters and Sounds Revised. The graph's concept sequence broadly aligns with any SSP programme, but the specific grapheme teaching order comes from Little Wandle, not from the graph. The graph gives me the conceptual skeleton; my phonics programme fills in the muscle and sinew.

**Phonics Screening Check (PSC)**: The graph doesn't mention this statutory assessment (June of Year 1), but it shapes everything I do. Every phonics concept I teach this half-term is building toward children being able to decode 40 real and pseudo-words by June. The graph's emphasis on Decoding (C006, weight 4) and Blending (C004) reflects this implicitly.

**My phonics-specific resequencing**:
1. Week 1: Consolidate Phase 3 — single-letter GPCs, consonant digraphs sh/ch/th/ng (C001, C002, C003, C010). Most children know these; I'm assessing gaps.
2. Week 2: Blending and Segmenting with known GPCs (C004, C005). Practise reading and writing CVC and CCVC words.
3. Week 3: New consonant digraphs and begin vowel digraphs — wh, ck review, then ai, ee, igh (C009, C010 continuation).
4. Week 4: More vowel digraphs — oa, oo, ar, or, ur (C009 continuation). Exception words intensify (C008).
5. Week 5: Split digraph (C011). Syllable work for two-syllable words (C012).
6. Week 6: Decoding consolidation with all taught GPCs (C006). Fluency building (C013).

## Assessment and Consolidation

The algorithm gives me four assessment clusters and two consolidation clusters across the two domains. I'm compressing this to:

### Formative Assessment (Week 3, Lesson 15)
- **Word Reading**: Quick phonics assessment — can children read CVC words with Phase 3 GPCs? Can they blend and segment? Identifies children who need intervention.
- **Comprehension**: Can children retell a familiar story (beginning, middle, end)? Can they retrieve simple information from a text read to them?

Concept IDs assessed: C001, C002, C003, C004, C005, C016, C018

### Summative Assessment (Week 6, Lesson 29-30)
- **Word Reading**: Phonics screening check practice — real words and pseudo-words using all taught GPCs including digraphs and split digraph. Also reading 10 common exception words.
- **Comprehension**: Guided reading assessment — child reads a decodable text and answers retrieval, prediction, and inference questions. Oral retelling with sequencing.

Concept IDs assessed: C003, C006, C008, C009, C010, C011, C013, C014, C015, C016, C023

### Ongoing AfL (every lesson)
- Mini whiteboards for phonics (blend and write)
- Cold calling during shared reading
- Running records during guided reading (1-2 children per day)
- "Tricky word" flashcard speed checks
- Exit tickets: "Tell your partner what happened in the story" (comprehension check)

## Summary of Changes from Algorithm to My Plan

| Algorithm Said | I'm Doing | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Segmenting in CL006 (Week 5+) | Segmenting from Week 1 | Blend and segment are reciprocal skills |
| Consonant + vowel digraphs together | Consonant digraphs first (W3), then vowel (W4) | Phonics progression: consonant digraphs are simpler |
| Automatic word recognition as explicit teaching | Threaded throughout, no dedicated lesson | Emergent skill, not a discrete concept |
| 4 assessment clusters | 2 assessment points (W3 formative, W6 summative) | Less disruption, more teaching time |
| Domains as separate streams | Integrated: phonics feeds into comprehension | That's how reading works |
| Prediction in CL005 (late) | Prediction from Week 2 | Natural, accessible skill for 5-year-olds |
| Vocabulary as mid-sequence block | Vocabulary from Week 1, threaded throughout | Every shared reading teaches words |
| Common exception words in one cluster | 2-3 new words per week, daily revisiting | Spaced repetition, not massed practice |
| Discussing texts in CL006 (late) | From Week 1 alongside every shared reading | Discussion IS comprehension |
| Self-correction in CL005 (late) | Introduced Week 3, modelled from Week 2 | "Does it make sense?" is a decoding habit |

## Final Reflection

The graph scaffold is most useful as a **concept inventory and prerequisite map**. It ensures I haven't forgotten anything, and the prerequisite chains match my professional knowledge almost exactly. The teaching guidance, misconception notes, and key vocabulary are genuinely valuable planning resources — better than some published schemes I've used.

Where it falls down is in **temporal sequencing within a half-term**. The cluster algorithm doesn't understand that Year 1 phonics is a daily, interleaved practice where reading and writing (blending and segmenting) happen together, not in separate blocks. It doesn't know about Letters and Sounds phases or the statutory Phonics Screening Check. And it treats two deeply intertwined domains as parallel tracks.

If I were feeding back to the developers: the enrichment data is superb. The concept-level granularity is right for curriculum mapping. But the clustering algorithm needs to respect co-teaching signals more strongly — the Blending ↔ Segmenting co-teaching link EXISTS in the data but the clusters ignore it. And for subjects where domains are taught simultaneously (like Word Reading + Comprehension), the algorithm should offer an integrated sequence option, not just per-domain clusters.

For now, I'll use the graph as my concept checklist and the enrichment data as my teaching reference, and I'll trust my own professional judgement on sequencing and interleaving. That feels like exactly the right division of labour between graph and teacher.
