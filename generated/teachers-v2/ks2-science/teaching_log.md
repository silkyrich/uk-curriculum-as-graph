# Teaching Log: Y3 Science Autumn 1 Planning

**Teacher**: Dr Williams, Y3/4 Science Coordinator
**Half-term**: Autumn 1 (September - October, 6 weeks)
**Lessons**: 12 sessions (2 x 60 min per week)
**Topics**: Plants, Animals including Humans, Rocks (Y3 National Curriculum)

---

## Session 1: First Look at the Graph Context

I opened the graph context expecting three Y3 content domains — Plants, Animals including Humans, and Rocks — with Working Scientifically woven through. What I actually got was:

1. **Working Scientifically (SC-KS2-D001)** — 10 concepts, 7 clusters
2. **Plants (SC-KS2-D002)** — 6 concepts, 3 clusters
3. **Animals, Including Humans (SC-KS2-D003)** — 9 concepts, 5 clusters

Three immediate problems.

### Problem 1: Where are the Rocks?

Rocks is one of the three statutory Y3 science topics and it's completely absent from my planning context. This is a serious gap. I know the graph *has* a Rocks domain (SC-KS2-D004) because it appears as an external prerequisite — "SC-KS2-C021 (Soil Composition) from SC-KS2-D004" feeds into Plant Requirements for Life and Growth. So the data exists somewhere in the system, but it wasn't pulled into my planning file.

For a tool designed to support lesson planning, missing one of three statutory topics is a significant failure. I'll have to plan Rocks from the National Curriculum document directly and integrate it myself. That said, the cross-domain prerequisite link (Soil → Plant Requirements) is genuinely useful — it confirms what I'd do instinctively: teach Rocks and Plants in the same half-term so children see how soil connects to plant growth.

### Problem 2: Working Scientifically is Not a Content Domain

The graph has given me Working Scientifically as a standalone domain with its own clusters and a suggested sequence of 7 clusters spanning 70+ "lesson count" units. This fundamentally misunderstands how primary science works. Working Scientifically is not taught as a discrete unit — it's the *method* through which content is learned. You don't have a "Week 3: Fair Testing" lesson in isolation. You have a "Week 3: Which rock is most permeable?" lesson that *develops* fair testing skills.

The 10 Working Scientifically concepts are useful as a reference checklist — I can tick off which skills I'm embedding in each content lesson. But the 7-cluster sequence is meaningless for planning purposes. I'm going to ignore the WS clusters entirely and instead map WS concepts onto my content lessons as a skills overlay.

The graph's prerequisite chain within WS is sound, though:
- Questioning (C001) → Variable Control (C007) — yes, you need to ask questions before you can plan controlled enquiries
- Fair Testing (C002) → Variable Control (C007) — yes, simple comparative tests precede formal variable control
- Measurement (C003) → Precision (C008) — yes, basic measurement before repeat readings
- Data Presentation (C004) → Complex Data Recording (C009) — yes, tables before scatter graphs
- Conclusions (C005) → Causal Relationships (C010) — yes, simple conclusions before evaluating evidence

But the complexity ratings tell the real story: C001-C006 are complexity 3 (Lower KS2, Y3-4), while C007-C010 are complexity 4 (Upper KS2, Y5-6). For my Y3 class, I'm using C001-C006 and leaving C007-C010 for when these children reach Y5/6. The graph doesn't flag this year-group distinction clearly enough.

### Problem 3: Animals Spans All of KS2

The Animals domain contains 9 concepts, but they span four different year groups:

| Concept | NC Year | Appropriate for Y3 Autumn 1? |
|---|---|---|
| SC-KS2-C017 Animal Nutrition | Y3 | Yes |
| SC-KS2-C018 Skeletal and Muscular Systems | Y3 | Yes |
| SC-KS2-C031 Digestive System | Y4 | No — next year |
| SC-KS2-C032 Types and Functions of Teeth | Y4 | No — next year |
| SC-KS2-C033 Food Chains | Y4 | No — next year |
| SC-KS2-C046 Human Development and Ageing | Y5 | No — two years away |
| SC-KS2-C060 Circulatory System | Y6 | No — three years away |
| SC-KS2-C061 Diet, Exercise, Drugs and Lifestyle | Y6 | No — three years away |
| SC-KS2-C062 Nutrient and Water Transport | Y6 | No — three years away |

Only 2 of the 9 concepts are Y3 content. The clustering algorithm has grouped them by domain (which spans the entire key stage) rather than by year group. The first suggested cluster (SC-KS2-D003-CL001) puts Animal Nutrition, Teeth, Food Chains, and the Circulatory System together — mixing Y3, Y4, and Y6 content in a single "introduction" cluster. No Y3 teacher would do this.

This is, I think, a fundamental architectural issue. The graph organises by Key Stage domain, but teachers plan by year group. The tool needs a year-group filter before it's genuinely useful for term planning.

---

## Session 2: What I Actually Have to Work With

After filtering out the inappropriate content, my *real* Y3 Autumn 1 planning set is:

**Plants (from graph)** — 6 concepts, all Y3 appropriate:
- SC-KS2-C011: Plant Part Functions (weight 3, complexity 3)
- SC-KS2-C012: Plant Requirements for Life and Growth (weight 3, complexity 3)
- SC-KS2-C013: Water Transport in Plants (weight 3, complexity 3)
- SC-KS2-C014: Flowering Plant Life Cycle (weight 4, complexity 3, **KEYSTONE**)
- SC-KS2-C015: Pollination (weight 3, complexity 3)
- SC-KS2-C016: Seed Dispersal (weight 3, complexity 3)

**Animals including Humans (from graph, Y3 only)** — 2 concepts:
- SC-KS2-C017: Animal Nutrition (weight 3, complexity 3)
- SC-KS2-C018: Skeletal and Muscular Systems (weight 3, complexity 3)

**Rocks (NOT in graph — from NC document)** — approximately 3 concepts:
- Rock types, properties, and classification
- Fossil formation
- Soil composition (referenced as SC-KS2-C021 in graph prerequisites)

**Working Scientifically (skills overlay, not standalone)** — targeting Lower KS2:
- SC-KS2-C001: Questioning and Enquiry Selection
- SC-KS2-C002: Fair and Comparative Testing
- SC-KS2-C003: Systematic Measurement
- SC-KS2-C004: Data Classification and Presentation
- SC-KS2-C005: Drawing Conclusions and Predictions
- SC-KS2-C006: Scientific Reporting and Communication

So: **11 content concepts** across 3 topics for 12 lessons, with 6 WS skills embedded throughout. This is realistic. The graph's suggestion of 25 concepts in 12 lessons was not realistic — it was the consequence of not filtering by year group.

---

## Session 3: What the Graph Gets Right

I want to be fair. Despite the structural problems above, there's genuinely useful material here.

### The Plant Prerequisite Chain is Excellent

```
Plant Part Functions (C011) --> Water Transport (C013)
Flowering Plant Life Cycle (C014) --> Pollination (C015)
Flowering Plant Life Cycle (C014) --> Seed Dispersal (C016)
```

This matches my teaching sequence exactly. You *must* understand plant parts (roots, stems, leaves) before you can understand water transport through those parts. And you *must* understand the life cycle as a whole before you can dive into the specific mechanisms of pollination and seed dispersal. The graph has correctly identified C014 (Life Cycle) as a keystone concept — it's the organising framework that everything else hangs on.

The external prerequisite linking Soil Composition (SC-KS2-C021, Rocks domain) to Plant Requirements (C012) is a genuine cross-topic insight. I'd have made this connection myself, but it's good to see the graph encoding it explicitly. It confirms my plan to teach Rocks and Plants in the same half-term so children can see the link between soil (decomposed rock + organic matter) and what plants need to grow.

### The Teaching Guidance is Superb

Every concept has detailed, practical teaching guidance with specific activities. For example, the Water Transport concept (C013) suggests the coloured carnation/celery investigation, cross-section observation with magnifying glasses, and linking to root and stem function. These are exactly the investigations I'd choose. The vocabulary lists are comprehensive and age-appropriate. The common misconceptions are accurate — especially the persistent one about plants getting food from soil rather than making it through photosynthesis.

As someone with a plant biology PhD, I can confirm the science is sound throughout the Plants domain. The guidance correctly introduces photosynthesis at a conceptual level ("plants make their own food using light") without requiring the chemical mechanism — appropriate for Y3.

### The Co-Teaching Signals Within Animals Are Useful

Even though I'm only using 2 of the 9 Animals concepts this year, the co-teaching links show me what to foreshadow:
- Animal Nutrition ↔ Teeth (Y4 link) — I can mention teeth when discussing food types without formally teaching tooth types
- Animal Nutrition ↔ Food Chains (Y4 link) — I can introduce "animals eat plants or other animals" without formal food chain notation
- Skeletal and Muscular Systems ↔ Circulatory System (Y6 link) — too far ahead, but useful for my long-term planning

### The Concept Type and Complexity Metadata

All Plants concepts are type "knowledge" at complexity 3 — this tells me the domain is conceptually accessible for Y3 and doesn't require heavy procedural scaffolding. The two Animals Y3 concepts are also complexity 3. Compare this with the Y6 Animals concepts at complexity 4 with weight 5 — the graph correctly identifies these as heavier, more demanding content. If only it had then used this information to filter by year group...

---

## Session 4: The Clustering — Where I Disagree Most

### Plants Clusters: Partly Useful, Partly Odd

The algorithm suggests 3 clusters:

**CL001 (Introduction, Keystone)**: C011, C012, C013, C014 — four concepts, 13 "lesson count"
**CL002 (Assessment, Keystone)**: Same four concepts again — 13 "lesson count"
**CL003 (Practice)**: C015, C016 — Pollination and Seed Dispersal, 6 "lesson count"

The grouping in CL001 makes partial sense — Part Functions, Requirements, Water Transport, and Life Cycle are the core knowledge. But the algorithm has separated Pollination and Seed Dispersal into their own practice cluster, even though the prerequisite chain shows Life Cycle → Pollination and Life Cycle → Seed Dispersal. In practice, I'd teach the life cycle *with* pollination and seed dispersal, not separately. The life cycle is meaningless without understanding how pollen gets transferred and how seeds get away from the parent plant. They're the *mechanism* of the cycle.

The assessment cluster (CL002) is just a duplicate of CL001 with an "assessment" label. This isn't helpful — it doesn't tell me *what* to assess or *how*. For primary science (which is teacher-assessed, not exam-based), assessment is continuous. I build Assessment for Learning into every lesson through questioning, observation, and marking. I don't need a separate "assessment cluster" that repeats the same concepts.

My actual grouping:
- **Lessons 1-2**: Plant Parts + Requirements (C011, C012) — these go together because understanding parts leads into "what do plants need?"
- **Lesson 3**: Water Transport (C013) — this needs its own lesson for the celery practical (set up, observe, discuss)
- **Lesson 4**: Life Cycle + Pollination + Seed Dispersal (C014, C015, C016) — these are one story told across a lesson, with outdoor seed collecting

That's 6 concepts across 4 lessons. The graph suggested 32 "lesson count" across 3 clusters. The disconnect between algorithmic estimates and classroom reality is stark.

### Animals Clusters: Wrong for Y3

The algorithm's first Animals cluster puts Nutrition (Y3), Teeth (Y4), Food Chains (Y4), and Circulatory System (Y6) together. This would be like teaching a reception child long division because it's in the same maths domain. The clustering has no year-group awareness.

For Y3, I need 2 lessons:
- **Lesson 9**: Animal Nutrition (C017) — food groups, plant vs animal nutrition contrast
- **Lesson 10**: Skeletal and Muscular Systems (C018) — bones, muscles, movement

The co-teaching signal between Nutrition and Teeth is valid but premature — I'll mention teeth briefly but defer formal teaching to Y4.

### Working Scientifically Clusters: Fundamentally Misguided

Seven clusters for Working Scientifically as a standalone sequence. This is the most problematic part of the graph output. No primary teacher in England teaches WS as a block. The 2014 National Curriculum notes explicitly state: "Working scientifically is not a separate strand but must be embedded within the other science content."

The graph needs a mechanism to flag certain domains as "embedded" rather than "sequential." Working Scientifically, Mathematical Reasoning, and similar process domains should generate skills overlays, not standalone cluster sequences.

---

## Session 5: Seasonal Planning — The Missing Dimension

Autumn 1 is September to mid-October. This is *the* window for:

- **Plant observation outdoors** — deciduous trees still have leaves in September. By October half-term, many are dropping. This is the last chance to see flowers, collect seeds, and observe plant structures before winter.
- **Seed dispersal fieldwork** — conkers, sycamore helicopters, dandelion clocks, burdock burrs. September/October is peak season. The children can collect, classify, and test dispersal mechanisms with real specimens.
- **Rock hunting** — dry autumn days are perfect for outdoor geology. The school grounds, local parks, and building stones provide real specimens. Church graveyards (if accessible) show weathering beautifully.
- **Soil investigation** — September soil is dry enough to dig and sieve. You can see soil layers, find organic matter, and connect soil to rock origins.

The graph has **no seasonal awareness whatsoever**. It doesn't know that teaching seed dispersal in February would mean relying entirely on secondary sources, while teaching it in September means children can hold sycamore keys and blow dandelion clocks. This is a significant limitation for primary planning where hands-on, outdoor learning is essential.

My sequence is deliberately front-loaded with Plants and outdoor Rocks work in September (Weeks 1-4), moving Animals indoors for October (Weeks 5-6) when the weather is less reliable. The graph would have been equally happy to suggest the reverse order, which would waste the seasonal opportunity.

**Gap noted**: The graph should encode seasonal affordances, at least at the domain level. Something like `optimal_season: autumn` for Plants and Rocks, `season_independent: true` for Animals.

---

## Session 6: Building in Working Scientifically

Rather than following the graph's 7-cluster WS sequence, here's how I'm embedding WS skills across my 12 content lessons:

| WS Concept | Embedded In | How |
|---|---|---|
| C001 Questioning | Lessons 1, 5, 6, 9 | "What do you think will happen if...?" opening questions |
| C002 Fair Testing | Lessons 2, 7 | Plant requirements controlled experiment; Rock permeability test |
| C003 Measurement | Lessons 2, 3, 7, 10 | Measuring plant growth; Reading thermometers; Timing; Measuring forces |
| C004 Data Presentation | Lessons 2, 7, 8, 11 | Tables for plant observations; Bar charts for rock tests; Labelled diagrams |
| C005 Conclusions | Lessons 3, 7, 8, 11 | Drawing conclusions from plant experiments and rock investigations |
| C006 Reporting | Lessons 4, 8, 12 | Seed dispersal presentations; Science conference at end of unit |

Every WS concept is covered at least twice, most three or four times. This is progressive embedding — children encounter questioning in Week 1, then use it with increasing independence through to Week 6. Fair testing appears in both Plants (Week 1) and Rocks (Week 3) so children see the same skill applied in different contexts.

The graph's prerequisite chain (e.g., C001 → C007) is respected by omission — I'm not asking Y3 children to formally control independent and dependent variables (C007, complexity 4). They're doing simple comparative and fair tests (C002, complexity 3) which is the prerequisite. The progression built into the graph makes sense for long-term planning across KS2, even if the cluster sequence doesn't work for single-term planning.

---

## Session 7: Cross-Domain Integration

This is where the graph's prerequisite links genuinely help. The external prerequisite:

> SC-KS2-C021 (Soil Composition) from SC-KS2-D004 --> SC-KS2-C012 (Plant Requirements for Life and Growth)

...confirms a powerful cross-topic link. When we investigate soil in the Rocks unit (Week 4), we can connect directly back to Plants:
- Soil is made of broken-down rock particles + decomposed organic matter
- Plants get water and minerals (nutrients) from soil — but NOT their food
- This tackles the "plants get food from soil" misconception head-on

Similarly, the Animal Nutrition concept (C017) includes the explicit contrast between animal and plant nutrition: "animals cannot make their own food; they get nutrition from what they eat" vs "plants make their own food through photosynthesis." By teaching Plants before Animals, I set up this comparison beautifully. The graph flags this contrast in the teaching guidance — good.

The graph also shows an interesting co-teaching link I hadn't considered:

> Food Chains (C033) ↔ Animal Nutrition (C017)

Although Food Chains is formally Y4, I can lay groundwork in Y3 by asking: "If animals can't make their own food, where does their food come from?" This naturally introduces the idea of eating plants or eating other animals — the seed of food chain thinking. The graph's co-teaching signal validates this foreshadowing without requiring me to formally teach the Y4 content.

---

## Session 8: Assessment Planning

KS2 Science is Teacher Assessment — there's no statutory test. I assess through:

1. **Formative AfL (every lesson)**: Questioning, mini whiteboards, talk partners, observation during practicals. The graph's misconception lists are invaluable here — I can target my questioning at known misconceptions. For example:
   - "Do plants get their food from the soil?" (targeting the C012 misconception)
   - "Can muscles push as well as pull?" (targeting the C018 misconception)
   - "Is a conker a fruit?" (targeting the C016 misconception — yes, it is!)

2. **Practical assessment (Weeks 2, 3, 7)**: Observing children setting up fair tests, measuring accurately, recording systematically. These map directly to WS concepts C002-C004.

3. **Written/drawn outcomes (ongoing)**: Labelled diagrams of plant parts, classification tables for rocks, annotated skeleton diagrams. The graph's vocabulary lists provide the success criteria — can children use words like "absorb", "transport", "anchor" (C011 vocabulary)?

4. **End-of-unit assessment (Lesson 12)**: A "Science Showcase" where children present their learning — maps to WS concept C006 (Scientific Reporting). Groups present on different topics from the half-term, demonstrating understanding across Plants, Rocks, and Animals.

The graph's "assessment clusters" (CL002 in each domain) don't help with any of this. They're just copies of the introduction clusters with an "assessment" label. What I'd actually want from the tool is:
- Key assessment questions per concept (linked to misconceptions)
- Expected vocabulary for each year group
- Observable success criteria for WS skills at Y3 level

The misconception data is already there and it's excellent. The vocabulary lists are comprehensive. What's missing is the explicit connection to assessment — "assess this concept by checking whether children can X."

---

## Session 9: Where the Graph Helps vs Where It Doesn't

### Genuinely Helpful

1. **Concept descriptions and teaching guidance** — Detailed, accurate, practical. The Plant domain guidance is exactly what I'd write for an NQT. The suggested activities (celery in coloured water, controlled plant growth experiments, seed dispersal model-making) are classroom-tested and effective.

2. **Misconception lists** — Gold dust for assessment design. Every misconception listed is one I've encountered in 15 years of teaching. "Plants get food from soil" (C012), "muscles push and pull" (C018), "a fair test means everyone gets a turn" (C002) — these are real, persistent, and targeting them explicitly improves learning.

3. **Prerequisite chains within domains** — The Plant chain (Part Functions → Water Transport; Life Cycle → Pollination → Seed Dispersal) is pedagogically sound and confirms the teaching sequence.

4. **Cross-domain prerequisites** — Soil Composition → Plant Requirements is a genuine insight for cross-topic planning. The KS1 → KS2 links (Plant Structure → Plant Part Functions, Simple Testing → Fair Testing) help me pitch my teaching correctly — I know what the children should already understand.

5. **Keystone identification** — Flowering Plant Life Cycle (C014) is correctly flagged as a keystone. It's the organising concept — understanding the cycle makes pollination, seed dispersal, and reproduction make sense. I'll ensure this concept gets thorough treatment.

6. **Key vocabulary lists** — Comprehensive, age-appropriate, and curriculum-aligned. These become my working walls and success criteria.

### Not Helpful (or Actively Misleading)

1. **15 clusters for 12 lessons** — The algorithm doesn't account for year-group filtering, resulting in an absurdly large planning set.

2. **Working Scientifically as standalone clusters** — Fundamentally misaligned with how primary science is taught. WS is embedded, not sequential.

3. **Full KS2 Animals domain** — Mixing Y3-Y6 content without flagging which concepts belong to which year. A Y3 teacher shouldn't have to manually filter out Circulatory System content.

4. **Missing Rocks domain** — One of three statutory Y3 topics wasn't included. Critical oversight.

5. **Assessment clusters as concept duplicates** — Labelling a cluster "ASSESSMENT" without providing assessment-specific guidance doesn't help.

6. **No seasonal awareness** — September is seed dispersal season. The graph should know this.

7. **"Lesson count" metric** — The numbers (10, 13, 14, etc.) attached to clusters don't correspond to realistic lesson counts. CL001 for Plants shows "13 lessons" for 4 concepts, but I'll teach them in 3 lessons. The metric needs either recalibration or clearer labelling.

---

## Session 10: Final Reflection

The graph context is a powerful **reference document** but a poor **planning tool** in its current state. The concept descriptions, teaching guidance, vocabulary, and misconceptions are genuinely excellent — better than most published schemes of work. The prerequisite chains encode real pedagogical knowledge. The cross-domain links surface connections I might otherwise miss.

But the clustering algorithm has fundamental problems for primary planning:
- It operates at the Key Stage level when teachers plan at the year-group level
- It treats Working Scientifically as a content domain rather than an embedded skill set
- It doesn't account for seasonal teaching opportunities
- Its "assessment" clusters are hollow — they duplicate content without adding assessment guidance
- The lesson count estimates don't match classroom reality

My recommendation: the tool should let me specify "Y3, Autumn 1, Plants + Animals + Rocks" and return *only* the Y3-appropriate concepts, with WS concepts as a skills overlay rather than a standalone domain. The current output requires too much teacher filtering and reinterpretation — which is fine for me with 15 years' experience and a PhD, but would overwhelm an ECT.

What I'm taking forward into my lesson plan:
- All 6 Plants concepts (C011-C016) — the graph's sequence and guidance are excellent
- 2 Animals concepts (C017, C018) — filtered from the 9 provided
- 3 Rocks concepts — planned from NC documents since the graph didn't include them
- 6 WS concepts (C001-C006) — embedded across content lessons, not standalone
- Cross-domain link: Soil → Plant Requirements
- Misconceptions list as AfL question bank
- Vocabulary lists as success criteria and working wall content

Total: 11 content concepts + 6 embedded WS skills across 12 lessons. This is a professional half-term plan built *with* the graph but not *from* it.
