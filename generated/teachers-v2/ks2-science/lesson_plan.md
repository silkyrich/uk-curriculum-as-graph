# Y3 Science — Autumn 1 Lesson Plan

**Teacher**: Dr Williams, Y3/4 Science Coordinator
**Half-term**: Autumn 1 (September - October, 6 weeks)
**Lessons**: 12 sessions, 2 x 60 min per week
**Topics**: Plants | Rocks | Animals Including Humans
**Working Scientifically**: Embedded throughout (not standalone)

---

## Planning Rationale

The graph context provided 3 domains with 25 concepts across 15 clusters — far too much for 12 lessons. After filtering to Y3-appropriate content and adding the missing Rocks domain, the working set is:

- **Plants**: 6 concepts (SC-KS2-C011 to C016) — all from graph
- **Rocks**: 3 concepts (SC-KS2-D004) — **not in graph context**, planned from NC
- **Animals incl. Humans**: 2 concepts (SC-KS2-C017, C018) — filtered from 9 in graph
- **Working Scientifically**: 6 skills (SC-KS2-C001 to C006) — embedded, not clustered

**Sequence rationale**: Plants first (September — flowers and seeds still available outdoors), then Rocks (late September/early October — dry weather for fieldwork, connects soil to plant requirements), then Animals (October — indoor focus as weather turns). This is seasonal planning; the graph provides no seasonal guidance.

**Graph clusters referenced**: SC-KS2-D002-CL001, CL003 (Plants). Animals and Rocks clusters were not usable as provided (see teaching log).

## Week 1: Plants — Structure and Needs

### Lesson 1: What Are the Parts of a Plant?

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | SC-KS2-C011 (Plant Part Functions) |
| **Cluster ref** | SC-KS2-D002-CL001 (Introduction) |
| **Objective** | Identify and describe the functions of roots, stems, leaves, and flowers in flowering plants |
| **NC ref** | SC-KS2-O016 |
| **WS skills** | C001 (Questioning), C004 (Data presentation — labelled diagrams) |

**Key vocabulary**: root, stem, leaf, flower, absorb, anchor, transport, support, photosynthesis, function, petal, stamen

**Lesson structure** (60 min):
1. **Outdoor observation (20 min)**: Take children into the school garden / grounds. In pairs, sketch a flowering plant and label every part they can see. Prompt: "What do you think each part does for the plant?"
2. **Investigation (20 min)**: Back inside, provide uprooted plants (weeds from the garden — dandelions work well). Children examine roots with hand lenses. Use magnifying glasses to observe leaf veins. Pull apart a flower to see internal structures. Record observations as annotated diagrams.
3. **Direct teaching + discussion (15 min)**: Teach the four functions explicitly: roots absorb water and anchor; stems transport and support; leaves make food using light; flowers are for reproduction. Address misconception: "roots *only* soak up water" — they also anchor and absorb minerals.
4. **Plenary (5 min)**: Quick-fire: "I'll name a plant part, you tell me its job." Assessment: Can children link structure to function using correct vocabulary?

**AfL focus**: Do children understand that each part has a specific *function*, not just a name? Target misconception: flowers are "just decoration."

---

### Lesson 2: What Do Plants Need to Grow?

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | SC-KS2-C012 (Plant Requirements for Life and Growth) |
| **Cluster ref** | SC-KS2-D002-CL001 (Introduction) |
| **Objective** | Explore the requirements of plants for life and growth and how they vary |
| **NC ref** | SC-KS2-O017 |
| **WS skills** | C001 (Questioning), C002 (Fair testing — controlled experiment), C003 (Measurement) |

**Key vocabulary**: light, water, air, nutrients, soil, temperature, photosynthesis, requirements, conditions, minerals, carbon dioxide, fair test, variable, control

**Lesson structure** (60 min):
1. **Elicitation (10 min)**: What do plants need to stay alive and healthy? Collect ideas on whiteboard. Deliberately prompt: "Does a plant need food? Where does it get its food?" — surfacing the "food from soil" misconception.
2. **Setting up the investigation (30 min)**: This is the BIG practical — a controlled experiment running across several weeks.
   - 5 identical plants (cress or bean seedlings started the week before)
   - Plant A: Control — light, water, warm, soil
   - Plant B: No light (cupboard)
   - Plant C: No water
   - Plant D: No warmth (by window if cold, or fridge)
   - Plant E: No soil (cotton wool)
   - **WS focus**: "What makes this a fair test?" — same plant type, same pot size, same starting point, only ONE thing changed. Children record their predictions with reasons.
3. **Direct teaching (15 min)**: Plants make their own food using light (introduce photosynthesis as a concept — "photo" = light, "synthesis" = making). Contrast with animals who must eat food. Soil provides water and minerals, NOT food. This is the key conceptual shift.
4. **Recording (5 min)**: Set up observation table — date, plant condition, measurement (height in cm). We'll record weekly through Week 3.

**AfL focus**: Do children understand that plants MAKE their own food using light, and do NOT get food from soil? This is the most persistent misconception in primary plant biology.

**Cross-domain link**: Soil will be revisited in Rocks (Lesson 8) — the minerals that plants absorb come from broken-down rock. Flag this: "We'll find out more about soil when we study rocks."

---

## Week 2: Plants — Transport and Life Cycle

### Lesson 3: How Does Water Travel Through a Plant?

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | SC-KS2-C013 (Water Transport in Plants) |
| **Cluster ref** | SC-KS2-D002-CL001 (Introduction) |
| **Objective** | Investigate the way in which water is transported within plants |
| **NC ref** | SC-KS2-O018 |
| **WS skills** | C003 (Measurement — observation over time), C005 (Drawing conclusions) |

**Key vocabulary**: transport, vessel, tube, absorb, upward, wilt, stem, root, dissolve, evaporate

**Lesson structure** (60 min):
1. **Check plant experiments (10 min)**: Quick observations of the 5 plants from Lesson 2. Record in table. Which plants are changing? Why? Link: "Today we're going to find out HOW water gets from roots to leaves."
2. **Coloured water investigation (25 min)**: White carnations and celery sticks placed in cups of coloured water (set up 24 hours before — TA/teacher prep). Children observe: Where has the colour gone? Cut celery crosswise — use hand lenses to see coloured tubes. Draw diagrams of what they see, labelling the transport vessels.
3. **Direct teaching (15 min)**: Water travels UP through tiny tubes in the stem (like drinking straws inside the plant). Roots absorb water from soil → stems transport it upward → water reaches leaves and flowers. Demonstrate: what happens if you cut the stem? The supply is broken. Why do plants wilt? Not enough water reaching the leaves.
4. **Conclusion writing (10 min)**: Scaffold with sentence starters — "We found out that..." / "The coloured water showed us that..." / "This tells us that stems..." (WS: C005 Drawing Conclusions)

**AfL focus**: Can children explain the *route* water takes (root → stem → leaf) and *why* this matters for the plant?

**Practical note**: The celery investigation must be set up 24 hours before. Use different food colourings for different groups — when they compare results, they'll see the same pattern in different colours, reinforcing the conclusion.

### Lesson 4: The Life of a Flowering Plant

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | SC-KS2-C014 (Flowering Plant Life Cycle) **KEYSTONE**, SC-KS2-C015 (Pollination), SC-KS2-C016 (Seed Dispersal) |
| **Cluster ref** | SC-KS2-D002-CL001 + CL003 (merged — I disagree with separating these) |
| **Objective** | Explore the life cycle of flowering plants including pollination and seed dispersal |
| **NC ref** | SC-KS2-O019 |
| **WS skills** | C001 (Questioning), C004 (Data presentation — life cycle diagram) |

**Key vocabulary**: life cycle, germination, pollination, fertilisation, seed formation, seed dispersal, pollen, stamen, stigma, nectar, wind pollination, insect pollination, parachute, hook, explosive

**Lesson structure** (60 min):
1. **Outdoor seed hunt (15 min)**: September is PEAK seed dispersal season. Go outside with collection bags. Challenge: find as many different types of seed/fruit as possible. Likely finds: sycamore keys (wind), conkers (gravity/animal), dandelion heads (wind), burdock (animal hooks), blackberries (animal eaten), grass seeds (wind). Back inside, sort by dispersal method.
2. **Life cycle teaching (20 min)**: Draw the circular life cycle on the board, step by step:
   - Seed → Germination → Growth → Flowering → Pollination → Seed formation → Seed dispersal → back to seed
   - Emphasise the CYCLE — it's circular, not linear. Address misconception: "seed → plant → death" is NOT how it works.
   - **Pollination**: Pollen from stamen to stigma. Two methods: insects (bright flowers, nectar, scent, sticky pollen) and wind (small flowers, lots of light pollen, feathery stigma). Show examples of both.
   - **Seed dispersal**: Connect to the seeds collected. Why do seeds need to get AWAY from the parent? Competition for light, water, space.
3. **Seed dispersal engineering challenge (20 min)**: Design and make a seed that travels as far as possible when dropped from standing height. Materials: paper, card, cotton wool, tape, paper clips. Test designs. Measure distance. Best designs travel furthest — link structure to function.
4. **Plenary (5 min)**: Sequence the life cycle from memory on mini whiteboards. Can they get all stages in order?

**AfL focus**: This is the KEYSTONE concept. Can children describe the complete cycle? Do they understand that pollination leads to seed formation, and seed dispersal leads to new germination? Can they explain *why* dispersal is important?

**Note**: The graph correctly flags C014 as keystone and shows C014 → C015 and C014 → C016 as prerequisites. I've merged all three into one lesson because the life cycle only makes sense as a complete story. The graph's CL003 cluster separating Pollination and Seed Dispersal from the Life Cycle is pedagogically wrong — you can't understand dispersal without understanding *why* seeds need to disperse (to continue the cycle).

## Week 3: Rocks — Observation and Classification

### Lesson 5: What Rocks Can We Find?

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | Rock types and classification (SC-KS2-D004 — NOT IN GRAPH CONTEXT) |
| **Cluster ref** | None — Rocks domain was not included in graph output |
| **Objective** | Compare and group together different kinds of rocks on the basis of their appearance and simple physical properties |
| **NC ref** | "compare and group together different kinds of rocks on the basis of their appearance and simple physical properties" |
| **WS skills** | C001 (Questioning), C004 (Data presentation — classification) |

**Key vocabulary**: rock, mineral, granite, sandstone, limestone, chalk, marble, slate, ignite, sedimentary, metamorphic, igneous, texture, grain, crystal, classify, compare, property

**Lesson structure** (60 min):
1. **Rock hunt (20 min)**: Explore the school grounds and local area for different rocks. Look at building materials, playground surfaces, walls, gravel. Collect samples (or use a pre-prepared rock kit if outdoor access is limited). Each pair collects 5+ different rocks.
2. **Observation and sorting (20 min)**: Examine rocks with hand lenses. Children sort their rocks into groups using criteria THEY choose (colour, texture, weight, sparkly/dull, rough/smooth, etc.). Share grouping strategies. There's no single "right" answer — classification depends on the criteria chosen. Make a class display table.
3. **Direct teaching (15 min)**: Introduce the three rock types — sedimentary (layers, often contains fossils, relatively soft), igneous (crystals, hard, formed from cooling magma), metamorphic (changed by heat/pressure, often banded). Show clear examples of each. Children re-sort their rocks into these three groups.
4. **Recording (5 min)**: Draw and label their favourite rock with scientific vocabulary: colour, texture, hardness, grain size, type.

**AfL focus**: Can children observe systematically and sort using scientific criteria? Can they identify the three rock types from appearance?

**Graph gap**: This entire lesson is planned from the National Curriculum and my own subject knowledge because the Rocks domain was missing from the graph context. The concept descriptions, vocabulary lists, misconceptions, and teaching guidance that made the Plants planning so rich are all absent here. If the graph had included SC-KS2-D004, I would have had the same quality of reference material.

---

### Lesson 6: Which Rock is the Hardest? Which Lets Water Through?

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | Rock properties — hardness and permeability (SC-KS2-D004) |
| **Cluster ref** | None — Rocks domain not in graph |
| **Objective** | Compare rocks by testing their physical properties; set up fair tests |
| **NC ref** | "compare and group together different kinds of rocks on the basis of their simple physical properties" |
| **WS skills** | C002 (Fair testing), C003 (Measurement), C004 (Data presentation — tables, bar charts), C005 (Conclusions) |

**Key vocabulary**: permeable, impermeable, hardness, scratch, absorb, test, fair test, variable, compare, property, result, conclusion

**Lesson structure** (60 min):
1. **Planning the test (10 min)**: "We want to find out which rock lets the most water through. How can we make this a fair test?" Children identify: same amount of water, same size rock piece, same time — only the rock type changes. Reinforce WS from Lesson 2: what do we change, measure, keep the same?
2. **Permeability investigation (20 min)**: Drop measured amounts of water onto each rock type. Time how long it takes to absorb (or measure what runs off). Record results in a table. Draw a bar chart of results.
3. **Scratch test (10 min)**: Can you scratch the rock with a fingernail? A coin? A nail? Rank rocks from softest to hardest. This is a comparative test (simpler than the fair test above — good to contrast the two enquiry types).
4. **Conclusions and discussion (15 min)**: "Which rock would you choose for a roof? Why?" (Hard, impermeable — slate). "Which rock would you NOT use for a wall near a river? Why?" (Soft, permeable — chalk). Link properties to real-world uses.
5. **Plenary (5 min)**: Revisit the plant experiments from Lesson 2 — record observations. Any plants looking poorly? Why?

**AfL focus**: Can children set up and conduct a fair test with one variable changed? Can they record results in a table and draw a conclusion from them? This is a key WS assessment opportunity.

## Week 4: Rocks — Fossils, Soil, and the Link to Plants

### Lesson 7: How Are Fossils Formed?

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | Fossil formation (SC-KS2-D004) |
| **Cluster ref** | None — Rocks domain not in graph |
| **Objective** | Describe in simple terms how fossils are formed when living things become trapped within rock |
| **NC ref** | "describe in simple terms how fossils are formed when things that have lived are trapped within rock" |
| **WS skills** | C001 (Questioning — secondary research), C006 (Reporting) |

**Key vocabulary**: fossil, sediment, layer, impression, preserved, mineral, millions of years, palaeontologist, extinct, organism, rock, trapped, decay

**Lesson structure** (60 min):
1. **Stimulus (10 min)**: Show real fossils (ammonites, trilobites, fern impressions — available in school kit or from a museum loan). Children handle and observe. "What do you think this is? How did it get inside a rock?"
2. **Fossil formation model (20 min)**: Practical modelling activity. Press shells/leaves into clay (= organism trapped in sediment). Cover with another clay layer (= more sediment). Press down hard (= pressure over time). Remove the original object to see the impression. Discuss: the *organism* is gone, but its *shape* is preserved. Over millions of years, minerals replace the original material.
3. **Mary Anning research (15 min)**: Brief introduction to Mary Anning — the 12-year-old girl who found ichthyosaur fossils in Lyme Regis. Children read/listen to a short account and answer questions. WS: this is "researching using secondary sources" (C001 — one of the five enquiry types).
4. **Recording (10 min)**: Draw the fossil formation process as a 4-step sequence diagram: 1. Organism dies → 2. Covered by sediment → 3. Layers build up, pressure increases → 4. Minerals replace organism, leaving a fossil.
5. **Discussion (5 min)**: "What can fossils tell us about what lived here millions of years ago?" Link: fossils in limestone = the rock was formed under the sea.

**AfL focus**: Can children describe the process of fossil formation in sequence? Do they understand that fossils are evidence of past life, not just "pretty rocks"?

---

### Lesson 8: What Is Soil Made Of?

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | Soil composition (SC-KS2-C021 referenced in graph as external prerequisite), linking to SC-KS2-C012 (Plant Requirements) |
| **Cluster ref** | Cross-domain link identified by graph: SC-KS2-C021 → SC-KS2-C012 |
| **Objective** | Recognise that soils are made from rocks and organic matter; connect soil composition to plant requirements |
| **NC ref** | "recognise that soils are made from rocks and organic matter" |
| **WS skills** | C004 (Data presentation — classification), C005 (Conclusions) |

**Key vocabulary**: soil, organic matter, humus, mineral, rock particle, sand, clay, silt, decompose, nutrient, fertile, layer, horizon

**Lesson structure** (60 min):
1. **Soil investigation (20 min)**: Dig up soil from different locations in the school grounds (garden bed, under trees, playing field edge). Sieve soil through progressively finer meshes. What do you find? Large: stones, twigs, roots, leaves. Medium: gravel, decomposing matter. Fine: soil particles. Examine with hand lenses.
2. **Soil shake test (15 min)**: Put soil in a jar of water, shake vigorously, leave to settle. Over time, layers form: gravel at bottom → sand → silt → clay → water with organic matter floating. Label the layers. This shows soil is a *mixture* of rock particles and organic material.
3. **Cross-domain connection (15 min)**: "Remember what we learned about plant requirements? Plants need nutrients from soil. NOW we know what soil is — broken-down rock plus decomposed plant and animal matter. The minerals that plants absorb come from the rock particles. The organic matter (humus) makes soil fertile." This directly connects Rocks to Plants, using the graph's cross-domain prerequisite link.
4. **Revisit plant experiments (10 min)**: Final observation of the 5 plants from Lesson 2. The plant in cotton wool (no soil) — has it grown differently? It had water and light but no soil minerals. Discuss: soil provides minerals, not food. Reinforce the key distinction.

**AfL focus**: Can children explain what soil is made of? Can they connect soil composition to why plants need soil (minerals, not food)? This is the cross-domain assessment point.

**Graph note**: The cross-domain prerequisite link SC-KS2-C021 (Soil) → SC-KS2-C012 (Plant Requirements) was the most useful single insight from the graph context for cross-topic planning. I've built this lesson specifically around that connection.

## Week 5: Animals Including Humans — Nutrition and Skeletons

### Lesson 9: How Do Animals Get Their Nutrition?

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | SC-KS2-C017 (Animal Nutrition) |
| **Cluster ref** | SC-KS2-D003-CL001 (Introduction — though this cluster also includes Y4/Y6 content I'm not teaching) |
| **Objective** | Identify that animals need the right types and amount of nutrition and cannot make their own food |
| **NC ref** | SC-KS2-O020 |
| **WS skills** | C001 (Questioning), C004 (Data presentation — sorting/classifying) |

**Key vocabulary**: nutrition, nutrient, carbohydrate, protein, fat, vitamin, mineral, fibre, balanced diet, food group, energy, consumer, producer

**Lesson structure** (60 min):
1. **The Big Question (10 min)**: "How are animals and plants DIFFERENT in how they get their food?" Recall from Plants unit: plants MAKE their own food using light (photosynthesis). Animals CANNOT do this. Animals must EAT. Write on the board: "Plants = producers (make food). Animals = consumers (eat food)."
2. **Food group sorting (20 min)**: Provide food packaging and picture cards. Sort foods into groups: carbohydrates, proteins, fats, fruit & vegetables, dairy. Discuss what each group does for the body: carbohydrates = energy; protein = growth and repair; fats = energy and insulation; vitamins and minerals = keeping healthy. Use the Eatwell Guide as reference.
3. **Animal diet investigation (15 min)**: Compare diets of different animals. Herbivore (rabbit — eats plants), carnivore (owl — eats animals), omnivore (human — eats both). Link: the TYPE of food an animal eats relates to its body structure (teeth, claws, eyes). This foreshadows Y4 Teeth (C032) without formally teaching it — validated by the graph's co-teaching signal between C017 and C032.
4. **Design a balanced meal (10 min)**: Children design a balanced meal for a child their age, including at least one food from each group. Label with food group names.
5. **Plenary (5 min)**: True or false: "Plants eat food from the soil." FALSE — they make their own. "Humans are carnivores." FALSE — we're omnivores. "Carbohydrates give us energy." TRUE.

**AfL focus**: Can children explain WHY animals must eat (they can't make their own food)? Can they name the food groups and their functions? The plant-vs-animal nutrition contrast is the key conceptual understanding.

---

### Lesson 10: Skeletons and Muscles — How Do We Move?

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | SC-KS2-C018 (Skeletal and Muscular Systems) |
| **Cluster ref** | SC-KS2-D003-CL003 (Practice — though this cluster mixes Y3 and Y5/Y6 content) |
| **Objective** | Identify that humans and some animals have skeletons and muscles for support, protection, and movement |
| **NC ref** | SC-KS2-O021 |
| **WS skills** | C001 (Questioning), C004 (Data presentation — labelled diagrams) |

**Key vocabulary**: skeleton, bone, muscle, joint, skull, ribs, spine, pelvis, femur, support, protect, movement, contract, relax, endoskeleton, exoskeleton, hinge joint, ball-and-socket joint

**Lesson structure** (60 min):
1. **Skeleton exploration (15 min)**: Using a skeleton model or life-size poster, identify major bones: skull (protects brain), ribs (protect heart and lungs), spine (supports body, protects spinal cord), pelvis, femur. Children feel their own bones through skin — skull, ribs, kneecap, spine. "What would happen if you didn't have a skeleton?" (collapse like jelly!)
2. **Three jobs of the skeleton (10 min)**: Teach explicitly — Support (holds you up), Protection (skull protects brain, ribs protect organs), Movement (bones are the levers that muscles pull on). Children label a skeleton diagram with these three functions at different body points.
3. **Joint investigation (10 min)**: Compare hinge joints (elbow — moves one way, like a door) with ball-and-socket joints (shoulder — moves in all directions). Children test their own joints. "Which type of joint is your knee? Your hip? Your wrist?"
4. **Muscle model (15 min)**: Build a simple arm model with card (bones), paper fastener (joint), and elastic bands (muscles). Key teaching: muscles can only PULL (contract), they cannot push. That's why they work in pairs — biceps pulls to bend, triceps pulls to straighten. Address misconception: "muscles push AND pull." They only pull.
5. **Animals without skeletons (10 min)**: Brief exploration: endoskeletons (humans, fish), exoskeletons (insects, crabs — skeleton on the outside), no skeleton (worms, jellyfish). Advantages and disadvantages of each. "Why might having your skeleton on the outside be a problem if you want to grow?"

**AfL focus**: Can children name the three functions of the skeleton? Do they understand that muscles can only contract (pull), not push? Can they distinguish hinge and ball-and-socket joints?

---

## Week 6: Integration and Assessment

### Lesson 11: How Do Living Things Get What They Need?

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | Integration: C012 (Plant Requirements), C017 (Animal Nutrition), Soil Composition (C021), C011 (Plant Part Functions) |
| **Cluster ref** | Cross-domain synthesis — no single cluster |
| **Objective** | Compare and contrast how plants and animals obtain what they need; connect knowledge across all three topics |
| **NC ref** | Multiple — synthesis lesson |
| **WS skills** | C004 (Data presentation — comparison table), C005 (Drawing conclusions), C006 (Scientific reporting) |

**Key vocabulary**: nutrition, photosynthesis, producer, consumer, mineral, soil, skeleton, organ, function, system, requirement

**Lesson structure** (60 min):
1. **Big picture connection (15 min)**: Draw a concept map on the board linking all three topics:
   - Rocks break down → form soil
   - Soil provides minerals + water → absorbed by plant roots
   - Plants use light + water + CO2 → make their own food (photosynthesis)
   - Animals cannot make food → must eat plants or other animals
   - Animals have skeletons → support, protection, movement → helps them find and eat food
   Children copy the concept map and add their own connections.
2. **Comparison activity (15 min)**: Create a comparison table: Plants vs Animals.
   - How do they get food? (Make it / Eat it)
   - What do they need from the environment? (Light, water, air, soil minerals / Food, water, air, shelter)
   - How do they grow? (Roots, stems, leaves / Bones, muscles)
   - How do they reproduce? (Pollination, seeds / Birth, eggs)
3. **Quiz and self-assessment (15 min)**: 10 key questions covering all three topics — mix of recall, application, and misconception-busting:
   1. Name the four parts of a flowering plant and their functions.
   2. What do plants need to make their own food?
   3. How does water travel from roots to leaves?
   4. Put these in order: seed dispersal, pollination, germination, flowering.
   5. Name the three types of rock.
   6. What is soil made of?
   7. Why do plants need soil? (Minerals — NOT food!)
   8. Why must animals eat food? (They can't make their own.)
   9. Name the three jobs of the skeleton.
   10. Can muscles push? Explain.
   Children self-mark and traffic-light their confidence (green/amber/red).
4. **Preparation for showcase (15 min)**: Assign groups for Lesson 12 presentations. Each group chooses one topic: Plants, Rocks, or Animals. Plan what they'll present and how. Remind: good science communication uses diagrams, vocabulary, and evidence — not just words.

**AfL focus**: The quiz provides summative data. Traffic-light self-assessment identifies where children feel least confident — I'll use this to target support in Lesson 12 and inform my Teacher Assessment judgements.

### Lesson 12: Autumn 1 Science Showcase

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | All — revision and demonstration of understanding |
| **Cluster ref** | N/A — assessment and communication |
| **Objective** | Report findings using scientific language and present conclusions to an audience |
| **NC ref** | SC-KS2-O006 (reporting on findings) |
| **WS skills** | C006 (Scientific Reporting and Communication) — the main focus of this lesson |

**Key vocabulary**: report, findings, present, evidence, scientific language, conclusion, audience, diagram, display

**Lesson structure** (60 min):
1. **Group preparation (20 min)**: Groups prepare a 3-minute presentation on their topic. Must include:
   - At least one labelled diagram
   - At least 5 key vocabulary words used correctly
   - One "did you know?" fact that shows deep understanding
   - One question for the audience
   Provide materials: sugar paper, marker pens, access to their previous work from the half-term.
2. **Science conference (30 min)**: Each group presents to the class. Audience members ask questions after each presentation. I assess:
   - Correct use of scientific vocabulary
   - Accuracy of science content
   - Quality of diagrams and visual aids
   - Ability to answer questions from peers
3. **Celebration and reflection (10 min)**: What was the most surprising thing you learned this half-term? What are you most proud of? What question do you still have? Collect "questions I still have" — these inform Spring term planning and show scientific curiosity (WS: C001 Questioning).

**AfL focus**: This is the primary summative assessment for the half-term. I'm assessing:
- Scientific knowledge across all three topics (substantive knowledge)
- Working Scientifically skills, especially communication (disciplinary knowledge)
- Use of scientific vocabulary in context
- Ability to explain, not just describe

**Teacher Assessment note**: I'll use evidence from across the whole half-term — practical observations (Lessons 2, 3, 6), written work (Lessons 4, 7, 8), the quiz (Lesson 11), and these presentations — to make my Teacher Assessment judgement for science. There is no formal test.

## Working Scientifically Coverage Map

| WS Concept | Lessons | Depth |
|---|---|---|
| C001: Questioning & Enquiry Selection | 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 12 | Developed throughout — types of enquiry (fair test, observation over time, secondary research) |
| C002: Fair & Comparative Testing | 2, 6 | Two full fair tests (plant requirements, rock permeability) + one comparative test (rock hardness) |
| C003: Systematic Measurement | 2, 3, 6 | Measuring plant height (cm), water volume (ml), time |
| C004: Data Classification & Presentation | 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11 | Labelled diagrams, tables, bar charts, classification, comparison tables |
| C005: Drawing Conclusions | 3, 6, 8, 11 | Structured conclusion writing from investigations |
| C006: Scientific Reporting | 4, 7, 12 | Building towards the showcase — diagrams, sequence writing, full presentation |

All 6 Lower KS2 Working Scientifically concepts are covered at least twice, embedded in content contexts — never as standalone skills lessons.

Upper KS2 WS concepts (C007-C010) are deliberately excluded — they'll be taught in Y5/6 when children have the cognitive maturity for formal variable control, repeat measurements, and evidence evaluation.
