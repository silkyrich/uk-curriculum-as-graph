#### SC-KS2-C001: Relevant Questioning and Enquiry Selection

**Description**: The ability to ask relevant scientific questions and select the most appropriate type of scientific enquiry to answer them (observation over time, pattern seeking, classifying, fair testing, secondary research). Develops from KS1 simple questioning to active enquiry design.

**Teaching guidance**: Introduce the five types of scientific enquiry explicitly: observation over time, pattern seeking, classifying and grouping, comparative and fair testing, and researching using secondary sources. Present pupils with a question and ask them to decide which type of enquiry would best answer it. Use a 'question sorter' display where pupils categorise questions by enquiry type. Model asking relevant questions by connecting to the content being studied — for example, during a rocks topic ask 'Which rock is the most permeable?' (fair test) versus 'How are fossils formed?' (secondary research).

**Key vocabulary**: enquiry, investigate, fair test, comparative test, observation over time, pattern seeking, classify, secondary source, relevant, variable, method, question

**Common misconceptions**: Pupils often believe that all scientific questions must be answered by carrying out an experiment. They need explicit teaching that observation over time, classification, pattern seeking and secondary research are equally valid enquiry types. Some pupils confuse 'relevant' questions with 'interesting' questions — relevant questions are those that can be investigated scientifically.


#### SC-KS2-C002: Fair and Comparative Testing

**Description**: Setting up simple practical enquiries as fair tests, recognising and controlling variables. Understanding that a fair test changes only one variable at a time while keeping others constant, enabling valid comparisons.

**Teaching guidance**: Begin with comparative tests (e.g., 'Which surface does the car travel furthest on?') before introducing fair tests with controlled variables. Use a planning framework that explicitly asks: 'What will I change? What will I measure? What will I keep the same?' Provide practical contexts such as testing which paper towel is most absorbent or which material is best for insulating a cup of warm water. Encourage pupils to predict outcomes before testing and to explain why the test must be fair to get reliable results.

**Key vocabulary**: fair test, comparative test, variable, change, measure, keep the same, control, predict, result, reliable, method, equipment

**Common misconceptions**: Pupils frequently change more than one variable at a time without recognising this invalidates the comparison. Some pupils believe that a test is 'fair' simply because everyone in the group gets a turn, rather than understanding it as controlling variables. Pupils may also confuse prediction with guessing — a prediction should be based on existing knowledge or prior observations.


#### SC-KS2-C003: Systematic Measurement with Standard Units

**Description**: Making systematic and careful observations using standard units (e.g., degrees Celsius, metres, grams). Using a range of equipment including thermometers and data loggers. Increasing accuracy over Lower KS2.

**Teaching guidance**: Teach pupils to select appropriate equipment for the measurement being taken — rulers for length, thermometers for temperature, measuring cylinders for liquid volume, balances for mass. Practise reading scales with different intervals (ones, twos, fives, tens). Introduce data loggers for temperature and light investigations, demonstrating how they capture readings automatically over time. Link measurement to maths by reinforcing standard units (cm, m, g, kg, ml, l, °C) and by practising estimation before measuring.

**Key vocabulary**: measure, standard unit, centimetre, metre, gram, kilogram, millilitre, litre, degrees Celsius, thermometer, data logger, accurate, systematic, scale, interval, reading

**Common misconceptions**: Pupils commonly misread scales by counting lines rather than intervals, leading to systematic errors. Some pupils believe that digital instruments are always more accurate than analogue ones. Children may not understand that reading a thermometer requires waiting for the liquid to stop moving before recording the value.


#### SC-KS2-C004: Data Classification and Presentation

**Description**: Gathering, recording, classifying and presenting data in a variety of ways: simple scientific language, labelled diagrams, classification keys, bar charts, and tables. Moving from recording towards analytical presentation.

**Teaching guidance**: Teach each data presentation format explicitly: tables with headings and units, bar charts with labelled axes, and classification keys. Use sorting and grouping activities with real specimens (leaves, rocks, minibeasts) before introducing branching databases or keys. Model how to construct a bar chart step by step — choosing a scale, labelling axes, drawing bars accurately. Encourage pupils to select the most appropriate format for their data type (categories → bar chart, yes/no questions → classification key).

**Key vocabulary**: table, bar chart, axis, label, scale, tally, key, classification key, data, record, present, category, diagram, heading, unit

**Common misconceptions**: Pupils often confuse bar charts with pictograms or line graphs and may draw bars that do not start from the baseline. Some pupils think a table is simply writing numbers in any arrangement — they need to understand that tables have clear headings, units and consistent formatting. Children may also believe that more elaborate presentation (colour, decoration) makes data 'better'.


#### SC-KS2-C005: Drawing Conclusions and Predictions

**Description**: Using results to draw simple conclusions, make predictions for new values, suggest improvements and raise further questions. Iterative development of scientific understanding through evidence-based reasoning.

**Teaching guidance**: Scaffold conclusion-writing with sentence starters: 'Our results show that...', 'This happened because...', 'If we changed X, I predict that...' Teach the difference between describing results (what happened) and explaining them (why it happened). Introduce prediction for new values by asking pupils to extend patterns — for example, 'If we tested a fourth surface, what do you think would happen based on our results?' Encourage pupils to identify when results are unexpected and to suggest reasons or further tests.

**Key vocabulary**: conclusion, result, evidence, prediction, pattern, explain, because, support, suggest, further question, improve, unexpected, reason

**Common misconceptions**: Pupils often restate their prediction as their conclusion regardless of what the data actually shows. They may confuse correlation with causation — for example, concluding that one thing caused another simply because they occurred together. Some pupils think that if their prediction was wrong, the investigation has 'failed', rather than understanding that disconfirming evidence is equally valuable in science.


#### SC-KS2-C006: Scientific Reporting and Communication

**Description**: Reporting on findings from enquiries through oral and written explanations, displays and presentations. Using scientific language and illustrations to communicate findings to different audiences.

**Teaching guidance**: Provide opportunities for both oral and written reporting. Use 'science conferences' where groups present findings to the class, encouraging questions from the audience. Teach the structure of a scientific report: question, method, results, conclusion. Model the use of scientific vocabulary in explanations and provide word banks. Encourage pupils to use labelled diagrams and data displays as part of their communication, not just written prose.

**Key vocabulary**: report, findings, present, explain, scientific language, diagram, display, audience, evidence, method, results, conclusion, communicate

**Common misconceptions**: Pupils often think that writing more equals better science communication. They need to understand that clarity and precision matter more than length. Some pupils believe that scientific reports should only contain text, not realising that diagrams, tables and charts are essential components of scientific communication.


#### SC-KS2-C007: Variable Control in Enquiry Planning

**Description**: Planning scientific enquiries by recognising and controlling variables where necessary. Understanding which variables to keep constant, which to change, and which to measure. Required for valid experimental design.

**Teaching guidance**: Use a structured planning template that requires pupils to explicitly name the independent variable (what I will change), the dependent variable (what I will measure), and the control variables (what I will keep the same). Provide practice in identifying variables across different contexts before asking pupils to plan independently. Use 'spot the error' activities where pupils critique a flawed investigation plan and identify uncontrolled variables. Connect variable control to the concept of reliability — explaining why uncontrolled variables make results untrustworthy.

**Key vocabulary**: independent variable, dependent variable, control variable, plan, enquiry, method, reliable, valid, change, measure, keep the same, systematic, accuracy, precision

**Common misconceptions**: Pupils often confuse the independent and dependent variables, or believe that 'keeping things the same' refers to getting the same results rather than controlling conditions. Some pupils think that controlling variables means nothing should change at all, not understanding that the independent variable must be deliberately changed. Upper KS2 pupils may struggle to identify hidden variables that they have not considered.


#### SC-KS2-C008: Precision and Repeat Measurements

**Description**: Taking measurements with increasing accuracy and precision using a range of scientific equipment. Understanding the value of repeat readings to improve reliability and identify anomalies.

**Teaching guidance**: Demonstrate the importance of repeat measurements by having different groups measure the same thing and comparing their results. Discuss why readings differ and how taking multiple measurements and calculating a mean improves reliability. Teach pupils to identify and discard anomalous results before calculating averages. Use contexts where precision matters — such as measuring the time for a pendulum swing or the distance a ball rolls — to motivate the need for careful, repeated measurement.

**Key vocabulary**: precision, accuracy, repeat, reliable, anomaly, mean, average, measurement, reading, consistent, error, equipment, range, unit

**Common misconceptions**: Pupils often confuse accuracy (closeness to the true value) with precision (consistency of repeat readings). Some pupils believe that taking more decimal places automatically makes a measurement more precise. Children may think that if their result differs from a classmate's, one of them must be 'wrong', rather than understanding natural variation in measurement.


#### SC-KS2-C009: Complex Data Recording

**Description**: Recording data and results of increasing complexity using scatter graphs, line graphs, bar charts, classification keys, tables and scientific diagrams. Selecting the most appropriate representation for different types of data.

**Teaching guidance**: Introduce scatter graphs and line graphs as tools for continuous data, distinguishing them from bar charts used for categorical data. Teach pupils to plot points accurately and, where appropriate, draw lines of best fit. Provide opportunities to select the most suitable graph type for different investigations. Use ICT tools (spreadsheets, graphing software) alongside hand-drawn graphs. Model how to read information from graphs, including interpolating between data points and identifying trends.

**Key vocabulary**: scatter graph, line graph, bar chart, axis, scale, plot, data point, trend, line of best fit, classification key, table, continuous, categorical, interpret

**Common misconceptions**: Pupils often join scatter graph points dot-to-dot rather than drawing a line of best fit. They may confuse line graphs (for continuous data) with bar charts (for categorical data), using the wrong type for their data. Some pupils believe that a graph must always go through the origin (0,0), not understanding that this depends on the data.


#### SC-KS2-C010: Causal Relationships and Evidence Evaluation

**Description**: Identifying causal relationships in data. Evaluating degree of trust in results. Identifying scientific evidence that supports or refutes ideas and arguments. Distinguishing opinion from fact in secondary sources.

**Teaching guidance**: Use investigations with clear causal links (e.g., increasing temperature speeds up dissolving) to model the difference between correlation and causation. Teach pupils to evaluate the trustworthiness of results by considering sample size, whether variables were controlled, and whether results are repeatable. Introduce the idea that scientific claims require evidence by examining real examples of scientific debate. Use newspaper or media science claims as stimuli for critical evaluation, asking 'What is the evidence? Is it strong enough?'

**Key vocabulary**: cause, effect, causal, correlation, evidence, evaluate, trust, reliable, secondary source, opinion, fact, argument, support, refute, scientific claim

**Common misconceptions**: Pupils commonly assume that correlation implies causation — for example, that because ice cream sales and sunburn both increase in summer, ice cream causes sunburn. They may also believe that a single investigation provides definitive proof, rather than understanding that scientific conclusions become stronger with repeated, independent evidence. Some pupils struggle to distinguish between scientific evidence and personal opinion.

## Domain: Plants (SC-KS2-D002)

- **Subject**: Science
- **Year**: Y3
- **Structure type**: hierarchical

**Curriculum context**: The Plants domain at KS2 builds on the introductory plant knowledge from KS1 to develop a scientific understanding of the life processes, nutrition and reproduction of plants. Pupils investigate how plants grow and are structured, learning about the functions of the root, stem, leaf and flower in the plant's life cycle. The statutory content requires pupils to explore what plants need for life and growth, to understand photosynthesis as the process by which plants make food from sunlight, water 


### Statutory Objectives (4)

- **SC-KS2-O016** (statutory): identify and describe the functions of different parts of flowering plants: roots, stem/trunk, leaves and flowers
- **SC-KS2-O017** (statutory): explore the requirements of plants for life and growth (air, light, water, nutrients from soil, and room to grow) and how they vary from plant to plant
- **SC-KS2-O018** (statutory): investigate the way in which water is transported within plants
- **SC-KS2-O019** (statutory): explore the part that flowers play in the life cycle of flowering plants, including pollination, seed formation and seed dispersal


### Concepts (6)

| ID | Name | Type | Complexity | Weight | Keystone |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SC-KS2-C011 | Plant Part Functions | knowledge | 3 | 3 |  |
| SC-KS2-C012 | Plant Requirements for Life and Growth | knowledge | 3 | 3 |  |
| SC-KS2-C013 | Water Transport in Plants | knowledge | 3 | 3 |  |
| SC-KS2-C014 | Flowering Plant Life Cycle | knowledge | 3 | 4 | YES |
| SC-KS2-C015 | Pollination | knowledge | 3 | 3 |  |
| SC-KS2-C016 | Seed Dispersal | knowledge | 3 | 3 |  |


#### SC-KS2-C011: Plant Part Functions

**Description**: Understanding that different parts of flowering plants have specific functions: roots (anchorage and water/nutrient uptake), stems/trunks (support and water transport), leaves (photosynthesis and gas exchange), flowers (reproduction). Structure-function relationship.

**Teaching guidance**: Investigate root function by growing plants in transparent containers so pupils observe root growth. Demonstrate water transport by placing white carnations or celery in coloured water and observing colour change in petals or leaves over 24 hours. Use leaf rubbings and close observation with hand lenses to explore leaf structure. Dissect flowers to connect flower parts to their reproductive function. Create annotated diagrams linking each plant part to its role: roots absorb water and anchor; stems transport water and support; leaves make food using light; flowers enable reproduction.

**Key vocabulary**: root, stem, leaf, flower, absorb, anchor, transport, support, photosynthesis, nutrition, reproduction, petal, stamen, carpel, pollen, function

**Common misconceptions**: Pupils often think that roots only absorb water, not realising they also anchor the plant and absorb dissolved minerals. Many children believe that plants get their food from the soil rather than making it in their leaves through photosynthesis. Some pupils think all flowers are decorative and do not understand their essential reproductive function.


#### SC-KS2-C012: Plant Requirements for Life and Growth

**Description**: Understanding that plants need air, light, water, nutrients from soil, and room to grow. These requirements vary between plant species. Plants can make their own food (photosynthesis concept introduced without detailed mechanism).

**Teaching guidance**: Set up controlled investigations where plants are deprived of one requirement at a time — one group with no light, one with no water, one in a cold environment — while a control plant receives all requirements. Record observations over two to three weeks using a consistent observation schedule. Introduce the concept that plants make their own food using light (photosynthesis) without requiring the detailed mechanism. Compare plant nutrition with animal nutrition — plants make food, animals must eat. Discuss why different plants may need different amounts of light or water.

**Key vocabulary**: light, water, air, nutrients, soil, temperature, photosynthesis, food, grow, healthy, survive, requirements, conditions, minerals, carbon dioxide

**Common misconceptions**: The most persistent misconception is that plants get their food from the soil. Plants make their own food through photosynthesis — they absorb water and minerals from the soil but these are raw materials, not food. Some children think plants only need sunlight and water, forgetting that air (carbon dioxide) is also essential. Children may believe that fertiliser is plant food rather than a mineral supplement.


#### SC-KS2-C013: Water Transport in Plants

**Description**: Understanding that water is transported upward within plants through the stem to leaves and flowers. Observable through the coloured carnation investigation. Links root function to water availability and stem function to transport.

**Teaching guidance**: Conduct the classic coloured water investigation: place white carnations or celery sticks in water with food colouring and observe the results after several hours. Cut celery stalks crosswise to reveal the coloured transport vessels. Use magnifying glasses to examine the tiny tubes visible in cut stems. Connect this observation to the function of roots (absorbing water) and stems (transporting it upward). Discuss why plants wilt when they lack water — the transport system has nothing to carry.

**Key vocabulary**: transport, water, stem, root, absorb, vessel, tube, upward, wilt, leaf, flower, nutrients, dissolved, minerals

**Common misconceptions**: Pupils often think water travels through the centre of the stem rather than through specialised tubes (xylem vessels) near the outside. Some children believe the plant 'sucks' water up like a straw, rather than understanding that water is drawn up by evaporation from the leaves (transpiration pull). Children may not connect wilting to water transport failure.


#### SC-KS2-C014: Flowering Plant Life Cycle

**Description**: Understanding the complete life cycle of flowering plants: germination, growth, pollination, seed formation, seed dispersal, and back to germination. Understanding the role of flowers in reproduction and the variety of seed dispersal mechanisms.

**Teaching guidance**: Create a life cycle diagram as a circular flow chart, emphasising that it is a continuous cycle. Grow fast-cycling plants such as rapid-cycling brassicas (Wisconsin Fast Plants) that complete their life cycle in 35-40 days, allowing pupils to observe every stage. Dissect mature flowers to observe pollen and ovules. Collect seed heads and fruits to examine dispersal structures. Use time-lapse videos to show stages that are too slow to observe in real time. Compare the flowering plant life cycle with animal life cycles studied later.

**Key vocabulary**: life cycle, germination, growth, pollination, fertilisation, seed formation, seed dispersal, flower, fruit, pollen, ovule, reproduce, mature, cycle

**Common misconceptions**: Children often think of a life cycle as linear (seed → plant → death) rather than circular. Some pupils believe all plants grow from seeds, not recognising that bulbs, tubers and runners are also starting points. Children may confuse pollination (transfer of pollen) with fertilisation (fusion of male and female cells) or use the terms interchangeably.


#### SC-KS2-C015: Pollination

**Description**: Understanding that pollination is the transfer of pollen between flowers, enabling seed formation. Part of the flowering plant reproductive cycle. Includes wind and insect pollination.

**Teaching guidance**: Examine flowers with hand lenses to identify the pollen-producing stamens and the pollen-receiving stigma. Compare insect-pollinated flowers (bright petals, scent, nectar, sticky pollen) with wind-pollinated flowers (small petals or none, large amounts of light pollen, feathery stigmas). Observe bees visiting flowers in the school garden if possible, discussing how pollen is transferred on their bodies. Use role-play or models to demonstrate pollen transfer between flowers. Link pollination to fruit and seed formation as the next stage in the plant life cycle.

**Key vocabulary**: pollination, pollen, stamen, stigma, anther, insect pollination, wind pollination, nectar, transfer, flower, bee, reproduce, fertilisation

**Common misconceptions**: Children often confuse pollination with seed dispersal or think pollination is the same as fertilisation. Some pupils believe bees deliberately collect pollen to help plants, rather than understanding that pollination is an incidental consequence of bees feeding on nectar. Children may think that all flowers are insect-pollinated, not recognising wind pollination in grasses and many trees.


#### SC-KS2-C016: Seed Dispersal

**Description**: Understanding that seeds are dispersed from parent plants by various mechanisms including wind, water, animals (internally and externally) and explosive mechanisms. Structure of fruits relates to dispersal method.

**Teaching guidance**: Collect a variety of seeds and fruits and challenge pupils to identify their dispersal mechanism by examining their structures. Examples: dandelion (wind — parachute), sycamore (wind — helicopter), burdock (animal — hooks), cherry (animal — eaten), coconut (water — floats), pea pod (explosive — springs open). Design and make seed dispersal models (paper helicopters, parachutes) and test which designs travel furthest. Discuss why dispersal away from the parent plant is advantageous — reduced competition for light, water and space.

**Key vocabulary**: seed dispersal, wind, water, animal, explosive, parachute, hook, fruit, scatter, spread, structure, mechanism, advantage, competition, germination

**Common misconceptions**: Children often think fruits are only the sweet edible items found in supermarkets. In biology, a fruit is any structure that contains seeds — including sycamore wings, conkers and pea pods. Some pupils believe seeds need to land on soil to grow, rather than understanding that seeds can germinate in many substrates if conditions are right. Children may not understand why dispersal is beneficial, thinking it would be better for seeds to stay near the parent plant.

#### SC-KS2-C017: Animal Nutrition

**Description**: Understanding that animals, including humans, require the right types and amounts of nutrition and cannot make their own food — they obtain nutrition from what they eat. Contrasts with plants which can make their own food.

**Teaching guidance**: Explore the concept that animals, unlike plants, cannot make their own food and must eat other organisms. Classify foods into food groups (carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, fibre, water) and discuss the role of each in the body. Compare the diets of different animals and relate diet to body structure and habitat. Use food packaging labels to identify nutrients. Emphasise the contrast with plants — animals are consumers, plants are producers. Link to the concept of a balanced diet and why variety matters for health.

**Key vocabulary**: nutrition, nutrient, carbohydrate, protein, fat, vitamin, mineral, fibre, balanced diet, food group, energy, consumer, producer, diet, health

**Common misconceptions**: Pupils often think 'nutrition' means only eating healthy food, rather than understanding it as the process of obtaining the substances needed for growth and energy. Some children believe that fat and carbohydrates are always 'bad' rather than essential in appropriate amounts. Children may not understand the fundamental difference between plant and animal nutrition — that plants make their food while animals must consume it.


#### SC-KS2-C018: Skeletal and Muscular Systems

**Description**: Understanding that humans and some other animals have skeletons for support, protection and movement. Muscles are attached to bones and enable movement by contracting and relaxing. Different body parts have different skeletal structures suited to their functions.

**Teaching guidance**: Use life-sized skeleton models or posters to identify major bones: skull, ribs, spine, pelvis, femur, humerus. Ask pupils to feel their own bones through their skin to connect the model to their bodies. Demonstrate how joints allow movement by comparing hinge joints (elbow, knee) with ball-and-socket joints (shoulder, hip). Use elastic bands attached to cardboard tubes to model how muscles pull on bones — showing that muscles can only pull (contract), not push. Investigate which animals have endoskeletons, exoskeletons, or no skeleton, and discuss the advantages of each.

**Key vocabulary**: skeleton, bone, muscle, joint, skull, ribs, spine, pelvis, femur, support, protect, movement, contract, relax, endoskeleton, exoskeleton, hinge, ball-and-socket

**Common misconceptions**: Children commonly think muscles both push and pull — in reality, muscles can only contract (pull) and work in antagonistic pairs to produce movement in both directions. Some pupils believe the skeleton is a dead, rigid structure rather than living tissue that grows and repairs. Children may not realise that some animals (insects, crabs) have their skeleton on the outside (exoskeleton) and that some animals (worms, jellyfish) have no skeleton at all.


#### SC-KS2-C031: Digestive System

**Description**: Understanding the functions of the basic parts of the human digestive system: mouth (chewing, saliva), oesophagus (transport), stomach (churning, digestion), small intestine (nutrient absorption), large intestine (water absorption). Food is broken down to release nutrients.

**Teaching guidance**: Use a large-scale diagram or model of the digestive system for pupils to trace the journey of food from mouth to large intestine. Create a physical simulation using a plastic bag (stomach) with bread and orange juice to show churning and chemical breakdown. Use tights filled with mashed banana to demonstrate the squeezing action of the oesophagus (peristalsis). Label the key organs and their functions: mouth (chewing and saliva), oesophagus (muscular tube), stomach (acid and churning), small intestine (nutrient absorption), large intestine (water absorption). Link to nutrition — digestion breaks food down so nutrients can be absorbed into the blood.

**Key vocabulary**: digestive system, mouth, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, saliva, chew, digest, absorb, nutrient, enzyme, acid, peristalsis, breakdown, organ

**Common misconceptions**: Children commonly think the stomach is the main organ of digestion, when in fact most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption occurs in the small intestine. Some pupils believe food passes through the body in one tube with the stomach at the bottom, rather than understanding the winding path through distinct organs with different functions. Children may think digestion is only mechanical (chewing), not understanding the role of chemical breakdown by enzymes and acid.


#### SC-KS2-C032: Types and Functions of Teeth

**Description**: Understanding that humans have different types of teeth with different functions: incisors (cutting), canines (tearing), premolars and molars (grinding). Diet of carnivores and herbivores relates to different tooth structures.

**Teaching guidance**: Examine real or model teeth to identify the four types: incisors (flat, sharp, at the front — for cutting and biting), canines (pointed — for tearing), premolars and molars (flat, broad — for crushing and grinding). Use mirrors for pupils to examine their own teeth and identify each type. Compare human teeth with those of herbivores (flat, ridged molars for grinding plants) and carnivores (large canines and carnassials for tearing meat). Link tooth type to diet and feeding behaviour. Discuss dental health: the role of bacteria and sugar in tooth decay, and how brushing and diet protect teeth. Consider using disclosing tablets to show plaque.

**Key vocabulary**: incisor, canine, premolar, molar, cut, tear, grind, crush, tooth, teeth, enamel, decay, dentine, pulp, root, crown, carnivore, herbivore, omnivore, plaque

**Common misconceptions**: Children often think humans have only two types of teeth (front teeth and back teeth) rather than four types with distinct functions. Some pupils believe that baby teeth do not matter because they will fall out, not understanding that decay can affect the permanent teeth developing beneath. Children may think herbivores have no sharp teeth at all — in fact, many herbivores have sharp incisors for cutting grass and leaves.


#### SC-KS2-C033: Food Chains with Producers, Predators and Prey

**Description**: Constructing and interpreting food chains that include producers (plants), consumers, predators and prey. Understanding that food chains show the flow of energy and that producers are always the starting point. Extends KS1 simple food chains.

**Teaching guidance**: Build food chains using real organisms from a local habitat, starting with a producer (green plant) and showing energy flow through arrows. Emphasise that the arrow means 'is eaten by' or 'provides energy for', not 'eats'. Introduce the terms producer, consumer, predator and prey explicitly. Construct multiple food chains from the same habitat and discuss what happens if one organism is removed — does the chain collapse? Use food chain card games where pupils assemble chains from shuffled organism cards. Link to habitats work and classification.

**Key vocabulary**: food chain, producer, consumer, predator, prey, energy, arrow, habitat, organism, plant, herbivore, carnivore, top predator, population, depend

**Common misconceptions**: The most common error is drawing food chain arrows in the wrong direction — arrows should point from the organism being eaten to the organism doing the eating, showing the direction of energy flow. Children often think predators are always large, fierce animals and do not recognise that a ladybird eating an aphid is also a predator-prey relationship. Some pupils believe removing one organism from a food chain only affects the organism directly above or below it, not understanding the cascading effects.


#### SC-KS2-C046: Human Development and Ageing

**Description**: Understanding the full sequence of human development from birth through childhood, puberty, adulthood and old age. Changes at puberty are introduced. Timeline of growth stages. Gestation period concept.

**Teaching guidance**: Create a human timeline showing the stages from birth through infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood and old age, using photographs to illustrate each stage. Discuss the physical changes at each stage — growth in height and weight, development of teeth, puberty changes (growth spurts, body shape changes, development of secondary sexual characteristics). Handle puberty sensitively, following school RSE policy and ensuring a safe environment for questions. Compare human development timelines with those of other animals — some develop rapidly (mice), others slowly (elephants). Discuss gestation periods of different mammals.

**Key vocabulary**: development, growth, baby, toddler, child, adolescent, teenager, adult, elderly, puberty, gestation, stage, life span, ageing, mature, reproduce

**Common misconceptions**: Children often think puberty happens at the same age for everyone, not understanding that there is a wide normal range (typically 8-14 for onset). Some pupils believe that growing old means the body simply wears out, rather than understanding that ageing involves specific biological processes. Children may not recognise that human development is much slower than most other mammals — a cat reaches adulthood in about one year.


#### SC-KS2-C060: Circulatory System

**Description**: Understanding the main parts of the human circulatory system: heart (pump), blood vessels (arteries carry oxygenated blood from heart, veins return deoxygenated blood, capillaries enable exchange). Blood transports nutrients, oxygen and waste. Functions of each component.

**Teaching guidance**: Use a large diagram or 3D model of the heart showing its chambers, valves and connected blood vessels. Demonstrate the pumping action by squeezing a rubber ball to simulate heartbeats. Measure pulse rate before and after exercise to show the heart responds to the body's needs. Trace the route of blood: heart → arteries → capillaries (where exchange occurs) → veins → heart → lungs (for oxygen) → heart. Use red and blue to distinguish oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in diagrams. Discuss the role of blood in transporting oxygen, nutrients and waste. Link to the respiratory system — the lungs oxygenate blood before it returns to the heart.

**Key vocabulary**: heart, blood, blood vessel, artery, vein, capillary, pump, oxygenated, deoxygenated, oxygen, circulatory system, pulse, chamber, valve, lung, transport, cell

**Common misconceptions**: Children often think the heart is on the left side of the chest — it is actually roughly central, slightly to the left. Some pupils believe blood is blue in veins and red in arteries — blood is always red; deoxygenated blood is dark red, not blue (veins appear blue through the skin due to how light penetrates tissue). Children may think the heart only pumps blood one way, not understanding the double circulation through the lungs and around the body.


#### SC-KS2-C061: Diet, Exercise, Drugs and Lifestyle

**Description**: Understanding that diet, exercise, drugs and lifestyle choices affect how the body functions. Both beneficial choices (regular exercise, balanced diet) and harmful choices (drugs, poor diet) have impacts on body function and health.

**Teaching guidance**: Investigate the effects of exercise on heart rate and breathing rate through practical measurement — measure resting pulse, exercise for 2 minutes, then measure pulse again at intervals. Discuss the components of a balanced diet using the Eatwell Guide, linking nutrient types to body functions (protein for growth and repair, carbohydrates for energy, fats for insulation and energy). Discuss the impact of harmful substances — tobacco on lungs and circulation, alcohol on the liver and brain — using age-appropriate resources. Explore lifestyle choices: sleep, hydration, mental health. Use case studies or role-play scenarios where characters make different lifestyle choices and discuss the consequences.

**Key vocabulary**: diet, exercise, balanced, healthy, nutrient, drug, tobacco, alcohol, lifestyle, heart rate, breathing rate, energy, protein, carbohydrate, fat, vitamin, organ, wellbeing

**Common misconceptions**: Children often think 'drugs' only refers to illegal substances, not understanding that medicines, caffeine and alcohol are also drugs. Some pupils believe that exercise is only beneficial if you are overweight, rather than understanding its benefits for cardiovascular health, mental health and bone strength regardless of weight. Children may think a 'balanced diet' means eating equal amounts of all food groups, rather than proportions recommended in the Eatwell Guide.


#### SC-KS2-C062: Nutrient and Water Transport in Animals

**Description**: Understanding that the circulatory system transports nutrients (absorbed from the small intestine) and water to all cells in the body. Blood is the transport medium. This links the digestive system output to the circulatory system.

**Teaching guidance**: Link the digestive system (studied in Y4) to the circulatory system: nutrients absorbed through the wall of the small intestine enter the blood and are transported to cells throughout the body. Use diagrams showing blood capillaries surrounding the small intestine to illustrate absorption. Discuss what happens to water — absorbed mainly in the large intestine and transported by blood. Trace the journey of a nutrient molecule from food on the plate through digestion, absorption, transport in blood and delivery to a cell. This concept bridges Y4 digestion knowledge with Y6 circulation knowledge, building an integrated understanding of body systems working together.

**Key vocabulary**: nutrient, water, transport, blood, circulatory system, digestive system, absorb, small intestine, large intestine, cell, capillary, dissolve, deliver, oxygen, waste, organ system

**Common misconceptions**: Children often think food goes directly from the stomach to the rest of the body without understanding the role of the small intestine in absorption and the blood in transport. Some pupils believe the body uses food in its original form (e.g., a piece of bread reaching the muscles) rather than understanding that food must be broken down into tiny dissolved nutrient molecules. Children may not connect the digestive and circulatory systems as working together.
