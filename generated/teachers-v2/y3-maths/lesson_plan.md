## Week 1: Counting — Building Bridges from Year 2

### Lesson 1 — Y2 Recap: What Do We Remember?
- **Concept ID(s):** N/A (Y2 review — external prerequisites MA-Y2-C001, MA-Y2-C003, MA-Y2-C005)
- **Cluster:** N/A (teacher addition — not in algorithm clusters)
- **Objective:** Recall counting in steps of 2, 5 and 10; demonstrate two-digit place value; use <, > and = symbols correctly.
- **Key vocabulary:** count, tens, ones, place value, greater than, less than, equal to
- **Lesson structure:**
  - **Starter (5 min):** Stand-up counting game — count around the class in 2s, then 5s, then 10s. Anyone who hesitates sits down.
  - **Main (20 min):** Four-station carousel (5 min each): (1) Build two-digit numbers with Dienes on a place value mat, (2) Order a set of numbers using < > = symbols, (3) Count forwards and backwards in 10s from any two-digit number, (4) Number bonds to 20 quick-fire with a partner.
  - **Practice (10 min):** Independent written task — 12 quick questions covering all four areas. Diagnostic: I collect and mark during lunch.
  - **Plenary (5 min):** "What was easy? What was tricky? What do you think we'll learn this year in maths?" Set the tone.

### Lesson 2 — Counting in Multiples of 4: Introduction
- **Concept ID(s):** MA-Y3-C001
- **Cluster:** Algorithm CL001 (kept — counting multiples as opening move)
- **Objective:** Count forwards in multiples of 4 from 0 to at least 48, connecting to the known ×2 pattern.
- **Key vocabulary:** multiple, count in fours, skip count, sequence, pattern, four times table
- **Lesson structure:**
  - **Starter (5 min):** Count in 2s to 24 as a class. "Now watch — I'm going to count in fours. What do you notice?" Write both sequences on the board. Draw out: every other number in the 2s appears in the 4s.
  - **Main (15 min):** Concrete: each pair has 48 cubes. Group them in 4s. Count the groups: 4, 8, 12, 16... Record on a number line. Pictorial: highlight multiples of 4 on a hundred square. What patterns can you see? (Diagonal pattern, always even.)
  - **Practice (15 min):** Worksheet — continue counting sequences in 4s (starting from 0, from 12, from 28). Fill in missing numbers. "True or false: 26 is a multiple of 4."
  - **Plenary (5 min):** Choral count in 4s to 48. Quick-fire: "What comes after 20 in the 4s pattern? After 36?"

---

### Lesson 3 — Counting in Multiples of 4: From Any Starting Point
- **Concept ID(s):** MA-Y3-C001
- **Cluster:** CL001 (kept)
- **Objective:** Count forwards and backwards in multiples of 4 from any given multiple, not just zero.
- **Key vocabulary:** multiple, forwards, backwards, continue, sequence
- **Lesson structure:**
  - **Starter (5 min):** "Start at 24. Count in 4s. What's next? And next?" Hands up, rapid responses. Then: "Start at 40. Count BACKWARDS in 4s."
  - **Main (15 min):** Pairs game — "4s Ping-Pong": one child says a multiple of 4, partner says the next one, back and forth. If you hesitate for more than 3 seconds, your partner scores a point. Then reverse: counting backwards. Use hundred square for support.
  - **Practice (15 min):** Independent: sequence completion from mid-sequence starting points. "Continue: 16, 20, __, __, __." "Continue backwards: 44, 40, __, __, __." Challenge: "Is 34 a multiple of 4? How do you know?"
  - **Plenary (5 min):** Class discussion: "What strategy do you use when you get stuck?" Surface the adding-4 strategy and the doubling-2 strategy. Celebrate both.

### Lesson 4 — Counting in Multiples of 50: Introduction
- **Concept ID(s):** MA-Y3-C003
- **Cluster:** CL001 (kept)
- **Objective:** Count forwards in multiples of 50 to 1000, connecting to money and measurement contexts.
- **Key vocabulary:** fifty, multiple, count in fifties, sequence, scale
- **Lesson structure:**
  - **Starter (5 min):** Show a pile of 50p coins. "If I keep adding 50p coins, how much money will I have?" Count together: 50p, £1, £1.50, £2... Record as 50, 100, 150, 200...
  - **Main (15 min):** Number line from 0 to 1000 on the board, marked in 50s. Count together, pointing to each mark. "It's like counting in 5s but with an extra zero!" Show this: write 5, 10, 15, 20... underneath write 50, 100, 150, 200... Pictorial: a weighing scale with 50g markings — read the scale as counting in 50s.
  - **Practice (15 min):** Mixed tasks — sequence completion (50, 100, __, __, 250), scale reading (what does this weighing scale show?), money totals (how much in 50p coins to make £4.50?).
  - **Plenary (5 min):** "Count in 50s from 0 to 500. Now count from 500 to 0." Class chant. Note any hesitations at the hundred boundaries.

---

### Lesson 5 — Counting in Multiples of 50: Boundaries and Both Directions
- **Concept ID(s):** MA-Y3-C003
- **Cluster:** CL001 (kept)
- **Objective:** Count forwards and backwards in multiples of 50, including across hundred boundaries (e.g. 350 to 400), from any starting multiple.
- **Key vocabulary:** fifty, boundary, hundred, forwards, backwards, continue
- **Lesson structure:**
  - **Starter (5 min):** "What is 50 more than 350? Show me on your whiteboard." Target the hundred boundary. Then: "50 more than 450? 50 less than 500? 50 less than 200?"
  - **Main (15 min):** Focus on the tricky transitions. Write 250, 300, 350, 400, 450 on the board. "What's happening at 300 and 400? We crossed into a new hundred!" Use the number line. Pairs: give each pair a starting number (a multiple of 50) and they must write the next 6 terms and the previous 6 terms.
  - **Practice (15 min):** Differentiated: Lower — counting in 50s from 0 with number line support. Middle — filling in sequences with missing terms, including across boundaries. Higher — "I count in 50s and say the number 750. What are three possible starting numbers?"
  - **Plenary (5 min):** Quick assessment: 5 "50 more than..." questions on whiteboards. Check for boundary errors.

## Week 2: Place Value — The Keystone

### Lesson 6 — Place Value in Three-Digit Numbers: Concrete
- **Concept ID(s):** MA-Y3-C007 (KEYSTONE)
- **Cluster:** Moved from CL002 to here (teacher decision — keystone needs earlier and more prominent placement)
- **Objective:** Identify the value of each digit in a three-digit number using Dienes blocks and place value mats.
- **Key vocabulary:** hundreds, tens, ones, place value, digit, three-digit number, value, represent
- **Lesson structure:**
  - **Starter (5 min):** "Last week we counted in 100s. Today we're going to look INSIDE these big numbers." Show 253 on the board. "This number is made of parts. Let's find out what they are."
  - **Main (20 min):** Every table has Dienes blocks and a place value mat (H | T | O columns). Model: build 253. "Two hundreds flats (200), five tens sticks (50), three ones cubes (3)." Children build 5 numbers I call out: 347, 162, 485, 219, 530. For each: "What is the [digit] worth?" Insist on full value answers: "The 4 is worth four hundred, NOT four."
  - **Practice (12 min):** Pairs: one child builds a number secretly behind a book, then describes it — "I have 3 hundreds, 6 tens, and 1 one" — partner writes the numeral. Swap roles. Record 8 numbers.
  - **Plenary (3 min):** Hold up 374 on the board. "What is the 7 worth? Convince your partner." Thumbs up when both agree.

---

### Lesson 7 — Place Value in Three-Digit Numbers: Arrow Cards
- **Concept ID(s):** MA-Y3-C007 (KEYSTONE)
- **Cluster:** Moved from CL002
- **Objective:** Compose and decompose three-digit numbers using arrow cards, bridging from concrete to pictorial representation.
- **Key vocabulary:** hundreds, tens, ones, partition, compose, decompose, arrow card, place value chart
- **Lesson structure:**
  - **Starter (5 min):** Quick recap: build 461 with Dienes. "What's the 6 worth? The 4? The 1?" Then: "Today we're going to use something faster than Dienes."
  - **Main (20 min):** Introduce arrow cards. Model: slide 300, 40, and 7 together to make 347. "Pull them apart — what do you see? The 3 was hiding the fact that it means 300!" Each child has a set. I call numbers; they build them. Then: "Now pull them apart and tell your partner the value of each digit." Introduce the place value chart as a pictorial recording tool. Children draw the chart, write the number, write each digit's value.
  - **Practice (12 min):** "Number Detective" — I give clues: "My hundreds digit is worth 500. My tens digit is worth 30. My ones digit is worth 8. What number am I?" Then children write clues for each other. Record in books.
  - **Plenary (3 min):** "Make the biggest three-digit number you can with the digits 3, 7 and 1. How do you know it's the biggest?" (Preview comparing — C009.)

---

### Lesson 8 — Place Value in Three-Digit Numbers: Zero as Placeholder
- **Concept ID(s):** MA-Y3-C007 (KEYSTONE)
- **Cluster:** Moved from CL002
- **Objective:** Understand and represent three-digit numbers with zero in the tens or ones position (e.g. 307, 460, 500).
- **Key vocabulary:** zero, placeholder, hundreds, tens, ones, nothing, empty column
- **Lesson structure:**
  - **Starter (5 min):** "Build 307 with Dienes. How many tens sticks do you need? None! So what goes in the tens column on our place value mat?" Establish: zero means "none of these."
  - **Main (20 min):** Explore: 307, 370, 703, 730, 503, 530, 500, 460, 406, 101. Build each with Dienes, record on place value chart. "Is 307 the same as 37? NO — 307 has three hundreds. 37 only has three tens." Arrow cards: try to make 307 — the tens card is 00, which is blank. "The zero holds the place so the 3 stays in the hundreds column and the 7 stays in the ones column." Target misconception: children who write 307 as "three hundred zero seven." It's "three hundred AND seven."
  - **Practice (12 min):** Worksheet: read three-digit numbers with zeros, write them in numeral form, identify digit values. "In 460, what is the value of the 0?" "Write a number where the tens digit is 0."
  - **Plenary (3 min):** Exit ticket: "Write in numerals: five hundred and three. What is the value of the 0 in your answer?"

---

### Lesson 9 — Counting in Multiples of 100
- **Concept ID(s):** MA-Y3-C004
- **Cluster:** Moved from CL001 to Week 2 (teacher decision — connects naturally to place value)
- **Objective:** Count forwards and backwards in multiples of 100 to 1000, connecting to the hundreds digit in place value.
- **Key vocabulary:** hundred, multiple of 100, three-digit number, place value, number line
- **Lesson structure:**
  - **Starter (5 min):** Stack Dienes hundred flats one at a time. "One hundred. Two hundred. Three hundred..." Count to 1000. "When we count in 100s, which digit on the place value chart changes?"
  - **Main (15 min):** Number line 0-1000 on the board, marked at each hundred. Count forwards together, then backwards (the graph warns about backward counting difficulty). "What is 100 more than 700? One more hundred flat — 800." "What is 100 less than 300? Take away one hundred flat — 200." Pairs: dice game — roll a die, multiply by 100, place on the number line.
  - **Practice (15 min):** Written: counting sequences in 100s from different starting multiples, "100 more than ___ is ___", "100 less than ___ is ___." All multiples of 100 only (no non-multiples yet — that's C006).
  - **Plenary (5 min):** "Count backwards from 1000 in 100s. What happens when we get to 0? Can we keep going?" Brief discussion — tease negative numbers for the adventurous.

---

### Lesson 10 — Reading and Writing Numbers to 1000 in Words: Introduction
- **Concept ID(s):** MA-Y3-C011 (first exposure — returning in L19)
- **Cluster:** Moved from CL004 to Week 2 (teacher decision — co-teaching signal C007 ↔ C011)
- **Objective:** Read and write multiples of 100 and straightforward three-digit numbers (no zero placeholders) in words.
- **Key vocabulary:** hundred, thousand, and, numeral, word form, write, read
- **Lesson structure:**
  - **Starter (5 min):** "We've been building numbers all week. 347 — say it out loud. Three hundred and forty-seven. Now let's learn to WRITE it in words."
  - **Main (15 min):** Teach systematically. Hundreds first: one hundred, two hundred... nine hundred. Display on working wall. Then add tens and ones: three hundred AND forty-seven. The "and" rule: it goes between the hundreds and the rest. Hyphenation: twenty-one, thirty-four, forty-seven — compound tens get a hyphen. Model 5 examples on the board, children say the word form, I write it. Then children try.
  - **Practice (15 min):** Matching activity: numeral cards on one side, word cards on the other. Match them up. Then: "Write these numbers in words: 256, 481, 139, 672." I circulate, checking for the "and" and the hyphen.
  - **Plenary (5 min):** Post the ones and teens reference chart. "Which number words are tricky? Eleven, twelve, thirteen — they don't follow the pattern. We'll practise these more in a couple of weeks."

---

## Week 3: Partitioning and More/Less

### Lesson 11 — Partitioning Three-Digit Numbers: Standard
- **Concept ID(s):** MA-Y3-C008
- **Cluster:** CL002 (kept — C007→C008 prerequisite respected)
- **Objective:** Partition any three-digit number into hundreds, tens and ones in standard form.
- **Key vocabulary:** partition, split, hundreds, tens, ones, parts, whole, standard
- **Lesson structure:**
  - **Starter (5 min):** Arrow card recap: "Make 462. Pull it apart. What do you see? 400 + 60 + 2. That's called PARTITIONING."
  - **Main (15 min):** Define partition: splitting a number into its parts. Standard partitioning: 462 = 400 + 60 + 2. Practise with Dienes first (separate the blocks), then arrow cards (pull apart), then written (462 = ___ + ___ + ___). Model 3 examples, children do 3 with support, then 4 independently. Connect to the spoken form: "four hundred AND sixty-two" — the "and" is the partition point between hundreds and tens-and-ones.
  - **Practice (15 min):** 15 partition questions, increasing difficulty. Final 3 include zero placeholders: 307 = 300 + 0 + 7. "Can we just write 300 + 7? Why?" Discuss — both are correct, but the full form shows all three columns.
  - **Plenary (5 min):** "If 583 = 500 + 80 + 3, what is 500 + 80 + 3 = ?" Confirm: partitioning goes both ways — we can split AND recombine.

---

### Lesson 12 — Partitioning Three-Digit Numbers: Flexible
- **Concept ID(s):** MA-Y3-C008
- **Cluster:** CL002 (kept)
- **Objective:** Partition three-digit numbers in non-standard (flexible) ways to support mental calculation.
- **Key vocabulary:** flexible, partition, compose, decompose, regroup, different ways
- **Lesson structure:**
  - **Starter (5 min):** "347 = 300 + 40 + 7. That's one way. Can you split it differently?" Pause for think time. Take suggestions: 300 + 47? 340 + 7? 200 + 147? "They're ALL 347!"
  - **Main (15 min):** Explore with Dienes: exchange one hundred flat for ten tens sticks. "I still have 347 cubes-worth of blocks, but now it looks different: 2 hundreds, 14 tens, 7 ones." Record: 347 = 200 + 140 + 7. Challenge: "How many different ways can you partition 253?" Table groups compete — most different correct partitions wins. Use practical problems: "I have 2 hundreds and 15 tens. What number is that?"
  - **Practice (15 min):** Differentiated: Lower — standard partitioning practice with Dienes. Middle — find 3 different ways to partition each number. Higher — "Partition 456 so that one part is a multiple of 100 and the other is less than 100" and connect to addition: "How does 456 = 400 + 56 help you add 456 + 30?"
  - **Plenary (5 min):** "Why is flexible partitioning useful?" Draw out: it helps with mental addition and subtraction. Preview: "Tomorrow we'll use place value to find 10 more and 10 less."

### Lesson 13 — Finding 10 More and 10 Less: Introduction
- **Concept ID(s):** MA-Y3-C005
- **Cluster:** CL002 (kept, but repositioned within cluster — algorithm had it alongside C007; I teach it after C008)
- **Objective:** Find 10 more and 10 less than any three-digit number where no boundary crossing is required.
- **Key vocabulary:** ten more, ten less, tens digit, increase, decrease
- **Lesson structure:**
  - **Starter (5 min):** "What is 10 more than 34? You knew that in Y2! Now: what is 10 more than 234? Which digit changed?" Establish: only the tens digit changes.
  - **Main (15 min):** Dienes blocks: build 342. Add a tens stick. "Now I have 352. Which column changed? Just the tens." Remove a tens stick from 352: "342 again. Only the tens changed." Practise with 5 numbers: 461, 527, 183, 645, 718. For each: "10 more is...? 10 less is...? Which digit changed?" Rapid-fire whiteboard work.
  - **Practice (15 min):** Written: "10 more than ___ is ___" and "10 less than ___ is ___" — 15 questions, all non-boundary. Speed challenge: how many can you do in 5 minutes? Then paired checking.
  - **Plenary (5 min):** "Does the hundreds digit ever change when we find 10 more? Hmm... what about 10 more than 190? Let's think about that tomorrow."

---

### Lesson 14 — Finding 10 More and 10 Less: Boundary Cases
- **Concept ID(s):** MA-Y3-C005
- **Cluster:** CL002 (kept)
- **Objective:** Find 10 more and 10 less than three-digit numbers where the tens digit crosses a boundary (e.g. 190 + 10 = 200, 300 - 10 = 290).
- **Key vocabulary:** ten more, ten less, boundary, exchange, hundreds digit, carry
- **Lesson structure:**
  - **Starter (5 min):** "Yesterday I asked: 10 more than 190? Show me on whiteboards." Expect some correct (200), some incorrect (1100, 1090). Don't correct yet — "Let's investigate."
  - **Main (20 min):** Dienes: build 190. "I have 1 hundred, 9 tens, 0 ones. Add a tens stick. Now I have 1 hundred and 10 tens. But 10 tens IS a hundred! Exchange." Physically swap 10 tens sticks for a hundred flat. "Now I have 2 hundreds, 0 tens, 0 ones. 200!" Repeat with 290 + 10, 396 + 10, 500 - 10, 300 - 10. Each time: build, add/remove, exchange if needed, read the new number. The graph warns about "196 + 10 = 1096" — address this explicitly.
  - **Practice (12 min):** Mixed questions: some boundary, some not. Children must identify which ones require an exchange. Traffic light: green (no exchange), amber (exchange needed). "10 more than 245 — green or amber? 10 more than 395 — green or amber?"
  - **Plenary (3 min):** "When does the hundreds digit change?" Rule: "When the tens digit is 9 and we add 10, or when the tens digit is 0 and we subtract 10."

---

### Lesson 15 — Finding 100 More and 100 Less: Introduction
- **Concept ID(s):** MA-Y3-C006
- **Cluster:** Moved from CL001 to Week 3 (teacher decision — needs place value understanding first; co-teaching signal C005 ↔ C006 supports pairing with C005)
- **Objective:** Find 100 more and 100 less than any three-digit number where no boundary crossing to four digits is required.
- **Key vocabulary:** hundred more, hundred less, hundreds digit, place value
- **Lesson structure:**
  - **Starter (5 min):** "Yesterday we found 10 more — the tens digit changed. Today: 100 more. Which digit do you think will change?" Predict, then test: "100 more than 324? Show me." (424.)
  - **Main (15 min):** Dienes: build 324. Add a hundred flat. "Now 424. Only the hundreds digit changed — tens and ones stayed the same." Side-by-side comparison on the board: 10 more changes TENS, 100 more changes HUNDREDS. Practise 8 examples: find both 10 more AND 100 more for each number. "What's the same? What's different?"
  - **Practice (15 min):** Table of numbers: for each, write 10 more, 10 less, 100 more, 100 less. Non-boundary cases only. The graph warns about changing the wrong digit (334 instead of 424) — I'll circulate and check. Extension: "I found 100 more than a number and got 567. What was my starting number?"
  - **Plenary (5 min):** "100 more than 324 is 424. 100 less than 324 is 224. What stays the same?" (24 — the tens and ones.)

## Week 4: Comparing, Ordering, and Mid-Assessment

### Lesson 16 — Finding 100 More and 100 Less: Boundary Cases
- **Concept ID(s):** MA-Y3-C006
- **Cluster:** Moved from CL001 (see L15 note)
- **Objective:** Find 100 more and 100 less including boundary cases (100 more than 900 = 1000; 100 less than 105 = 5).
- **Key vocabulary:** hundred more, hundred less, boundary, thousand, four-digit number
- **Lesson structure:**
  - **Starter (5 min):** "100 more than 900? Think carefully..." Build 900 with Dienes: 9 hundred flats. Add one more. "We have 10 hundreds. 10 hundreds IS one thousand! 1000!" Excitement moment — we've reached a four-digit number.
  - **Main (15 min):** Explore boundaries: 100 more than 900, 920, 950, 999 (this last one previews Y4). 100 less than 100 (= 0!), 105, 150, 200. Dienes throughout. "When we take away the last hundred flat, what's left? Just the tens and ones!" Discuss: 100 less than 105 = 5. "Is that right? Let's check with blocks."
  - **Practice (15 min):** Mixed worksheet: boundary and non-boundary. Include "100 more than 900 = ___", "100 less than 203 = ___", "100 less than 100 = ___". Challenge: "Can you find a number where 100 more gives you exactly 1000?"
  - **Plenary (5 min):** Review: "When does finding 100 more or less get tricky? At the boundaries!" Connect to real life: "If you had 900 stickers and got 100 more, you'd have 1000. That's one THOUSAND stickers!"

---

### Lesson 17 — Comparing and Ordering Numbers to 1000: Introduction
- **Concept ID(s):** MA-Y3-C009
- **Cluster:** CL002 (kept — C007→C009 prerequisite respected)
- **Objective:** Compare pairs of three-digit numbers using place value reasoning and the symbols >, < and =.
- **Key vocabulary:** greater than, less than, equal to, compare, symbol, >, <, =
- **Lesson structure:**
  - **Starter (5 min):** "Which is bigger: 456 or 465? Talk to your partner." Take answers and reasoning. "How did you decide?"
  - **Main (15 min):** Teach the systematic strategy: compare hundreds first. If equal, compare tens. If equal, compare ones. Model with 3 pairs on the board: 387 vs 412 (different hundreds — easy), 456 vs 465 (same hundreds, different tens), 531 vs 538 (same hundreds and tens, different ones). Introduce/revisit > and < symbols. Brief use of "crocodile eats the bigger number" then move to mathematical language. Pairs practise with digit cards: make two three-digit numbers, compare, write the statement.
  - **Practice (15 min):** Written: 12 comparison questions using < > =. Include pairs where hundreds are equal (forces tens comparison) and pairs where hundreds AND tens are equal (forces ones comparison). Use the frame: "___ ○ ___" where children write the correct symbol.
  - **Plenary (5 min):** "True or false: 509 > 510? Prove it." Check the systematic strategy is being applied.

---

### Lesson 18 — Comparing and Ordering Numbers to 1000: Ordering Sets
- **Concept ID(s):** MA-Y3-C009
- **Cluster:** CL002 (kept)
- **Objective:** Order sets of up to six three-digit numbers in ascending and descending order, explaining reasoning.
- **Key vocabulary:** order, ascending, descending, sequence, smallest, largest
- **Lesson structure:**
  - **Starter (5 min):** "Ascending means going UP — smallest to largest. Descending means going DOWN — largest to smallest." Quick check: "Put these in ascending order: 5, 2, 8, 1." Then: "Now try: 342, 287, 519."
  - **Main (15 min):** Give table groups a set of 6 number cards (e.g. 324, 387, 319, 352, 381, 309). "Put them in ascending order. Explain your strategy to the group." Observe: are they comparing hundreds first? Discuss as a class: when all the hundreds are the same (all 300s), which column decides the order? Target the misconception: comparing first digit only. Then: "Now put them in descending order. What changes?"
  - **Practice (15 min):** Three ordering tasks of increasing difficulty: (1) Numbers with different hundreds, (2) Numbers sharing a hundreds digit, (3) Mix of both plus a number line — place the numbers on a blank 0-1000 line. Reasoning: "Write one sentence explaining how you ordered the last set."
  - **Plenary (5 min):** "What's the most important digit to look at first when ordering? Why?" Consolidate the hundreds-first strategy.

---

### Lesson 19 — Reading and Writing Numbers to 1000 in Words: Tricky Cases
- **Concept ID(s):** MA-Y3-C011 (second exposure)
- **Cluster:** Moved from CL004 (teacher decision — split across Weeks 2 and 4 for spaced practice)
- **Objective:** Read and write numbers to 1000 in words including those with zero placeholders, teens, and hyphenated compound tens.
- **Key vocabulary:** hundred, and, hyphen, numeral, word form, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen
- **Lesson structure:**
  - **Starter (5 min):** "Two weeks ago we wrote numbers in words. Who remembers the rule about 'and'?" Recap: "and" goes between the hundreds and the rest. Quick: "Write 256 in words." Check for "and" and hyphen.
  - **Main (15 min):** Focus on the tricky cases. (1) Zero placeholder: "Write 307 in words. NOT 'three hundred zero seven' — it's 'three hundred and seven.'" Also 460, 500. (2) Teens: the irregulars — eleven, twelve, thirteen vs fourteen, fifteen. "Write 413 in words — four hundred and thirteen." (3) Hyphenation: twenty-one has a hyphen, thirteen does not. Drill 6 examples with the class, then paired practice.
  - **Practice (15 min):** Dictation: I say 10 numbers in words, children write the numeral. Then reverse: I display 10 numerals, children write the words. Include: 307 (zero placeholder), 515 (teens), 842 (hyphenated compound tens), 700 (round hundred). Peer marking with a red pen.
  - **Plenary (5 min):** "Write the trickiest number you can think of in words. Swap with your partner — can they write the numeral?" Celebrate good examples.

## Week 5: Counting in 8s, Estimation, and Deepening

### Lesson 21 — Counting in Multiples of 8: The Doubling Connection
- **Concept ID(s):** MA-Y3-C002
- **Cluster:** CL004 (kept — C001→C002 prerequisite respected, spaced from C001 in Week 1)
- **Objective:** Count forwards in multiples of 8 to at least 96, using the doubling relationship with multiples of 4.
- **Key vocabulary:** multiple, count in eights, eight times table, doubling, sequence
- **Lesson structure:**
  - **Starter (5 min):** "Count in 4s to 48. Good — you remember from Week 1! Now watch..." Write 4s on one row: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48. "What is double 4? 8. Double 8? 16. Double 12? 24." Write the 8s underneath: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48. "The 8 times table is the 4 times table DOUBLED!"
  - **Main (15 min):** Concrete: make groups of 8 cubes (or use pictures of spiders — 8 legs each! Cross-curricular with our mini-beasts science topic). Count: 8, 16, 24, 32... Number line with 8s highlighted. Practise counting together to 80. Focus on the tricky transitions the graph flags: 32 → 40 (feels like a big jump) and 72 → 80.
  - **Practice (15 min):** Sequence completion: 8, 16, __, __, 40, __, __. "True or false: 36 is a multiple of 8." "What is the 5th multiple of 8?" Number line: place the multiples of 8 on a 0-100 line.
  - **Plenary (5 min):** Choral count in 8s to 80. "What patterns do you notice in the ones digits?" (8, 6, 4, 2, 0, 8, 6, 4, 2, 0 — a decreasing-by-2 pattern!)

---

### Lesson 22 — Counting in Multiples of 8: Practice from Any Point
- **Concept ID(s):** MA-Y3-C002
- **Cluster:** CL004 (kept)
- **Objective:** Count forwards and backwards in multiples of 8 from any given multiple.
- **Key vocabulary:** multiple, forwards, backwards, continue, sequence, eight times table
- **Lesson structure:**
  - **Starter (5 min):** "Start at 32. Count forwards in 8s. 40, 48, 56, 64..." "Now start at 72. Count backwards. 64, 56, 48..." Fast-paced, whole class.
  - **Main (15 min):** Pairs activity: "8s Tennis" — same as the 4s Ping-Pong game but harder. One says a multiple of 8, partner says the next. Then backwards. Scaffolding for those who struggle: a number line with 8s marked, or a multiplication grid to refer to. Focus on the error-prone transitions: deliberately start counts at 24, 64 to force the tricky jumps.
  - **Practice (15 min):** Written: continue sequences from mid-points, fill in missing multiples, "Count back from 96 in 8s: 96, __, __, __, 64, __, __." Challenge: "I counted in 8s and said the number 56. What are two possible numbers I started from?"
  - **Plenary (5 min):** Quick assessment: "Show me on your whiteboard — what is the next multiple of 8 after 48? After 72? Before 40?" Check for fluency.

---

### Lesson 23 — Counting in Multiples of 8: Fluency and Application
- **Concept ID(s):** MA-Y3-C002
- **Cluster:** CL004 (kept)
- **Objective:** Apply counting in multiples of 8 fluently to solve problems, connecting to multiplication.
- **Key vocabulary:** multiple, eight times table, groups of, lots of, total
- **Lesson structure:**
  - **Starter (5 min):** Speed challenge: write as many multiples of 8 as you can in 60 seconds. Compare with yesterday — are you faster?
  - **Main (15 min):** Application problems: "A spider has 8 legs. How many legs do 6 spiders have? How did you work it out?" (Count in 8s six times, or 6 × 8 = 48.) "Octopus arms: 8 per octopus. I counted 40 arms. How many octopuses?" (Count in 8s to 40 — that's 5.) "Egg boxes hold 8 eggs. I need 50 eggs. How many boxes?" (Count in 8s past 50: 48 is 6 boxes, not enough; need 7 boxes.) Discuss: this is multiplication and division using counting.
  - **Practice (15 min):** 8 word problems using counting in 8s. Differentiated: lower — use number line, problems use smaller numbers. Higher — problems involve reasoning ("I have some groups of 8 and some groups of 4. I have 36 cubes in total. What could my groups be?").
  - **Plenary (5 min):** "After half-term, we'll learn the times tables properly. But you've already started — you can count in 4s and 8s! That IS the 4 and 8 times tables."

---

### Lesson 24 — Estimating Numbers to 1000: Benchmarks and Reasoning
- **Concept ID(s):** MA-Y3-C010
- **Cluster:** CL004 (kept — C009→C010 prerequisite respected)
- **Objective:** Estimate where numbers appear on a partially labelled number line using benchmark reasoning (midpoints, quarter-points).
- **Key vocabulary:** estimate, approximately, about, roughly, reasonable, benchmark, halfway, number line
- **Lesson structure:**
  - **Starter (5 min):** "An estimate is NOT a guess. A guess is random. An estimate uses CLUES. Today we're going to become estimation detectives." Show a jar of cubes. "About how many? How did you decide?" Take reasoning, not just numbers.
  - **Main (20 min):** Large washing-line number line: 0 on the left, 1000 on the right, nothing else marked. "Where does 500 go?" (Halfway.) Peg it. "Where does 250 go?" (Halfway between 0 and 500.) "Where does 750?" "Now: where does 400 go? How do you know?" Teach: use benchmarks. 400 is between 250 and 500, but closer to 500. Demonstrate with 5 numbers. Then: point to a position on the line. "What number do you think this is? Explain your reasoning."
  - **Practice (12 min):** Worksheet: partially labelled number lines (different scales — 0-1000, 0-500, 200-600). For each: identify the number at the arrow, OR place a given number on the line. Must write one sentence of reasoning.
  - **Plenary (3 min):** "Is 'about 700' a good estimate for this position? Convince me." Reinforce: estimation is about reasonable reasoning.

---

### Lesson 25 — Estimating Numbers to 1000: Varied Representations
- **Concept ID(s):** MA-Y3-C010
- **Cluster:** CL004 (kept)
- **Objective:** Estimate quantities and positions in varied contexts, improving reasoning and use of benchmarks.
- **Key vocabulary:** estimate, approximately, benchmark, reasonable, justify
- **Lesson structure:**
  - **Starter (5 min):** "Estimate how many children are in the hall at lunchtime." (Whole school ~420.) "How did you decide? Did you count? Or did you use what you KNOW?"
  - **Main (15 min):** Three estimation stations (5 min each, rotate): (1) Zoomed-in number lines (300-400, with arrow — estimate to nearest 10). (2) Jars of objects — estimate the quantity, then count to check. Discuss: how close were you? (3) Images: a crowd photo, a pile of books, a bag of sweets — estimate quantities using benchmark reasoning ("I can see about 10 in this group, and there are about 8 groups, so about 80").
  - **Practice (15 min):** Written: 8 estimation questions across number lines and quantity estimation. Must include reasoning. "Explain why your estimate is reasonable." Differentiated: lower — number lines marked with more benchmarks. Higher — number lines from 0-2000 or with unusual scales.
  - **Plenary (5 min):** "What makes someone a good estimator?" Class list: uses benchmarks, thinks about halfway, checks if the answer makes sense, doesn't just guess. "You're all much better estimators than you were on Monday!"

- **Key vocabulary:** estimate, approximately, benchmark, scale, reasonable, improve
- **Lesson structure:**
  - **Starter (5 min):** Estimation warm-up: "Show me on your whiteboard where you think 380 goes on this 0-1000 line." Discuss positioning. "Now where is 620? And 815?"
  - **Main (15 min):** Focus on measurement contexts: reading scales marked in different intervals. A weighing scale marked at 0g and 500g — the arrow points to about 200g. "How did you estimate?" A measuring jug marked at 0ml and 1000ml — the water is at about 700ml. "Use the benchmarks!" A ruler marked at 0cm and 100cm — where is 45cm? These link estimation to measurement (coming later this term in a different unit).
  - **Practice (15 min):** Estimation challenge: 10 questions mixing number lines, scales, and quantities. Children work independently, then discuss answers with a partner. Focus on: "Was your estimate reasonable? How could you make it more accurate?"
  - **Plenary (5 min):** "Next year, you'll learn to ROUND numbers to the nearest 10 and 100. Estimation is the first step — you're already doing it! When you estimate '750 is about 750', that's basically rounding."

### Lesson 27 — Problem-Solving: Place Value Challenges
- **Concept ID(s):** MA-Y3-C007, MA-Y3-C008, MA-Y3-C009, MA-Y3-C011

- **Objective:** Apply place value, partitioning, comparing, and number word knowledge to solve multi-step reasoning problems.
- **Key vocabulary:** All place value vocabulary
- **Lesson structure:**
  - **Starter (5 min):** "I think of a number. It has 5 hundreds, 3 tens and 7 ones. What is my number? Now write it in words." (Five hundred and thirty-seven.) Quick warm-up.
  - **Main (20 min):** Group challenge — 4 problems, one per table group, rotate every 5 minutes:
    1. "I think of a three-digit number. The hundreds digit is double the ones digit. The tens digit is 5. The number is greater than 500. What could my number be?" (652, 854)
    2. "Find all the three-digit numbers you can make using the digits 3, 0 and 7. Order them from smallest to largest." (307, 370, 703, 730 — note: 037 and 073 aren't three-digit)
    3. "True or false: 100 more than 405 is greater than 100 less than 610? Prove it." (505 vs 510 — false!)
    4. "I partitioned my number into 400 + 130 + 6. What is my number? Write it in standard partition form." (536 = 500 + 30 + 6)
  - **Practice (12 min):** Groups present their solutions to the class. Discuss strategies and reasoning.
  - **Plenary (3 min):** "Which problem was hardest? Why? What maths did you need to use?"

### Lesson 28 — Problem-Solving: Counting and Estimation Challenges
- **Concept ID(s):** MA-Y3-C001, MA-Y3-C002, MA-Y3-C003, MA-Y3-C004, MA-Y3-C010
- **Cluster:** Consolidation (teacher addition)
- **Objective:** Apply counting in multiples and estimation skills to solve practical and reasoning problems.
- **Key vocabulary:** All counting and estimation vocabulary
- **Lesson structure:**
  - **Starter (5 min):** "Quick fire! Count in 4s from 20. Count in 8s from 40. Count in 50s from 300. Count in 100s backwards from 800."
  - **Main (20 min):** Problem-solving carousel:
    1. "I counted in 4s and landed on 36. I also counted in 8s and landed on 36. Why does this work?" (36 is a multiple of both 4 and 8 because 8 is double 4)
    2. "50p coins: I have seven. How much money? I spend £2. How many coins left? Did you count in 50s?" (£3.50; £1.50 left = 3 coins)
    3. Estimation relay: each group gets a different partially labelled number line. Estimate 5 numbers, write reasoning. Most reasonable estimates (judged by the class) win.
    4. "A number is a multiple of 8 and is between 45 and 70. What could it be?" (48, 56, 64)
  - **Practice (12 min):** Independent write-up: choose your best problem from the carousel, write the solution with full reasoning in your book.
  - **Plenary (3 min):** "What maths from this half-term did you use today? How many different concepts?" Count them together.

- **Objective:** Address specific misconceptions identified in the end-of-unit assessment; extend secure learners.
- **Key vocabulary:** Varies by group
- **Lesson structure:**
  - **Starter (5 min):** General feedback on the assessment. "I was really impressed by... A lot of you found Q__ tricky. We're going to work on that today."
  - **Main (30 min):** Three groups, running simultaneously:
    - **Intervention group** (TA-led, ~8 children): Place value and partitioning — Dienes blocks, arrow cards, targeted practice on the misconceptions identified in their papers. Focus on C007 digit-vs-value confusion and C008 flexible partitioning.
    - **Consolidation group** (independent, ~12 children): Maths games reinforcing the domain. "Place Value Top Trumps" (make the biggest/smallest number with 3 digit cards), "Estimation Station" (estimate and check quantities), "100 More/Less Bingo." Games are self-checking.
    - **Extension group** (teacher-led, ~8 children): Four-digit place value (preview Y4) — what does the thousands column look like? OR: Roman numerals to 100 (Y4 content). OR: ordering numbers beyond 1000.
  - **Plenary (5 min):** Whole class. "What was the most important thing you learned this half-term about numbers?" Take 5-6 responses. "After half-term, we'll use everything you've learned about place value to help with addition and subtraction. You're ready!"
