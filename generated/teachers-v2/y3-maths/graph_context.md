## Domain: Number - Number and Place Value (MA-Y3-D001)

- **Subject**: Mathematics
- **Year**: Y3
- **Structure type**: hierarchical

**Curriculum context**: In lower key stage 2, the principal focus of mathematics teaching is to ensure that pupils become increasingly fluent with whole numbers and the four operations, including number facts and the concept of place value. In Year 3, pupils extend their understanding of the number system from two-digit numbers (explored in KS1) to three-digit numbers, developing secure knowledge of the hundreds, tens and ones structure. The non-statutory guidance emphasises that pupils should use a variety of represen

#### MA-Y3-C001: Counting in multiples of 4

**Description**: Counting in multiples of 4 (4, 8, 12, 16, 20...) builds on counting in twos from KS1 and prepares pupils for the 4 times table. Pupils must be able to count forwards and backwards in fours from any multiple of four, not just from zero. Mastery means a pupil can continue or start a count in fours from any given multiple without needing to recite the sequence from the beginning, and can connect counting in fours to the doubling relationship with twos.

**Teaching guidance**: Begin with concrete groups of 4 objects (four counting bears, four cubes) physically grouped and counted. Use a number line or hundred square with multiples of 4 highlighted to provide a pictorial representation. Connect explicitly to the 2 times table: 'double 2 is 4, so counting in fours is like counting in twos twice.' Practise from different starting points (not always from zero) and in both directions. Use chanting and rhythmic counting, but ensure pupils can also respond to 'what comes after 28?' without reciting from the start.

**Key vocabulary**: multiple, count in fours, four times table, skip count, sequence, pattern

**Common misconceptions**: Pupils often count in fours confidently starting from zero but stumble when asked to continue from a mid-sequence multiple (e.g. 'keep counting from 20'). Some pupils confuse multiples of 4 with multiples of 2 and say 2, 4, 6 when asked to count in fours. When counting backwards in fours, pupils frequently revert to counting back in ones.


#### MA-Y3-C002: Counting in multiples of 8

**Description**: Counting in multiples of 8 (8, 16, 24, 32...) is the most challenging skip-counting sequence introduced in Year 3 and is directly connected to the 8 times table. Pupils must be able to count forwards and backwards in eights from any multiple. Mastery means a pupil can recite the sequence fluently, continue it from any starting multiple, and understand the doubling relationship linking the 4 and 8 times tables.

**Teaching guidance**: Use the doubling connection: first consolidate counting in fours, then demonstrate that each multiple of 8 is double the corresponding multiple of 4 (4 → 8, 8 → 16, 12 → 24). A number line showing multiples of 4 with the multiples of 8 highlighted makes this relationship visual. Repeated doubling (starting from 1: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64...) is a powerful pattern to explore. Use contexts where 8 is natural: spiders' legs, octopus arms, 8-shaped athletics tracks.

**Key vocabulary**: multiple, count in eights, eight times table, skip count, doubling, sequence

**Common misconceptions**: Counting in eights is hard because the multiples (8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80...) do not have as obvious a visual pattern on a hundred square as multiples of 5 or 10. Pupils frequently lose their place in the sequence and resort to counting in ones. The transition from 32 to 40 and from 72 to 80 are particularly error-prone.


#### MA-Y3-C003: Counting in multiples of 50

**Description**: Counting in multiples of 50 (50, 100, 150, 200...) connects to the 5 times table and understanding of amounts on scales and in money. Pupils must count forwards and backwards in 50s beyond 1000 if needed. Mastery means a pupil can count fluently in 50s from different starting points and connect this to reading scale marks on measurement instruments showing 50ml, 50g, 50cm etc.

**Teaching guidance**: Connect to the 5 times table: 5 × 10 = 50, so each multiple of 50 is a multiple of 5 scaled by 10. Use a number line marked in 50s. Connect to money (50p coins, £1 = two 50p coins) and measurement contexts (a weighing scale with 50g gradations). Show that counting in 50s is like counting in 5s but with an extra zero on the end of each number. Practise in both directions: 200, 150, 100, 50, 0.

**Key vocabulary**: fifty, multiple, count in fifties, sequence, scale

**Common misconceptions**: Pupils sometimes say 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 310 (adding only 10 at some points). The transition across hundreds boundaries (e.g. 350, 400) occasionally causes pupils to add only 50 to the tens digit rather than to the whole number.


#### MA-Y3-C004: Counting in multiples of 100

**Description**: Counting in multiples of 100 (100, 200, 300...) reinforces the structure of the number system and the hundreds place in place value. Pupils must count fluently forwards and backwards in hundreds up to at least 1000. Mastery means a pupil can count in hundreds without hesitation, identify any given multiple of 100 on a number line, and connect this to the hundreds digit in three-digit numbers.

**Teaching guidance**: Connect to the understanding of hundreds as a unit. Use a number line from 0 to 1000 marked in hundreds. Use Dienes/base-ten blocks: each flat (hundred block) represents one 100. Count the blocks as they are added or removed. Connect to knowledge of the 10 times table: 10 × 10 = 100, so multiples of 100 are multiples of the 10 times table scaled by 10.

**Key vocabulary**: hundred, multiple of 100, three-digit number, place value, number line

**Common misconceptions**: Most pupils count in hundreds easily from zero, but may struggle to count backward (1000, 900, 800...) particularly across the 0 boundary. Some pupils believe you cannot count below zero in hundreds, not knowing about negative numbers. When asked for 100 more than 950, some pupils say 1050 incorrectly (adding an extra zero) rather than 1050 correctly.


#### MA-Y3-C005: Finding 10 more and 10 less

**Description**: Finding 10 more or 10 less than any given three-digit number requires understanding that only the tens digit changes (e.g. 246 + 10 = 256). This extends the KS1 skill of finding 10 more/less with two-digit numbers to the three-digit range. Mastery means a pupil can instantly identify 10 more/less than any three-digit number, including those where the tens digit reaches 0 or 9 (requiring the hundreds digit to change).

**Teaching guidance**: Use a 0-1000 number line with clear decade markings. Dienes blocks are powerful: adding a ten-stick shows the change physically. A hundred square extended to show three-digit numbers helps pupils see the pattern. Focus on the boundary cases: 10 more than 190 is 200 (the tens digit overflows into the hundreds); 10 less than 200 is 190 (borrowing from the hundreds). Practise with rapid-fire questions.

**Key vocabulary**: ten more, ten less, tens digit, hundreds digit, increase, decrease, partition

**Common misconceptions**: When the tens digit is 9, pupils often say 10 more than 196 is 1096 (adding a 1 in front) or 196 + 10 = 1,106. When the tens digit is 0, pupils may say 10 less than 300 is 390 rather than 290. These boundary errors reveal incomplete understanding of how carrying and borrowing work with hundreds.


#### MA-Y3-C006: Finding 100 more and 100 less

**Description**: Finding 100 more or 100 less than any three-digit number requires understanding that only the hundreds digit changes (e.g. 346 + 100 = 446). This extends directly from finding 10 more/less by one column of place value. Mastery means a pupil can instantly identify 100 more or 100 less, including at boundaries such as 100 more than 900 = 1000.

**Teaching guidance**: Use Dienes blocks: adding a hundreds flat to a three-digit number shows the change physically. Connect to the hundred square pattern (one row down = 10 more; one full square = 100 more conceptually). Emphasise that the tens and ones digits do not change. Target the boundary: 100 more than 900 crosses into four digits (1000), which is an exciting moment to discuss. Practise in both directions.

**Key vocabulary**: hundred more, hundred less, hundreds digit, partition, place value, boundary

**Common misconceptions**: Pupils often change the wrong digit: for 100 more than 324, some say 424 (correct) but others say 334 (changed tens) or 325 (changed ones). The boundary case of 100 more than 900 = 1000 can confuse pupils who think four-digit numbers do not exist yet.


#### MA-Y3-C007: Place value in three-digit numbers

**Description**: Understanding that each digit in a three-digit number has a specific value determined by its position — hundreds, tens or ones — is the core of place value for Year 3. For example, in 347, the 3 represents 300, the 4 represents 40 and the 7 represents 7. Mastery means pupils can identify the value of any digit in a three-digit number, partition the number in standard form (347 = 300 + 40 + 7), and use this understanding to support all calculation strategies.

**Teaching guidance**: Use base-ten (Dienes) blocks as the primary concrete resource: hundreds flats, tens sticks and ones cubes model each place value position physically. Place value mats with columns for H, T and O support structured partitioning. Arrow cards (separate cards for 300, 40, 7 that slot together to form 347) show how digits combine and separate. Progress to place value charts and then to abstract representation. Always connect to the spoken number name.

**Key vocabulary**: hundreds, tens, ones, units, place value, digit, three-digit number, partition, value, represent

**Common misconceptions**: Pupils frequently confuse the digit with its value — saying the digit 3 in 347 'is worth 3' rather than 300. Pupils with insecure understanding may add the digits (3 + 4 + 7 = 14) rather than partitioning them. Zero as a place holder causes particular difficulty: in 307, the zero means 'no tens', but pupils often omit it when writing the number or misread it as 37.


#### MA-Y3-C008: Partitioning three-digit numbers

**Description**: Partitioning is the process of splitting a number into its component parts according to place value (e.g. 347 = 300 + 40 + 7). In Year 3, pupils extend this from two-digit to three-digit numbers and also practise flexible (non-standard) partitioning (e.g. 347 = 300 + 47 or 270 + 77). Mastery means pupils can partition any three-digit number in multiple ways and use partitioning as a mental calculation strategy.

**Teaching guidance**: Arrow cards and Dienes blocks remain the most powerful tools. After establishing standard partitioning, introduce flexible partitioning through practical problems: if I have 3 hundreds and 14 tens, what number is that? Discuss: 3 hundreds and 14 tens = 3 hundreds + 1 hundred + 4 tens = 4 hundreds + 4 tens = 440. Flexible partitioning is directly needed for mental addition and subtraction strategies, so teaching it in that context makes the purpose clear.

**Key vocabulary**: partition, split, hundreds, tens, ones, standard, flexible, parts, whole, compose, decompose

**Common misconceptions**: Pupils can usually do standard partitioning but struggle with flexible partitioning (e.g. they cannot see that 347 = 300 + 47 = 250 + 97). They may also partition in writing but not connect it to mental arithmetic strategies. Some pupils think each partition is a different number rather than different ways of expressing the same number.


#### MA-Y3-C009: Comparing and ordering numbers to 1000

**Description**: Comparing numbers to 1000 involves using the language and symbols of inequality (greater than >, less than <, equal to =) to express the relationship between pairs of numbers. Ordering extends this to arranging multiple numbers in ascending or descending sequence. Mastery means pupils can compare any two three-digit numbers and explain their reasoning using place value, and can order sets of up to six numbers to 1000.

**Teaching guidance**: Use a number line from 0 to 1000 as the primary visual tool — the relative positions of numbers on the line make their order evident. Teach pupils to compare hundreds digits first, then tens, then ones — a systematic strategy. Use symbols > and < with the 'hungry crocodile always eats the bigger number' mnemonic if helpful, but ensure understanding precedes the symbol. Present numbers in random order and ask pupils to arrange them, explaining their reasoning aloud.

**Key vocabulary**: greater than, less than, equal to, compare, order, ascending, descending, sequence, symbol, >, <, =

**Common misconceptions**: Pupils sometimes compare by number of digits only (correctly seeing 999 > 100) but then fail when all numbers have the same number of digits (comparing 456 and 465). They may compare the first digits correctly then stop, not realising they need to move to the next column when the hundreds are equal. The symbols > and < are frequently confused with each other.


#### MA-Y3-C010: Estimating numbers to 1000

**Description**: Estimation of numbers involves making a sensible approximation of a quantity or position based on available information, without precise counting. In Year 3, this includes estimating where a number appears on a partly-labelled number line and estimating quantities shown in images. Mastery means a pupil can give a reasonable estimate with appropriate reasoning (e.g. 'It's about halfway between 400 and 500, so I estimate 450') and understands that an estimate is not a guess.

**Teaching guidance**: Use partially labelled number lines (e.g. marked only at 0 and 1000, or at 0, 500 and 1000) and ask pupils to place numbers on them or identify values at marked positions. Compare estimation skills with measurement contexts — estimation is used before measuring to check for reasonableness. Discuss what makes a good estimate and how to improve the process (using benchmarks like halfway points). Connect to rounding in Year 4: estimation to the nearest 100 or 10 is the precursor.

**Key vocabulary**: estimate, approximately, about, roughly, nearly, reasonable, benchmark, halfway, number line

**Common misconceptions**: Pupils confuse estimation with guessing (no reasoning involved) or with an exact answer (too precise). They may estimate numbers on a 0-1000 number line without using known benchmarks (e.g. not using the midpoint 500 as an anchor). Some pupils are reluctant to estimate because they feel they might be wrong, not understanding that a reasonable estimate is always acceptable.


#### MA-Y3-C011: Reading and writing numbers to 1000 in words

**Description**: Pupils must be able to read and write in words any number up to 1000, including those with zero in a place value position (e.g. three hundred and seven, four hundred and fifty). Mastery means a pupil can convert fluently between numeral and word forms in both directions without errors, applying appropriate hyphenation and the word 'and' correctly.

**Teaching guidance**: Build systematically from hundreds: 'three hundred', then 'three hundred and forty', then 'three hundred and forty-seven'. Teach the rule that 'and' appears between hundreds and the rest (British English convention). Highlight hyphenation for compound tens (twenty-one, forty-seven). Special attention to 'eleven' through 'nineteen' as these are irregular. Post a reference chart of ones and teens words. Zero in the tens place requires 'and [ones]' (three hundred and seven, not three hundred and zero seven).

**Key vocabulary**: hundred, thousand, and, hyphen, numeral, word form, spell, write, read

**Common misconceptions**: Pupils frequently omit 'and' (writing 'three hundred forty-seven' rather than 'three hundred and forty-seven'). They may write the number of hundreds as a single digit prefix ('3 hundred forty-seven'). Numbers with zero in the tens column cause particular confusion: some write 'three hundred zero seven' or omit the zero entirely and write 'three hundred seven' which is ambiguous.
