# Mrs Chapman's Planning Journal
## Year 3 Number and Place Value — Autumn 1

*6 weeks, 30 lessons (~45 min each)*
*Two-form entry primary. Mixed-ability class of 30. Around half came through our own Y2, half from a neighbouring infant school, so prior attainment is uneven.*

## First Reaction to the Cluster Scaffold

Right. Four clusters, 33 allocated lessons (I have 30), and the first thing that jumps out is that **CL002 and CL003 list identical concepts**. Finding 10 more/less, place value, partitioning, comparing/ordering appear in both the PRACTICE cluster and the ASSESSMENT cluster. I think the algorithm has duplicated rather than separated — CL003 is meant to be the assessment and consolidation phase for CL002's concepts, not a re-teaching block. That makes sense once I read it that way, but it did confuse me at first glance.

The second thing I notice: **CL001 puts Finding 100 more and 100 less (C006) before the keystone concept Place value in three-digit numbers (C007)**. The prerequisite chain shows C004 → C006 (counting in 100s feeds into 100 more/less) but there's no explicit arrow from C007 → C006. However, the co-teaching signal shows C007 ↔ C006 — they belong together. And honestly, from a teaching perspective, you cannot confidently find 100 more than 347 unless you understand what the hundreds digit represents. So the algorithm is technically following the prerequisite chain, but it's missing implicit pedagogical dependency. **I'm moving C006 to after C007.**

Third observation: **the algorithm separates C001 (counting in 4s) from C002 (counting in 8s) entirely** — 4s in CL001, 8s in CL004. The prerequisite chain (C001 → C002) justifies this: you need fluency in 4s before you double into 8s. I actually agree with this separation. In White Rose and Power Maths, the 8 times table is explicitly taught as "double the 4 times table", and the gap between them lets the 4s embed properly. Good call, algorithm.

Fourth: **C011 (reading and writing in words) is placed in the final cluster.** This surprises me. I'd normally introduce number words alongside place value — when children are making 347 with Dienes blocks and saying "three hundred and forty-seven", the natural next step is writing it. The co-teaching signal agrees: C007 ↔ C011. I'm going to split C011: introduce it during my place value week and return to practise tricky cases later.

Fifth: **C010 (estimating to 1000) is at the end, with complexity 3 and weight 3.** This is right. Estimation is genuinely the hardest concept here because it requires synthesising place value understanding with number line reasoning and then making a judgement. It needs comparing/ordering as a prerequisite (C009 → C010). I'm keeping it late.

Overall: the algorithm gives me a reasonable skeleton — counting first, place value core in the middle, harder concepts at the end — but the specific groupings within clusters need teacher rearrangement. The scaffold saved me from starting with a blank page, but I wouldn't teach it as-is.

## Specific Grouping Decisions

### What I'm keeping from the algorithm

**Counting multiples as the opening move (from CL001).** I actually debated this. Many schemes start with place value. But September Y3 children have just arrived in KS2, often in a new building, and counting is familiar and confidence-building. Counting in 4s and 50s connects directly to their Y2 experience (counting in 2s, 3s, 5s — see external prerequisite MA-Y2-C001 → MA-Y3-C001). Starting with something they can do and extending it is good transition pedagogy. The algorithm's instinct here is sound.

**Counting in 8s (C002) at the end (from CL004).** Weight 3, complexity 3. The prerequisite chain (C001 → C002) means 4s must be secure first, and the teaching guidance says to use the doubling connection explicitly. Leaving a 2-3 week gap between 4s and 8s gives the 4s time to embed in long-term memory (spaced practice). This is actually better than teaching them back-to-back, which most schemes do.

**Estimating (C010) as one of the final concepts (from CL004).** Complexity 3, weight 3, prerequisite from C009. It requires children to have a secure mental number line, which they can only build after place value and comparing/ordering. Correct placement.

**Place value (C007) before partitioning (C008) and comparing (C009).** The prerequisite chain is explicit: C007 → C008 and C007 → C009. No argument here.

### What I'm rearranging

**Moving C006 (Finding 100 more/less) out of CL001 and into Week 3.** As discussed above, children need to understand what the hundreds digit IS before they can add or subtract 100 from a number. The algorithm placed it in CL001 because the only explicit prerequisite is C004 (counting in 100s), but the implicit dependency on place value understanding is strong. I'll teach C004 (counting in 100s) in Week 2 right after place value, and C006 in Week 3 alongside C005 (finding 10 more/less). This pairs them naturally: "finding 10 more" and "finding 100 more" use the same reasoning at different place value columns.

**Splitting C011 (reading/writing in words) across two lessons in different weeks.** The algorithm puts it entirely in CL004. I'm introducing it in Week 2 (L10), right after place value, because saying and writing number names is part of understanding three-digit numbers. Then I'll return to it in Week 4 (L19) for the tricky cases — zero as placeholder, compound tens, the "and" convention. The co-teaching signal C007 ↔ C011 supports this: they belong together pedagogically.

**Redistributing CL002/CL003.** Since these list the same four concepts, I'm treating CL002 as the teaching block and CL003 as the assessment point. But I'm spreading those four concepts (C005, C007, C008, C009) across Weeks 2-4 rather than cramming them into two dense blocks. The weight values (C005: 2, C007: 3, C008: 2, C009: 2 = total 9 lessons) need space to breathe.

**Adding a Y2 recap lesson.** The external prerequisites show six links back to Y2. These children, especially the ones from the other school, need a lesson confirming they can count in 2s, 5s, 10s, understand two-digit place value, and use < > = symbols. I'm using Lesson 1 for this. The algorithm doesn't account for transition, which is fair enough — it's working from the concept graph, not the school calendar.

### Merging within lessons

Some concepts will share a lesson. Specifically:

- **C004 (counting in 100s, weight 1) gets one lesson, shared partly with C007 setup.** Weight 1 means it's low-demand. I'll use counting in 100s as the concrete entry point into place value: "We've been counting in 100s: 100, 200, 300... now let's look at what happens BETWEEN those hundreds." This creates a bridge from CL001 into the keystone.

- **C005 and C006 (10 more/less and 100 more/less) will be taught in parallel in Weeks 3.** The co-teaching signal C005 ↔ C006 supports this. I'll teach 10 more/less first (two lessons), then 100 more/less (two lessons), with explicit comparison: "When we found 10 more, which digit changed? When we found 100 more, which digit changed?" This reinforces place value columns.

---

## How Keystone and Prerequisite Data Helped

**C007 (Place value in three-digit numbers) is flagged as the only keystone.** This confirmed what I already felt: place value is THE concept this half-term. Everything else either leads to it or builds from it. The prerequisite fan-out from C007 goes to C008, C009 (and transitively to C010). The co-teaching signals show C007 connecting to C001, C004, C005, C006, C008, C009, C011 — that's 7 of the other 10 concepts. It's the hub of the whole domain.

Knowing it's a keystone made me **allocate three full lessons to it** (matching weight 3) and **place the mid-unit assessment immediately after the concepts that depend on it**. If children don't secure place value, nothing else works. The assessment at Lesson 20 checks C007, C008, C009 — the keystone and its two direct dependants.

The **prerequisite chain** C007 → C008 → (used in) C009 → C010 gave me a clear left-to-right sequence for Weeks 2-5. I didn't have to guess the order; the graph told me. And the external prerequisite MA-Y2-C007 (inverse relationship, addition/subtraction) → C007 reminded me that some children may not have secure addition/subtraction to 100, which would undermine their place value understanding. That goes on my "things to check in the recap lesson" list.

The **prerequisite fan-out** data (how many other concepts depend on each one) would have been useful to see numerically. C007 has fan-out of at least 2 directly (C008, C009) and more transitively. C001 has fan-out of 1 (C002). This tells me where the high-stakes teaching moments are: get C007 wrong and half the unit collapses; get C001 slightly wobbly and only C002 suffers.

## Assessment and Consolidation Placement

The algorithm suggests an ASSESSMENT cluster (CL003) after CL002. I'm using two assessment points instead of one:

1. **Lesson 20 (end of Week 4): Mid-unit assessment.** Covers place value (C007), partitioning (C008), comparing/ordering (C009), finding 10/100 more and less (C005, C006), and reading/writing in words (C011). This is the keystone assessment — if children aren't secure here, I need Week 5 for intervention before moving to harder concepts. This aligns with the algorithm's CL003 intent.

2. **Lesson 29 (Week 6): End-of-unit assessment.** Covers everything, including the later concepts: counting in 8s (C002), estimating (C010), and problem-solving across the domain.

3. **Lesson 30: Targeted intervention / extension.** Based on the Lesson 29 assessment. Children who need more time with C007/C008 get small-group support. Children who are secure get extension into four-digit numbers or Roman numerals (previewing Y4).

The algorithm's consolidation suggestion (roughly 20% of lessons) translates to 6 out of 30 lessons. My plan has: L1 (recap), L20 (assessment), L27-28 (problem-solving), L29 (assessment), L30 (intervention) = 5 explicit consolidation/assessment lessons, plus the second lesson on each concept serves as consolidation of the first. That feels about right. I might have slightly under-allocated pure consolidation, but the problem-solving lessons in Week 6 serve double duty.

---

## CPA Progression and Teaching Decisions

### Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract across the half-term

**Week 1 (Counting):** Concrete — physical groups of objects (4 bears, 50p coins). Pictorial — highlighted hundred squares, number lines. Abstract by lesson 5 — verbal counting from any starting point.

**Week 2 (Place value):** Heavily concrete — Dienes blocks are out for the whole week. Every child needs access to a set. Place value mats with H/T/O columns. Arrow cards for the "slot together" effect. Pictorial — place value charts, bar models showing partitioning. Abstract only for C004 (counting in 100s), which is low complexity.

**Week 3 (Partitioning, 10/100 more and less):** Concrete → Pictorial transition. Still using Dienes but increasingly asking children to draw the blocks rather than handle them. "Sketch what 10 more looks like" before doing it abstractly. The boundary cases (10 more than 190, 100 more than 900) need concrete support even for higher attainers.

**Week 4 (Comparing, ordering, words):** Mostly pictorial → abstract. Number lines for comparing. Writing number words is inherently abstract. But I'll keep Dienes available for children who need to "see" which number is bigger.

**Week 5 (8s, estimating):** Mixed. Counting in 8s benefits from concrete (groups of 8 objects) early, then pictorial (number line). Estimation is pictorial by nature (number lines) but requires abstract reasoning.

**Week 6 (Problem-solving, assessment):** Fully abstract for most children. Concrete resources available on request.

### Manipulatives plan

- **Dienes (base-ten) blocks**: Weeks 1-4, especially Weeks 2-3. Every table needs a set. I'll ask the maths lead if we can borrow Y4's sets during their geometry unit.
- **Arrow cards**: Weeks 2-3 for place value and partitioning. I have a class set from last year.
- **Place value mats**: Weeks 2-4. Laminated, with dry-wipe markers.
- **Hundred squares**: Weeks 1 and 5 for counting patterns. Enlarged to A3 for table groups.
- **Number lines (0-1000)**: From Week 2 onwards. Washing line across the classroom with pegged number cards — the children can physically place and move numbers.
- **Counting objects**: Week 1, Week 5. Multilink cubes, counters, real coins for 50p counting.
- **Digit cards**: Weeks 4-6 for ordering activities and games.

### Vocabulary focus

The graph gives me specific vocabulary for each concept. I'll build a working wall with vocabulary grouped by week:

- **Week 1**: multiple, skip count, count in fours/fifties, sequence, pattern
- **Week 2**: hundreds, tens, ones, place value, digit, three-digit number, partition, value, represent, hundred, multiple of 100, number line
- **Week 3**: partition, split, standard, flexible, compose, decompose, ten more, ten less, hundred more, hundred less, increase, decrease, boundary
- **Week 4**: greater than, less than, equal to, compare, order, ascending, descending, >, <, =, numeral, word form
- **Week 5**: doubling, eight times table, estimate, approximately, about, roughly, reasonable, benchmark, halfway
- **Week 6**: All of the above in problem-solving contexts

The word "partition" appears in C007 and C008 vocabulary — I'll introduce it in Week 2 and reinforce in Week 3.

### Differentiation notes

**Lower attainers** (roughly 8 children, including 2 with EHCPs): Will need extended concrete phase. May still be working with two-digit place value in Week 2 before moving to three digits. Pre-teaching group on Monday mornings with the TA. The graph's external prerequisite from MA-Y2-C005 (adding/subtracting two-digit numbers) is the likely weak point — if they can't manipulate two-digit numbers, three-digit place value won't land.

**Middle attainers** (roughly 15 children): Follow the main plan. CPA progression as described. These children should be secure by the mid-unit assessment.

**Higher attainers** (roughly 7 children): Will move to abstract more quickly. Extension tasks: four-digit place value (preview Y4), flexible partitioning challenges, estimation with less scaffolding. During counting in 8s, challenge them to find patterns in the digits (8, 16, 24, 32, 40... the ones digits cycle 8, 6, 4, 2, 0, 8, 6, 4, 2, 0).

### Key misconceptions to watch for (from graph data)

The graph's `common_misconceptions` data is genuinely useful. My top five to watch:

1. **Digit vs value confusion** (C007): "The 3 in 347 is worth 3." This is THE misconception of the unit. I'll hammer this with Dienes: "Show me what the 3 is worth. That's THREE hundred flats, not three cubes."

2. **Zero as placeholder** (C007): 307 being misread as 37, or children writing "three hundred zero seven." I'll plan a specific lesson on this (L8) with numbers like 307, 503, 460.

3. **Boundary cases in 10 more/less** (C005): "10 more than 196 is 1096." This reveals incomplete understanding of carrying. Dienes blocks will show physically that 9 tens + 1 ten = 10 tens = 1 hundred.

4. **Counting in 8s losing place** (C002): The multiples of 8 don't pattern as neatly as 5s or 10s on a hundred square. I'll provide personal number lines and allow finger tracking initially.

5. **Estimation vs guessing** (C010): "I estimated 700 because that's my favourite number." I need to explicitly teach that estimation uses reasoning and benchmarks, not feelings.

## Week-by-Week Planning Narrative

### Week 1: Counting — Building Bridges from Y2

I'm starting with counting because it's familiar and confidence-building. These are the first maths lessons of KS2 for my class. Some children will be anxious, some will be showing off, some will have forgotten everything over summer.

**Lesson 1** is a Y2 recap. Not in the graph — my professional addition. I need to know what they remember. Quick-fire counting in 2s, 5s, 10s. Show me a number on your place value mat. What's this symbol mean? (<, >, =). Informal assessment. Notes in my mark book. This tells me who needs pre-teaching before we hit place value in Week 2.

**Lessons 2-3** cover C001 (counting in 4s, weight 2). Two lessons feels right. Lesson 2 is concrete and pictorial: groups of 4 cubes, number lines, hundred squares with 4s highlighted. The teaching guidance says to connect to the 2 times table — "double 2 is 4, so counting in fours is like counting in twos twice." That's a lovely entry point because they know their 2s from Y2. Lesson 3 is practice: counting from different starting points, counting backwards, "what comes after 28 in the 4s pattern?" The misconception note warns they'll stumble when not starting from zero — I'll deliberately start counts from 12, 24, 36.

**Lessons 4-5** cover C003 (counting in 50s, weight 2). Two lessons. Real 50p coins are my hook — "How many 50p coins make £3?" This connects to money from Y2 and makes it practical. The teaching guidance says to link to the 5 times table scaled by 10 — useful for higher attainers but potentially confusing for lower ones. I'll keep it simple for most: "50, 100, 150... we're adding 50 each time." The misconception about crossing hundreds boundaries (350 → 400) is important — I'll target that in Lesson 5.

I considered putting C004 (counting in 100s) here too, as the algorithm suggests. But C004 has weight 1 — it only needs one lesson — and it connects so naturally to place value that I want it at the start of Week 2 as a bridge. "We've been counting in 4s and 50s. Now let's count in 100s: 100, 200, 300... What do you notice about these numbers?" → leads straight into place value.

### Week 2: Place Value — The Keystone

This is the most important week. C007 has weight 3 and is the keystone. I'm giving it three full lessons (L6-L8), then using C004 (L9) as a breather that reinforces the hundreds column, and introducing C011 (L10) to connect number names to place value.

**Lesson 6** (C007): Pure concrete. Dienes blocks on every table. "This flat is worth one hundred. This stick is worth ten. This cube is worth one. Build me the number 253." Lots of making and reading. Place value mats everywhere. "What's this number? What is the 2 worth? What is the 5 worth?" Insist on "the 2 is worth two hundred" not "the 2 is worth 2."

**Lesson 7** (C007): Arrow cards. Each child has hundreds (100-900), tens (10-90), and ones (1-9) cards. "Slide 300, 40, and 7 together. What number have you made? Now pull them apart. What is 347 made of?" This bridges concrete to pictorial. Also introduce the place value chart as a pictorial tool. Begin to move away from Dienes for higher attainers.

**Lesson 8** (C007): Zero as placeholder. The tricky cases: 307, 460, 500, 101. "Build 307 with Dienes. How many tens sticks? None! So what goes in the tens column?" This is where the digit-vs-value misconception surfaces hard. Also practise: "Is 307 the same as 37? How do we know?" The graph's misconception data flagged this perfectly — zero in the tens place is a Year 3 classic.

**Lesson 9** (C004): Counting in multiples of 100. Weight 1, complexity 1 — this is genuinely the easiest concept in the domain. I'm using it as a breather after three intense place value lessons AND as a bridge. "Count in 100s: 100, 200, 300... 900, 1000! We got to a THOUSAND!" Use Dienes hundred flats: stack them, count them, take them away. Connect to the hundreds digit: "When we count in 100s, which column changes?" Reinforces C007.

**Lesson 10** (C011, first exposure): Reading and writing numbers to 1000 in words. Introduction only — I'm coming back to this in Week 4 for the hard cases. Today: "Three hundred and forty-seven. Let's write that." Teach the "and" convention (British English). Display the reference chart of ones and teens words. Focus on the regular patterns: three hundred, four hundred, five hundred... Most children will manage the hundreds; the compound tens (twenty-one, forty-seven) need the hyphen.

### Week 3: Partitioning and More/Less

Now we apply place value knowledge. C008 (partitioning), C005 (10 more/less), C006 (100 more/less).

**Lesson 11** (C008): Standard partitioning. "347 = 300 + 40 + 7." Arrow cards make this physical. Dienes blocks make it visual. Every child partitions at least 10 numbers. Connect to the spoken form: "three hundred AND forty-seven" — the "and" marks where the hundreds split from the tens and ones. This should flow naturally from Week 2's place value work.

**Lesson 12** (C008): Flexible partitioning. "Can you split 347 a different way? What about 300 + 47? Or 340 + 7? Or 200 + 147?" This is harder. The teaching guidance says to use practical problems: "I have 3 hundreds and 14 tens — what number is that?" I love this because it forces children to think about regrouping. Connection to mental addition strategies: "If I want to add 347 + 26, I could think of 347 as 340 + 7, then 340 + 26 = 366, then 366 + 7 = 373." Higher attainers will fly with this; lower attainers may need to stay with standard partitioning.

**Lesson 13** (C005): Finding 10 more and 10 less — introduction. Dienes blocks: "I have 246. Add a tens stick. What's the new number? 256. Which digit changed?" Practise with straightforward cases first: no boundary crossing. "10 more than 342? 10 less than 567?" Rapid-fire whiteboard work.

**Lesson 14** (C005): Finding 10 more and 10 less — boundary cases. "10 more than 190. Think about it... 200! The tens overflowed into the hundreds!" This is where the misconception data pays off — the graph warned me about 196 + 10 = 1096. Dienes blocks show this physically: 9 tens + 1 ten = 10 tens, which we exchange for 1 hundred. "10 less than 300? 290. The hundreds digit gives one back to the tens." Important transition lesson.

**Lesson 15** (C006): Finding 100 more and 100 less — introduction. "We found 10 more by changing the tens. What if we find 100 more? Which digit changes now?" Dienes blocks: add/remove a hundreds flat. Straightforward cases. "100 more than 324? 424. 100 less than 567? 467. Which digits stayed the same?" The co-teaching signal C005 ↔ C006 works perfectly here: children can directly compare the two skills.

### Week 4: Comparing, Ordering, and the Mid-Assessment

**Lesson 16** (C006): Finding 100 more and 100 less — boundary cases. "100 more than 900? One thousand! We just crossed into four-digit numbers!" The graph's teaching guidance mentions this as "an exciting moment to discuss." Agreed — the children will be buzzing. Also: "100 less than 105? Just 5!" Practise both directions. Some children will change the wrong digit (the graph warns about 334 instead of 424 for 100 more than 324) — have them check with Dienes.

**Lesson 17** (C009): Comparing and ordering numbers to 1000 — introduction. Number line work. "Which is bigger, 456 or 465? How do you know?" Teach the systematic strategy: compare hundreds first, then tens, then ones. Introduce/remind of the > and < symbols. The "hungry crocodile" mnemonic is in the graph guidance — I'll use it briefly but insist they understand WHY 465 > 456 (same hundreds, but 6 tens > 5 tens). Paired work: each pair gets two three-digit numbers and has to explain which is bigger.

**Lesson 18** (C009): Comparing and ordering — ordering sets. Give groups of 4-6 digit cards and ask them to arrange in ascending then descending order. Reasoning is key: "Talk your partner through your strategy." The misconception note says children compare first digits then stop — I'll give sets where multiple numbers share a hundreds digit (324, 387, 319, 352) to force them to look at tens and ones.

**Lesson 19** (C011, second exposure): Reading and writing numbers to 1000 in words — tricky cases. Return to number words for the hard ones: zero placeholder (three hundred and seven — NOT "three hundred zero seven"), compound tens hyphenation (twenty-one, forty-seven), teens irregularity (eleven, twelve, thirteen vs fourteen, fifteen...). Dictation exercise: I say the word, they write the numeral. Then reverse: I show the numeral, they write the word. Cross-check in pairs.

**Lesson 20**: Mid-unit assessment. Written assessment covering C004-C009 and C011. Place value questions (what is the value of the 5 in 253?), partitioning (write 462 as hundreds + tens + ones), 10/100 more and less (including boundary cases), comparing (use < > =), ordering (arrange these numbers smallest to largest), reading/writing in words. This is the keystone check — the graph flagged C007 as the keystone and everything in this assessment depends on it. I'll mark these during lunchtime and adjust Week 5 groupings if needed.

### Week 5: Counting in 8s, Estimation, and Deepening

**Lesson 21** (C002): Counting in multiples of 8 — introduction. The big one. Weight 3, complexity 3. The teaching guidance says to use the doubling connection from 4s, and I agree completely. "Remember counting in 4s? 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24... Now watch: 4 doubled is 8. 8 doubled is 16. 12 doubled is 24. The 8 times table is the 4 times table doubled!" Use a number line with 4s highlighted, then highlight every other one for 8s. Concrete: groups of 8 (spider legs — we're doing mini-beasts in science, perfect cross-curricular link!).

**Lesson 22** (C002): Counting in multiples of 8 — practice. Counting forwards and backwards from different multiples. "Continue from 32: 40, 48, 56..." The graph warns about error-prone transitions at 32→40 and 72→80. I'll focus on these. Choral counting. Pairs testing each other. Start building automatic recall. For lower attainers, number line with 8s marked; for higher attainers, extend to counting in 8s from any number (not just multiples).

**Lesson 23** (C002): Counting in multiples of 8 — fluency and application. Quick-fire questions. "What is the 6th multiple of 8?" "48! How did you work it out?" Application problems: "Spiders have 8 legs. 7 spiders have how many legs?" Connect to multiplication (which they're covering in their calculation unit after half-term). This lesson also serves as a check — can they do it from any starting point, backwards as well as forwards?

**Lesson 24** (C010): Estimating numbers to 1000 — introduction. Weight 3, complexity 3, the hardest concept. Use a large number line (0 to 1000) on the washing line. Mark only 0, 500, and 1000. Point to a position. "What number do you think this is? How did you decide?" Teach estimation as REASONING: "It's about halfway between 500 and 1000, so it's around 750." Not guessing — using benchmarks. The misconception note says children confuse estimation with guessing. I'll explicitly say: "An estimate uses clues. A guess doesn't."

**Lesson 25** (C010): Estimating numbers to 1000 — practical estimation with reasoning. Varied number lines: some marked 0-1000, some 0-500, some 200-400 (zoomed in). Ask children to place numbers AND to identify what number a given position represents. Discuss: "Is 740 a good estimate for this position? Why or why not?" Reasoning and justification are the skills here, not just accuracy. Link to real-world: "About how many children in our school? Is that estimate reasonable?"

### Week 6: Estimation Consolidation, Problem-Solving, and End Assessment

**Lesson 26** (C010): Estimating numbers to 1000 — consolidation. More practice with different representations: jars of objects to estimate, images of grouped items, scales marked in different intervals. The graph's teaching guidance connects estimation to rounding (Y4) — I won't teach rounding explicitly, but I'll say "When you estimated 'about 750', you were saying it's closer to 750 than to 700 or 800. Next year you'll learn to round numbers, and this is exactly the same thinking."

**Lesson 27**: Problem-solving with place value concepts (C007, C008, C009, C011). Multi-step problems: "I think of a three-digit number. The hundreds digit is double the ones digit. The tens digit is 5. The number is greater than 500. What could my number be?" These require children to use place value, partitioning, comparing and number words together. Collaborative: groups of 4, mini-whiteboards, explain your reasoning.

**Lesson 28**: Problem-solving with counting and estimation (C001, C002, C003, C004, C010). Pattern problems: "What is the 12th multiple of 4? How did you work it out?" Estimation challenges: "Without counting, about how many cubes are in this jar? Use what you know about number to explain your estimate." These consolidate the whole domain.

**Lesson 29**: End-of-unit assessment. Covers all 11 concepts. Written assessment plus a practical estimation task (because estimation can't be assessed well on paper alone). I'll include at least one question per concept, with extension questions touching C002 and C010 at higher difficulty levels.

**Lesson 30**: Targeted intervention and extension. Based on Lesson 29 assessment. Intervention groups (TA-led, 4-6 children each) for anyone still insecure on C007 or C008. Extension group works on four-digit place value or Roman numerals (preview of Y4 content). For the main group, maths games reinforcing the whole domain — "Place Value Top Trumps", "Estimation Station", "Race to 1000."

## Final Reflections on the Algorithm vs. My Judgement

The cluster scaffold gave me a useful starting structure. It correctly identified:
- The prerequisite ordering (counting before place value application, 4s before 8s)
- The keystone concept (C007)
- The complexity gradient (simpler concepts first, estimation last)
- The need for an assessment gate after the core place value block

It got wrong (or at least, I disagreed with):
- Placing C006 before the keystone (implicit dependency missed)
- Grouping C011 entirely at the end rather than alongside its co-teaching partner C007
- Duplicating concepts across CL002/CL003 (algorithm artefact)
- Not accounting for transition/recap time (fair — it's a curriculum graph, not a school calendar)

If I were feeding back to the algorithm designers: the co-teaching signals are excellent and should weight more heavily in cluster formation. The prerequisite chain is reliable but misses some "obvious" pedagogical dependencies (you need place value before 100 more/less, even if the graph doesn't have an explicit edge). Consider adding a "soft prerequisite" or "pedagogical dependency" relationship type for these cases.

The teaching_weight values were accurate for my planning — they mapped almost exactly to the number of lessons I'd allocate (weight 1 = 1 lesson, weight 2 = 2 lessons, weight 3 = 3 lessons). Very useful for pacing.

The keystone flag on C007 confirmed my instinct and gave me confidence to allocate a disproportionate amount of time to it. If a concept is the keystone, it should get at least one extra lesson and an assessment gate after it. The algorithm's CL003 assessment cluster captures this intent.

Overall: the scaffold saved me probably 30 minutes of blank-page deliberation and gave me a data-informed starting point. But it needed about an hour of teacher rearrangement to become a plan I'd actually teach. That feels like the right balance — the algorithm does the heavy lifting of sequencing and grouping, the teacher applies contextual knowledge (transition, school calendar, children's needs, cross-curricular links) to polish it.
