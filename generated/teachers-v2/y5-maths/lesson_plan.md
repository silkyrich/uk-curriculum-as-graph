## Week 1: Number Properties — Factors, Primes, Squares & Cubes

*Cluster reference: MA-Y5-D003-CL001 (Introduction)*
*Focus: Building the number theory foundation that underpins all fraction work*

### Lesson 1 — What Are Factors? Systematic Factor Pair Listing

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | MA-Y5-C005 (Factors, common factors and multiples) |
| **Cluster** | MA-Y5-D003-CL001 |
| **Objective** | Find all factor pairs of a number up to 100 using systematic listing; understand that factors divide a number exactly |
| **Key vocabulary** | factor, factor pair, divisible, divide exactly, systematic, product |
| **Misconception focus** | Confusing factors with multiples; missing factor pairs by unsystematic listing |

**Structure**:
- **Concrete** (15 min): Multilink cube rectangle investigation — "How many different rectangles can you make with 24 cubes?" Record each as a factor pair (1×24, 2×12, 3×8, 4×6). Repeat with 36.
- **Pictorial** (15 min): Factor pair T-chart method — model systematic listing from 1 upward, stopping when factors "meet in the middle" (when the next trial number squared exceeds the target).
- **Practice** (20 min): Find all factor pairs for 18, 30, 48, 60, 72, 100. Extension: "Which number under 50 has the most factor pairs?"
- **Plenary** (10 min): "Factors are Few, Multiples are Many" — introduce the mnemonic. Preview: "Next lesson we'll find factors that two numbers SHARE."

---

### Lesson 2 — Common Factors and Highest Common Factor (HCF)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | MA-Y5-C005 |
| **Cluster** | MA-Y5-D003-CL001 |
| **Objective** | Identify common factors of two numbers and find the highest common factor (HCF) using Venn diagrams |
| **Key vocabulary** | common factor, highest common factor (HCF), Venn diagram, shared, overlap |
| **Misconception focus** | Stopping after finding one common factor; confusing HCF with product of factors |

**Structure**:
- **Recall** (5 min): Quick factor listing warm-up — list all factors of 20, then all factors of 30.
- **Model** (15 min): Venn diagram — factors of 20 in left circle, factors of 30 in right circle, common factors in the overlap {1, 2, 5, 10}. HCF = 10, the largest in the overlap. Repeat with 24 and 36.
- **Guided practice** (15 min): Pairs find common factors and HCF for: (12, 18), (16, 24), (15, 25), (30, 45).
- **Connect forward** (10 min): "When we simplify fractions like 24/36, we'll divide both numbers by their HCF. The HCF of 24 and 36 is 12, so 24/36 = 2/3. Factors will help us with fractions."
- **Independent practice** (15 min): Worksheet — find HCF of given pairs; use HCF to simplify fractions (preview).

---

### Lesson 3 — Multiples and Lowest Common Multiple (LCM)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | MA-Y5-C005 |
| **Cluster** | MA-Y5-D003-CL001 |
| **Objective** | List multiples of a number; find common multiples of two numbers; identify the LCM |
| **Key vocabulary** | multiple, common multiple, lowest common multiple (LCM), sequence, infinite, skip counting |
| **Misconception focus** | Confusing factors and multiples; thinking multiples are finite; confusing LCM with HCF |

**Structure**:
- **Concrete** (10 min): Skip counting on parallel number lines — multiples of 4 in blue, multiples of 6 in red. "Where do they land on the same number?" → 12, 24, 36... LCM = 12 (the first meeting point).
- **Model** (15 min): Systematic method — list first 10 multiples of each number, circle common multiples, identify LCM. Work through (3, 5) → LCM = 15; (4, 6) → LCM = 12; (6, 8) → LCM = 24.
- **Connect forward** (10 min): "When we add 1/4 + 1/6, we need a common denominator. The LCM of 4 and 6 is 12. So we convert both fractions to twelfths. This is EXACTLY why we need LCM." Show fraction bars briefly to preview.
- **Practice** (15 min): Find LCM of: (3, 4), (5, 6), (4, 10), (6, 9), (8, 12). Extension: find LCM of three numbers.
- **Plenary** (10 min): "Factors shrink numbers (HCF simplifies fractions). Multiples grow numbers (LCM finds common denominators). We need both."

### Lesson 4 — Prime Numbers and the Sieve of Eratosthenes

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | MA-Y5-C003 (Prime numbers and composite numbers) |
| **Cluster** | MA-Y5-D003-CL001 |
| **Objective** | Identify prime and composite numbers up to 100; recall prime numbers up to 19; understand why 1 is not prime |
| **Key vocabulary** | prime number, composite number, Sieve of Eratosthenes, factor, divisible, 1 is neither prime nor composite |
| **Misconception focus** | Including 1 as prime; thinking all odd numbers are prime; forgetting 2 is prime (and the only even prime) |

**Structure**:
- **Hook** (5 min): "A prime number has EXACTLY two different factors: 1 and itself. What number is tricky?" → Discussion about 1 (only one factor — not prime) and 2 (the only even prime).
- **Investigation** (20 min): Sieve of Eratosthenes — each child has a 1–100 grid. Step by step: cross out 1 (not prime), circle 2 then cross out all other multiples of 2, circle 3 then cross out all other multiples of 3, circle 5 then cross out remaining multiples of 5, circle 7 then cross out remaining multiples of 7. The survivors are prime. Observe the pattern.
- **Discussion** (10 min): "The Trial of the Number 1" — put 1 on trial. Defence: "I'm special, I should be prime!" Prosecution: "You only have ONE factor. Primes need TWO." Verdict: not prime, not composite. A category of one.
- **Sorting** (10 min): Odd numbers 1–50 — sort into "prime" and "not prime." Counter-example for "all odd numbers are prime": 9 = 3×3, 15 = 3×5, 21 = 3×7, 25 = 5×5, 27 = 3×9...
- **Rapid recall** (10 min): "The prime numbers up to 19 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19." Chant, write, test. Flash card pairs practice.
- **Plenary** (5 min): Connect to factors — "A prime number has only one factor pair: 1 × itself. A composite number has more than one factor pair."

### Lesson 5 — Square Numbers, Cube Numbers & Week 1 Review

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | MA-Y5-C004 (Square numbers and cube numbers), plus C003 and C005 review |
| **Cluster** | MA-Y5-D003-CL001 |
| **Objective** | Identify square numbers to 144 and cube numbers to 125; use n² and n³ notation; connect to area and volume |
| **Key vocabulary** | square number, cube number, squared, cubed, n², n³, array, power, notation |
| **Misconception focus** | Thinking n² means n×2 (e.g. 5²=10); thinking n³ means n×3; not connecting to physical arrays |

**Structure**:
- **Concrete** (15 min): Physical square arrays — build 3×3 (=9), 4×4 (=16), 5×5 (=25) with Multilink cubes. Count the total. "This is why we call them SQUARE numbers — they make a square." Build 2×2×2 (=8) and 3×3×3 (=27) cubic structures. "CUBE numbers make a cube."
- **Notation** (10 min): Introduce n² and n³ notation AFTER the physical experience. "5² means 5×5 = 25, NOT 5×2 = 10. The small 2 means 'multiplied by itself' not 'multiplied by 2.'" Use the arrays as proof.
- **Connect** (10 min): Square numbers and area: a square with side 4 cm has area 4² = 16 cm². Cube numbers and volume: a cube with side 3 cm has volume 3³ = 27 cm³. Connect to factors: "Square numbers have an ODD number of factors. Why?" Because one factor pair is the number with itself (4×4 for 16), counted only once.
- **List building** (5 min): Generate square numbers to 12² = 144 and cubes to 5³ = 125. Display on working wall.
- **Week 1 Review Quiz** (20 min): Quick-fire 10-question quiz covering all of Week 1 — factor pairs, HCF, LCM, primes, composites, squares, cubes. Self-mark and identify areas for improvement.

## Week 2: Formal Written Methods — Long Multiplication & Short Division

*Cluster reference: MA-Y5-D003-CL002 (Practice) and MA-Y5-D003-CL003 (Assessment)*
*Focus: Securing the formal written methods; bridging division remainders to fractions*

---

### Lesson 6 — Long Multiplication: From Grid Method to Formal Layout

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | MA-Y5-C006 (Long multiplication, 4-digit × 2-digit) |
| **Cluster** | MA-Y5-D003-CL002 |
| **Objective** | Understand long multiplication as a compressed form of the grid method; compute 2-digit × 2-digit and 3-digit × 2-digit products |
| **Key vocabulary** | long multiplication, grid method, partial product, formal method, compress, placeholder |
| **Misconception focus** | Forgetting the placeholder zero in the second partial product; not understanding why the method works |

**Structure**:
- **Connect** (10 min): Grid method review — 47 × 23. Grid: (40×20=800, 40×3=120, 7×20=140, 7×3=21). Total = 1081.
- **Bridge** (15 min): Show long multiplication side by side with the grid. First row: 47 × 3 = 141 (ones partial product). Second row: 47 × 20 = 940 (tens partial product — placeholder 0 then multiply by 2). Add: 141 + 940 = 1081. "Same answer, different layout."
- **Key teaching point** (5 min): The placeholder zero — WHY it's there. "We're multiplying by 20 (2 tens), not 2. The zero holds the ones place because the result is in tens."
- **Estimation** (5 min): Before multiplying, estimate: 47 × 23 ≈ 50 × 20 = 1000. Answer should be near 1000. 1081 ✓.
- **Guided practice** (15 min): Together: 63 × 45, 128 × 34, 256 × 17. Check each against estimate.
- **Independent practice** (10 min): 5 calculations with increasing difficulty, self-checking with estimation.

---

### Lesson 7 — Long Multiplication: 4-Digit × 2-Digit Fluency

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | MA-Y5-C006 |
| **Cluster** | MA-Y5-D003-CL002 |
| **Objective** | Accurately multiply 4-digit numbers by 2-digit numbers using formal long multiplication |
| **Key vocabulary** | long multiplication, carry, partial product, place value, estimate, column addition |
| **Misconception focus** | Errors with carrying across columns; forgetting to add carries from first row before starting second |

**Structure**:
- **Warm-up** (5 min): Mental multiplication — 30 × 40, 200 × 50, 3000 × 20 (building place value fluency).
- **Model** (15 min): 2,347 × 56. Estimate first: 2,000 × 60 = 120,000. Work through carefully, narrating carries. First row: 2347 × 6 = 14,082. Second row: 2347 × 50 = 117,350. Total: 131,432. Compare to estimate — reasonable.
- **Common error analysis** (10 min): Show a WRONG worked example with the placeholder zero missing. "What went wrong? How does this change the answer?" Children diagnose the error.
- **Paired fluency** (20 min): Partner A calculates, Partner B estimates and checks. Swap. 6 calculations: 1,245 × 34; 3,067 × 28; 4,500 × 43; 1,983 × 67; 2,106 × 55; 3,724 × 19.
- **Word problems** (10 min): "A school orders 1,250 exercise books at 47p each. What is the total cost?" (Multiply then convert pence to pounds.)

### Lesson 8 — Short Division: Consolidating the Bus Stop Method

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | MA-Y5-C007 (Short division with remainders) |
| **Cluster** | MA-Y5-D003-CL002 |
| **Objective** | Divide numbers up to 4 digits by a 1-digit number using formal short division |
| **Key vocabulary** | short division, bus stop method, dividend, divisor, quotient, remainder, carry, exchange |
| **Misconception focus** | Forgetting to write zero in quotient when a digit divides to zero; not carrying remainders correctly |

**Structure**:
- **Review** (10 min): 2-digit ÷ 1-digit to warm up the method. 84 ÷ 7, 96 ÷ 4, 75 ÷ 3. Quick and confident.
- **Extend to 3-digit** (10 min): 432 ÷ 6 = 72; 567 ÷ 9 = 63. Model bus stop layout with carry notation.
- **Extend to 4-digit** (15 min): 3,648 ÷ 4 = 912; 5,439 ÷ 7 = 777; 3,024 ÷ 4 = 756. Emphasise the ZERO: "3,024 ÷ 4: 3÷4 won't go, carry 3 to make 30. 30÷4=7 r2, carry 2 to make 22. 22÷4=5 r2, carry 2 to make 24. 24÷4=6." Wait — let me recheck. Actually: 3024 ÷ 4: 3÷4=0 r3 (write 0, carry 3), 30÷4=7 r2 (carry 2), 22÷4=5 r2 (carry 2), 24÷4=6. Answer = 0756 = 756. Key: writing that leading zero or starting with "thirty hundreds."
- **Fluency practice** (15 min): 8 calculations with increasing difficulty. Include at least 2 with zero in the quotient.
- **Plenary** (10 min): Use multiplication to check: "756 × 4 = ?" Verify using long multiplication from yesterday. Inverse operations in action.

---

### Lesson 9 — Short Division: Interpreting Remainders in Context

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | MA-Y5-C007, with bridge to MA-Y5-C009 |
| **Cluster** | MA-Y5-D003-CL002 |
| **Objective** | Interpret division remainders appropriately — as whole number remainder, fraction, decimal, or by rounding up/down |
| **Key vocabulary** | remainder, interpret, context, round up, round down, fraction, decimal |
| **Misconception focus** | Always giving remainder as whole number regardless of context; not recognising when to round up |

**Structure**:
- **Three problems, one calculation** (20 min): 43 ÷ 5 = 8 remainder 3.
  - Context 1 — Groups: "43 children, minibuses of 5. How many buses?" → 9 (round UP — can't leave children behind)
  - Context 2 — Money: "Share £43 equally among 5 people." → £8.60 (remainder as decimal: 3/5 = 0.6)
  - Context 3 — Objects: "43 stickers, 5 per page. How many full pages?" → 8 (round DOWN — can't have a partial page)
  - Context 4 — Fractions: "Share 43 biscuits among 5 people." → 8 3/5 each (remainder as fraction)
- **Key bridge moment** (10 min): "The remainder 3 in '43 ÷ 5 = 8 r3' IS a fraction: 3/5. And 3/5 as a decimal is 0.6. So 43 ÷ 5 = 8.6 = 8 3/5." This connects D003 division to D004 fractions and decimals. "Division and fractions are the SAME THING: a/b means a ÷ b."
- **Sorting activity** (15 min): 10 word problems — children calculate AND decide how to express the remainder. Sort into: round up / round down / give as fraction / give as decimal.
- **Independent practice** (10 min): 6 contextual division problems requiring remainder interpretation.
- **Plenary** (5 min): "The remainder isn't always a whole number leftover. It can become a fraction, a decimal, or tell you to round. The CONTEXT decides."

### Lesson 10 — Number Properties & Methods: Assessment

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | MA-Y5-C003, C004, C005, C006, C007 (all D003 concepts) |
| **Cluster** | MA-Y5-D003-CL003 (Assessment) |
| **Objective** | Demonstrate understanding of number properties (factors, primes, squares/cubes) and formal written methods (long multiplication, short division) |
| **Key vocabulary** | All D003 vocabulary |

**Structure**:
- **Written assessment** (35 min): 15 questions across all D003 concepts:
  - Q1–3: Factor pairs, common factors, HCF
  - Q4–5: Multiples, LCM
  - Q6–7: Prime and composite number identification
  - Q8–9: Square and cube numbers with notation
  - Q10–11: Long multiplication (3-digit × 2-digit, 4-digit × 2-digit)
  - Q12–13: Short division (4-digit ÷ 1-digit, with and without remainder)
  - Q14–15: Contextual problems requiring remainder interpretation
- **Self-assessment** (10 min): Traffic light each concept area — green (confident), amber (mostly secure), red (need help). Record in maths journal.
- **Review** (15 min): Go through 3 commonly-missed questions together. Identify intervention groups for morning maths sessions. Children who scored below threshold on factors/LCM join intervention — they need this before fractions.

## Week 3: Fractions — Building Understanding

*Cluster reference: MA-Y5-D004-CL001 (Introduction)*
*Focus: Equivalent fractions, mixed numbers, and beginning fraction addition/subtraction*

---

### Lesson 11 — Equivalent Fractions: The Key to Everything

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | MA-Y5-C008 (prerequisite review: equivalent fractions from Y4-C011) |
| **Cluster** | MA-Y5-D004-CL001 |
| **Objective** | Generate families of equivalent fractions; simplify fractions using HCF; recognise equivalence between tenths and hundredths |
| **Key vocabulary** | equivalent fraction, simplify, numerator, denominator, multiply, divide, HCF |

**Structure**:
- **Concrete** (15 min): Fraction wall — physically comparing strips. "Find as many fractions equal to 1/2 as you can" → 2/4, 3/6, 4/8, 5/10, 6/12. "Find fractions equal to 1/3" → 2/6, 3/9, 4/12. What's the pattern? Multiply (or divide) numerator and denominator by the same number.
- **Connect to factors** (10 min): Simplifying using HCF. "Simplify 8/12." HCF of 8 and 12 = 4. Divide both by 4: 2/3. "Simplify 15/25." HCF of 15 and 25 = 5. Answer: 3/5. "This is WHY we learned HCF!"
- **Tenths and hundredths** (10 min): 3/10 = 30/100 (×10). 7/10 = 70/100 (×10). This previews the decimal-fraction link.
- **Directed practice** (15 min): Generate equivalent fractions for given fractions; simplify given fractions; fill in missing numerators/denominators.
- **Challenge** (10 min): "Write 3/5 with denominator 20." → 12/20. "Write 7/8 with denominator 40." → 35/40. "How did you decide what to multiply by?" Because you need denominator knowledge — a preview of finding common denominators.

---

### Lesson 12 — Mixed Numbers & Improper Fractions: Introduction

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | MA-Y5-C009 (Mixed numbers and improper fractions) |
| **Cluster** | MA-Y5-D004-CL001 |
| **Objective** | Understand that improper fractions have numerator ≥ denominator; identify and represent mixed numbers; see that both forms show the same value |
| **Key vocabulary** | mixed number, improper fraction, whole, part, numerator, denominator, number line |
| **Misconception focus** | Believing improper fractions are "wrong"; not recognising they represent values greater than 1 |

**Structure**:
- **Concrete** (15 min): Fraction circles (quarters). "Show me 7/4." Children assemble: one whole circle (4/4) + three more quarters (3/4). "7/4 is the SAME as 1 and 3/4." Both representations sit side by side.
- **Number line** (15 min): Draw a number line from 0 to 3, marked in quarters: 0, 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4(=1), 5/4, 6/4, 7/4, 8/4(=2)... Children place given improper fractions AND their mixed number equivalents on the same line. Key insight: fractions don't stop at 1.
- **Identification practice** (10 min): Sort cards into "proper fraction", "improper fraction", "mixed number". Children explain their reasoning for each.
- **Discussion** (10 min): "Are improper fractions wrong?" No — they're perfectly valid. Sometimes they're easier to work with (especially when multiplying). Both forms have their place.
- **Exit ticket** (10 min): "Write 11/3 as a mixed number. Write 2 5/8 as an improper fraction." (Don't teach the method yet — see who can reason it out from the visual work.)

---

### Lesson 13 — Converting Between Mixed Numbers and Improper Fractions

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | MA-Y5-C009 |
| **Cluster** | MA-Y5-D004-CL001 |
| **Objective** | Convert fluently between improper fractions and mixed numbers using division and multiplication methods |
| **Key vocabulary** | convert, divide, quotient, remainder, multiply, add, numerator, denominator |
| **Misconception focus** | Forgetting to add the numerator when converting mixed → improper (writing 2 3/5 as 10/5 not 13/5) |

**Structure**:
- **Method 1 — Improper to mixed** (15 min): Divide numerator by denominator. 17/5: 17 ÷ 5 = 3 remainder 2 → 3 2/5. Verify on number line: 17/5 is between 3 and 4. ✓ Practise 5 examples.
- **Method 2 — Mixed to improper** (15 min): Multiply whole number by denominator, ADD numerator. 3 2/5: (3 × 5) + 2 = 17 → 17/5. "MULTIPLY and ADD" — emphasise the "and add." Common error: 3 × 5 = 15, STOP → 15/5 = 3 (that's just the whole number part!). The "+2" is the fraction part. Verify: 17/5 = 3 2/5. ✓
- **Estimation check** (5 min): "If your mixed number is between 3 and 4, your improper fraction must be between 15/5 and 20/5. Is 17/5 between 15/5 and 20/5? Yes. ✓"
- **Fluency pairs** (15 min): Partner drill — 20 conversions in both directions, timed. Mark together, discuss errors.
- **Problem context** (10 min): "A recipe uses 2 1/4 cups of flour. You want to make 3 batches. How much flour?" Convert, multiply, convert back. (Preview of multiplying fractions by whole numbers.)

### Lesson 14 — Adding Fractions: Same Denominator, Then Related Denominators

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | MA-Y5-C008 (Adding and subtracting fractions with different denominators) |
| **Cluster** | MA-Y5-D004-CL001 |
| **Objective** | Add fractions with the same denominator; add fractions where one denominator is a multiple of the other |
| **Key vocabulary** | add, numerator, denominator, common denominator, equivalent fraction, convert |
| **Misconception focus** | Adding denominators as well as numerators (e.g. 2/5 + 1/5 = 3/10) |

**Structure**:
- **Same denominator** (15 min): 2/7 + 3/7 = 5/7. Fraction bar model: two-sevenths shaded, then three more. Total = five-sevenths. "WHY do we add only the numerators?" Because the denominator tells us the SIZE of the pieces — same-size pieces, just count them. Model 5 examples with fraction bars.
- **Key question** (5 min): "What about 1/4 + 3/8? The pieces are DIFFERENT sizes. Can we add them directly?" No. "We need to make them the same size."
- **Related denominators** (20 min): When one denominator is a multiple of the other, only ONE fraction needs converting. 1/4 + 3/8: 8 is a multiple of 4, so convert 1/4 = 2/8. Now: 2/8 + 3/8 = 5/8. Fraction bars confirm. More examples: 1/3 + 5/6, 2/5 + 7/10, 1/2 + 3/8.
- **Guided practice** (10 min): 6 additions — mixture of same-denominator and related-denominator. Children identify which type each is before calculating.
- **Plenary** (10 min): "What if NEITHER denominator is a multiple of the other? Like 1/3 + 1/4? We'll tackle that on Monday — and you'll need your LCM skills from Week 1!"

---

### Lesson 15 — Subtracting Fractions: Same Denominator, Then Related Denominators

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | MA-Y5-C008 |
| **Cluster** | MA-Y5-D004-CL001 |
| **Objective** | Subtract fractions with the same denominator and with related denominators; simplify answers using HCF |
| **Key vocabulary** | subtract, difference, common denominator, simplify, HCF, equivalent |
| **Misconception focus** | Subtracting denominators; not simplifying the answer |

**Structure**:
- **Same denominator** (10 min): 5/8 - 3/8 = 2/8 = 1/4. Fraction bar: shade 5 eighths, cross out 3. Simplify: HCF of 2 and 8 = 2, so 2/8 = 1/4. "Always check if you can simplify — use your HCF skills!"
- **Related denominators** (15 min): 3/4 - 1/8. Convert: 3/4 = 6/8. Now: 6/8 - 1/8 = 5/8. More examples: 7/10 - 2/5, 5/6 - 1/3, 3/4 - 1/2.
- **Mixed practice** (15 min): Addition AND subtraction with same/related denominators. Children choose the operation from a word problem: "Ava ate 3/8 of a pizza. Ben ate 1/4. How much did they eat altogether? How much more did Ava eat than Ben?"
- **Challenge** (10 min): "I think of a fraction. I subtract 1/6 and get 1/2. What was my fraction?" → x - 1/6 = 1/2 → x = 1/2 + 1/6 = 3/6 + 1/6 = 4/6 = 2/3. Working backwards.
- **Plenary** (10 min): Review the two types seen so far (same denominator, related denominator). Preview Monday: the "truly different denominators" challenge.

## Week 4: Fractions — Depth and Fluency

*Cluster reference: MA-Y5-D004-CL001 (Introduction, continued)*
*Focus: LCM-based common denominators, fractions > 1, multiplying fractions, problem-solving*

### Lesson 16 — Adding & Subtracting Fractions with Truly Different Denominators

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | MA-Y5-C008 |
| **Cluster** | MA-Y5-D004-CL001 |
| **Objective** | Add and subtract fractions using LCM to find the common denominator when neither denominator is a multiple of the other |
| **Key vocabulary** | lowest common multiple, LCM, common denominator, convert, equivalent fraction |
| **Misconception focus** | Adding numerators AND denominators (1/3 + 1/4 = 2/7) — THE classic error |

**Structure**:
- **Provoke the misconception** (10 min): "Quick — what's 1/3 + 1/4?" Some will say 2/7. Don't correct yet. Hold up fraction bars for 1/3 and 1/4 side by side — together they're clearly MORE than 1/2. Hold up 2/7 — it's clearly LESS than 1/2. "Is 2/7 right?" Visual disproof.
- **The correct method** (20 min): Step by step:
  1. Find LCM of denominators: LCM(3, 4) = 12
  2. Convert both: 1/3 = 4/12, 1/4 = 3/12
  3. Add: 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12
  4. Simplify if possible (7/12 is already simplified)
  Verify with fraction bars: 7/12 is just over half the bar. ✓
- **More examples** (15 min): Work through together: 2/3 + 1/5 (LCM=15), 3/4 - 1/3 (LCM=12), 1/6 + 2/5 (LCM=30), 5/6 - 3/8 (LCM=24). Fraction bar verification for each.
- **Guided to independent** (15 min): 6 calculations with reducing scaffolding — first two have LCM given, next two have step-by-step frame, last two are independent.

### Lesson 17 — Fractions Greater Than 1: Linking Operations to Mixed Numbers

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | MA-Y5-C008, MA-Y5-C009 |
| **Cluster** | MA-Y5-D004-CL001 |
| **Objective** | Add fractions where the result exceeds 1; convert improper fraction results to mixed numbers and simplify |
| **Key vocabulary** | improper fraction, mixed number, convert, simplify, greater than 1 |

**Structure**:
- **Model** (15 min): 4/5 + 3/5 = 7/5. "7/5 is more than 1 whole. Convert to mixed number: 7 ÷ 5 = 1 remainder 2 → 1 2/5." Number line verification.
- **With different denominators** (15 min): 2/3 + 5/6. LCM = 6. 2/3 = 4/6. 4/6 + 5/6 = 9/6 = 1 3/6 = 1 1/2. Three steps: convert to common denominator → add → convert to mixed number → simplify.
- **Subtraction from a whole/mixed number** (10 min): "2 - 3/4." Think: 2 = 8/4. So 8/4 - 3/4 = 5/4 = 1 1/4. Or: 2 = 1 4/4, so 1 4/4 - 3/4 = 1 1/4.
- **Practice** (15 min): Mixed addition and subtraction where answers may or may not exceed 1. Children must decide whether to convert to a mixed number.
- **Plenary** (5 min): "When you add fractions and get an improper fraction, ALWAYS convert to a mixed number for your final answer — unless the question says otherwise."

### Lesson 18 — Multiplying Fractions and Mixed Numbers by Whole Numbers

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | MA-Y5-C008 (multiplication extension) |
| **Cluster** | MA-Y5-D004-CL001 |
| **Objective** | Multiply proper fractions and mixed numbers by whole numbers, supported by diagrams |
| **Key vocabulary** | multiply, of, repeated addition, whole number, convert, improper fraction |

**Structure**:
- **Repeated addition model** (10 min): "What is 3 × 2/5?" = 2/5 + 2/5 + 2/5 = 6/5 = 1 1/5. Draw 3 bars, each with 2/5 shaded. Count total shaded fifths.
- **The shortcut** (10 min): Multiply the numerator by the whole number, keep the denominator: 3 × 2/5 = (3×2)/5 = 6/5 = 1 1/5. "Why does this work?" Because we're adding the same fraction 3 times, so we're adding the numerator 3 times.
- **Mixed numbers** (15 min): 2 × 1 3/4. Two approaches:
  - Convert first: 1 3/4 = 7/4 → 2 × 7/4 = 14/4 = 3 2/4 = 3 1/2
  - Distribute: 2 × 1 = 2, 2 × 3/4 = 6/4 = 1 1/2. Total = 2 + 1 1/2 = 3 1/2
  Show both, let children choose. Verify with bar model.
- **Practice** (15 min): Proper fractions × whole numbers (6 Qs), mixed numbers × whole numbers (4 Qs).
- **Word problems** (10 min): "Each sandwich uses 3/4 of a bread roll. How many rolls for 6 sandwiches?" 6 × 3/4 = 18/4 = 4 2/4 = 4 1/2 rolls. Need to buy 5.

| **Objective** | Solve multi-step problems involving addition, subtraction and multiplication of fractions |
| **Key vocabulary** | multi-step, strategy, bar model, operation, check, efficient |

**Structure**:
- **Bar model strategy** (10 min): Model how to represent a fraction problem with a bar model BEFORE calculating. "A recipe uses 2/3 cup flour and 1/4 cup sugar. How much more flour than sugar?" Draw the bar, shade both amounts, identify the difference. Then calculate: 2/3 - 1/4 = 8/12 - 3/12 = 5/12.
- **Problem set 1 — Guided** (15 min): Work through 3 multi-step problems together:
  - "Priya reads 3/8 on Monday and 1/4 on Tuesday. What fraction is left?" (3/8 + 2/8 = 5/8 read; 1 - 5/8 = 3/8 left)
  - "A 3/4 m ribbon is cut into 3 equal pieces. How long is each piece?" (3/4 ÷ 3 = 1/4 m — using fraction ÷ whole number as inverse of multiplication)
  - "Jake has 2 1/2 kg of flour. He uses 3/4 kg for bread and 2/3 kg for cake. How much is left?" (2 1/2 - 3/4 - 2/3 = 30/12 - 9/12 - 8/12 = 13/12 = 1 1/12 kg)
- **Problem set 2 — Independent** (25 min): 5 multi-step problems, ranging in difficulty. Children work independently, using bar models to plan before calculating. Extension problems available for fast finishers.
- **Gallery walk** (10 min): Children display their bar models. Class circulates, leaving positive feedback and questions on sticky notes.

## Week 5: Decimals — Thousandths and the Fraction-Decimal Bridge

*Cluster reference: MA-Y5-D004-CL001 (continued, bridging to CL002)*
*Focus: Extending decimal place value; connecting fractions and decimals*

---

### Lesson 21 — Thousandths: Extending the Place Value Chart

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | MA-Y5-C013 (Thousandths and decimal place value to 3 decimal places) |
| **Cluster** | MA-Y5-D004-CL001 |
| **Objective** | Understand thousandths as 1/1000 = 0.001; read and write numbers with up to 3 decimal places; identify the value of each digit |
| **Key vocabulary** | thousandth, 0.001, 1/1000, three decimal places, place value, tenths, hundredths, decimal point |
| **Misconception focus** | Confusing thousandths with thousands; thinking 0.003 is bigger than 0.3 because "there are more digits" |

**Structure**:
- **Place value chart** (15 min): Extend the class place value chart to include thousandths. "Each column is ÷10 as we move right: ones → tenths → hundredths → thousandths." Show: 1 whole = 10 tenths = 100 hundredths = 1000 thousandths.
- **Measurement context** (10 min): Metre sticks. 1 m = 1.000 m. 1 cm = 0.01 m. 1 mm = 0.001 m. "Measure your pencil to the nearest mm. Write it as a decimal of a metre." A pencil that's 17.4 cm long = 0.174 m.
- **Reading and writing** (10 min): "Write these as decimals: 3 thousandths (0.003), 45 thousandths (0.045), 237 thousandths (0.237), 6 and 4 thousandths (6.004)."
- **Digit value** (10 min): "In 3.456, what is the value of the 5?" 5 hundredths = 0.05. "What is the value of the 6?" 6 thousandths = 0.006.
- **Division connection** (5 min): 3 ÷ 1000 = 0.003. 47 ÷ 1000 = 0.047. Pattern: dividing by 1000 = moving the decimal point 3 places left.
- **Practice** (10 min): Place value worksheets — reading, writing, identifying digit values to 3 dp.

---

### Lesson 22 — Ordering and Comparing Decimals to 3 Decimal Places

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | MA-Y5-C013 |
| **Cluster** | MA-Y5-D004-CL001 |
| **Objective** | Order and compare numbers with up to 3 decimal places; explain reasoning using place value |
| **Key vocabulary** | compare, order, greater than, less than, equal to, ascending, descending, place value |
| **Misconception focus** | Thinking "longer" decimals are larger (0.35 > 0.4 because 35 > 4) |

**Structure**:
- **Column comparison** (15 min): Write numbers with decimal points aligned. Compare digit by digit from left:
  - 0.4 vs 0.35: tenths column: 4 vs 3 → 0.4 > 0.35 ✓
  - 0.72 vs 0.702: tenths same (7), hundredths: 2 vs 0 → 0.72 > 0.702
  - 3.456 vs 3.465: ones same, tenths same, hundredths: 5 vs 6 → 3.456 < 3.465
- **Address misconception directly** (10 min): "Some people think 0.35 > 0.4 because 35 > 4. But watch: 0.4 = 0.400 and 0.35 = 0.350. Now compare: 400 thousandths vs 350 thousandths. 0.4 is bigger." Column alignment is the key.
- **Number line placement** (10 min): Place decimals on a number line from 0 to 1 marked in tenths. Where does 0.35 go? Between 0.3 and 0.4, closer to 0.4. Where does 0.305? Between 0.3 and 0.31, very close to 0.3.
- **Sorting activity** (15 min): Sets of 6 decimal cards — order from smallest to largest. Pairs work together, explaining reasoning. Sets include "trap" pairs like (0.4, 0.39) and (0.5, 0.500).
- **Plenary** (10 min): "The number of decimal places tells you NOTHING about the size of the number. 0.4 is bigger than 0.399. Always compare place by place."

---

### Lesson 23 — Rounding Decimals

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | MA-Y5-C013 |
| **Cluster** | MA-Y5-D004-CL001 |
| **Objective** | Round decimals with 2 decimal places to the nearest whole number and to 1 decimal place |
| **Key vocabulary** | round, nearest, approximately, decimal place, round up, round down |

**Structure**:
- **Number line model** (15 min): Rounding 3.74 to the nearest whole number. Draw number line from 3 to 4. Where is 3.74? Very close to 4 but on the 3 side of 3.75 → rounds to 4? No — 3.74 is closer to 4 than to 3? Let's check: distance to 3 = 0.74, distance to 4 = 0.26. Closer to 4. Rounds to 4. The "look at the next digit" rule: tenths digit is 7 (≥5) → round up.
- **Rounding to 1 dp** (15 min): 3.74 to 1 dp. Sits between 3.7 and 3.8. Hundredths digit is 4 (<5) → rounds to 3.7. More examples: 6.85 → 6.9, 2.349 → 2.3, 0.951 → 1.0.
- **The "0.95 rounds to 1.0" moment** (5 min): "When you round 0.95 to 1 dp, you get 1.0, not 0.10. The decimal point doesn't move — the value crosses a whole number boundary."
- **Estimation application** (10 min): "Estimate 3.78 + 2.14" → roughly 4 + 2 = 6. Calculate: 5.92. Close to estimate ✓. Rounding helps us check whether answers are reasonable.
- **Practice** (15 min): Mixed rounding exercises — round to nearest whole, round to 1 dp, round to 2 dp. Include estimation-then-calculate problems.

### Lesson 24 — Decimals as Fractions: Building the Bridge

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | MA-Y5-C013, MA-Y5-C010 (beginning) |
| **Cluster** | MA-Y5-D004-CL001 |
| **Objective** | Read and write decimal numbers as fractions (e.g. 0.71 = 71/100); simplify where possible; begin the fraction-decimal connection |
| **Key vocabulary** | tenths, hundredths, thousandths, fraction, decimal, equivalent, simplify |

**Structure**:
- **Place value chart as bridge** (10 min): "0.7 = 7 tenths = 7/10. 0.71 = 71 hundredths = 71/100. 0.714 = 714 thousandths = 714/1000." The denominator tells you the place value.
- **Conversion practice** (10 min): Decimal → fraction: 0.3 = 3/10, 0.25 = 25/100, 0.125 = 125/1000. Fraction → decimal: 3/10 = 0.3, 7/100 = 0.07, 23/1000 = 0.023.
- **Simplifying** (10 min): 0.5 = 5/10 = 1/2 (÷5). 0.25 = 25/100 = 1/4 (÷25). 0.75 = 75/100 = 3/4 (÷25). "Using factors and HCF again!"
- **Begin the triple display** (10 min): Start building the classroom wall display — fraction, decimal, percentage columns. Add the first entries: 1/2 = 0.5, 1/4 = 0.25, 3/4 = 0.75, 1/10 = 0.1, 1/5 = 0.2. "Percentage column coming tomorrow!"
- **Division connection** (10 min): "3/4 as a decimal? Divide: 3 ÷ 4 = 0.75. Use short division!" Link back to Week 2 — remainders as decimals. 1 ÷ 8 = 0.125. "Short division from Week 2 turns fractions into decimals."
- **Practice** (10 min): Convert between fractions and decimals. Include simplifying. Extension: "Find a fraction between 0.3 and 0.4."

### Lesson 25 — Introducing Percentages: Per Cent Means Per Hundred

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | MA-Y5-C010 (Percentages as fractions and decimals) |
| **Cluster** | MA-Y5-D004-CL001 |
| **Objective** | Understand that per cent means "out of 100"; write percentages as fractions with denominator 100 and as decimals; identify key benchmarks |
| **Key vocabulary** | per cent, percentage, %, per hundred, fraction, decimal, equivalent, hundredths grid |
| **Misconception focus** | Writing 5% as 0.5 (confusing with 50%); writing 5% as 5/10 instead of 5/100 |

**Structure**:
- **Etymology** (5 min): "Per cent — from Latin 'per centum' — means 'per hundred' or 'out of 100.' 45% means 45 out of every 100."
- **Hundredths grid** (15 min): 10×10 grid = 100 squares = 100%. Shade 45 squares → 45%. "45 out of 100 = 45/100 = 0.45." Shade 50 → 50% = 50/100 = 1/2 = 0.5. Shade 25 → 25% = 25/100 = 1/4 = 0.25.
- **Key benchmarks** (10 min): 50% = 1/2 = 0.5. 25% = 1/4 = 0.25. 10% = 1/10 = 0.1. 1% = 1/100 = 0.01. "These are the benchmarks we'll build EVERYTHING from."
- **Misconception work** (10 min): "5% as a decimal?" Children write answers on whiteboards. Address 0.5 errors: "5% = 5/100 = 5 hundredths = 0.05. NOT 5 tenths." Physical place value chart: 5 in the hundredths column.
- **Complete the triple display** (10 min): Add percentage column to the wall: 1/2 = 0.5 = 50%, 1/4 = 0.25 = 25%, 3/4 = 0.75 = 75%, 1/10 = 0.1 = 10%, 1/5 = 0.2 = 20%.
- **Exit ticket** (10 min): "Write as a fraction AND a decimal: 30%, 75%, 8%, 1%."

### Lesson 26 — Benchmark Percentages: The Full Set

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | MA-Y5-C010 |
| **Cluster** | MA-Y5-D004-CL002 |
| **Objective** | Know benchmark percentage-fraction-decimal equivalences; derive new percentages from benchmarks (5% = half of 10%, 20% = double 10%) |
| **Key vocabulary** | benchmark, equivalent, derive, halve, double, relationship |

**Structure**:
- **Build the full benchmark table** (15 min):
  - 50% = 1/2 = 0.5 (halving)
  - 25% = 1/4 = 0.25 (halving a half)
  - 75% = 3/4 = 0.75 (three quarters)
  - 10% = 1/10 = 0.1 (dividing by 10)
  - 20% = 1/5 = 0.2 (double 10%, or dividing by 5)
  - 5% = 1/20 = 0.05 (half of 10%)
  - 1% = 1/100 = 0.01 (dividing by 100)
  - 40% = 2/5 = 0.4 (four times 10%)
  - 80% = 4/5 = 0.8 (eight times 10%)
- **Derivation** (10 min): "If you know 10%, you can find almost anything. 30% = 3 × 10%. 15% = 10% + 5%. 35% = 3 × 10% + 5%." Practice deriving from benchmarks.
- **Matching game** (15 min): Triple cards (fraction, decimal, percentage) spread on tables. Race to match them into correct triples. Include tricky ones: 2/5 = 0.4 = 40%, 4/5 = 0.8 = 80%.
- **Fast finisher challenge** (10 min): "Create 5 new triples that aren't in the benchmark table." E.g., 3/8 = 0.375 = 37.5%.
- **Plenary** (10 min): Quick-fire quiz: "What is 25% as a fraction?" "What is 0.1 as a percentage?" "What fraction is 80%?" Speed and automaticity.

### Lesson 27 — Converting Between Fractions, Decimals & Percentages

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | MA-Y5-C010, MA-Y5-C013 |
| **Cluster** | MA-Y5-D004-CL002 |
| **Objective** | Convert fluently between fraction, decimal and percentage forms using division, multiplication by 100, and equivalent fractions |
| **Key vocabulary** | convert, equivalent, divide, multiply by 100, numerator, denominator, simplify |

**Structure**:
- **The conversion routes** (15 min): Teach the full set of conversions:
  - Fraction → decimal: divide numerator by denominator (short division from Week 2)
  - Decimal → fraction: use place value (0.35 = 35/100 = 7/20)
  - Decimal → percentage: multiply by 100 (0.35 × 100 = 35%)
  - Percentage → decimal: divide by 100 (35% ÷ 100 = 0.35)
  - Fraction → percentage: convert to decimal first, then × 100. Or find equivalent fraction with denominator 100.
  - Percentage → fraction: write over 100, simplify (35% = 35/100 = 7/20)
- **Narrate the connections** (5 min): "HCF from Week 1 simplifies fractions. Short division from Week 2 converts fractions to decimals. Equivalent fractions from Week 3 find the fraction form. It ALL connects."
- **Conversion practice** (20 min): 18 conversions — 3 of each type. Start scaffolded (conversion route given), end independent.
- **Sorting challenge** (10 min): "Put these in order from smallest to largest: 0.45, 3/8, 42%, 2/5." Convert all to decimals to compare: 0.45, 0.375, 0.42, 0.4. Order: 3/8, 2/5, 42%, 0.45.
- **Plenary** (10 min): "Which form is easiest for comparing sizes?" (Decimals) "Which form is most natural for 'parts of a whole'?" (Fractions) "Which form do shops use for discounts?" (Percentages) Different forms suit different purposes.

### Lesson 28 — Finding Percentages of Quantities

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | MA-Y5-C010 |
| **Cluster** | MA-Y5-D004-CL002 |
| **Objective** | Find percentages of quantities using benchmark building blocks (10%, 5%, 1%); solve percentage word problems |
| **Key vocabulary** | find, of, percentage, quantity, calculate, discount, sale price |

**Structure**:
- **The 10% method** (10 min): "10% of a number = divide by 10." 10% of 80 = 8. 10% of 350 = 35. 10% of 45 = 4.5.
- **Building from 10%** (15 min):
  - 5% = half of 10%. 5% of 80 = 4.
  - 1% = 10% ÷ 10. 1% of 80 = 0.8.
  - 20% = 2 × 10%. 20% of 80 = 16.
  - 15% = 10% + 5%. 15% of 80 = 8 + 4 = 12.
  - 35% = 3 × 10% + 5%. 35% of 80 = 24 + 4 = 28.
- **Bar model approach** (10 min): "A shirt costs £60. 25% discount. What's the sale price?" Bar = £60. 25% = 1/4. 1/4 of 60 = 15. Sale price = 60 - 15 = £45. Draw the bar, shade the discount, find the remaining price.
- **Word problems** (15 min):
  - "A school has 350 pupils. 40% walk to school. How many walk?" (140)
  - "A recipe serves 4. You want to make 150% of the recipe for 6 people. The recipe needs 200g flour. How much flour for 6?" (300g)
  - "A coat costs £85. There is a 20% sale. What is the sale price?" (£68)
- **Plenary** (10 min): "You now have TWO ways to find a percentage: the building-block method (10%, 5%, 1%) and the fraction method (25% = 1/4, so divide by 4). Choose whichever is easier for the problem."

### Lesson 29 — The Grand Connection: Problem-Solving with All Three Forms

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | MA-Y5-C008, MA-Y5-C009, MA-Y5-C010, MA-Y5-C013 |
| **Cluster** | MA-Y5-D004-CL002 |
| **Objective** | Solve problems requiring conversion between fractions, decimals and percentages; choose the most efficient representation |
| **Key vocabulary** | strategy, representation, efficient, equivalent, convert, compare |

**Structure**:
- **Comparison problems** (15 min):
  - "Which is larger: 3/8 or 40%?" Convert: 3/8 = 0.375 = 37.5%. 40% > 37.5%. So 40% is larger.
  - "Put in order: 0.6, 3/5, 55%, 7/12." Convert all to decimals: 0.6, 0.6, 0.55, 0.583... Order: 55%, 7/12, 3/5 = 0.6.
  - "Is 0.3 the same as 30% of 1?" Yes — 30% = 0.3. "Is 0.3 the same as 30% of 10?" No — 30% of 10 = 3.
- **Mixed representation problems** (15 min):
  - "A jar is 0.6 full of water. What fraction is empty?" 0.6 = 3/5 full → 2/5 empty = 0.4 = 40%.
  - "Tom scored 7/10 on a test. What percentage is that? What decimal?" 70%, 0.7.
  - "A shop discounts by 1/4. What percentage discount is that? A dress costs £48 — what's the sale price?" 25%. £48 - £12 = £36.
- **Gallery walk** (20 min): 8 rich problems displayed around the room (on A3 sheets). Pairs circulate, solving 2 each. Each problem requires choosing the best representation. Pairs write their working clearly. After solving, pairs rotate to a different problem and check another pair's work.
- **Class discussion** (10 min): Share strategies. "Did anyone find a problem where a fraction was easier than a decimal? Where a percentage was most natural?" Build awareness that different representations suit different contexts.
