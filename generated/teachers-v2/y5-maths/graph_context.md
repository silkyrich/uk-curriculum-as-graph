#### MA-Y5-C003: Prime numbers and composite numbers

**Description**: A prime number has exactly two distinct factors: 1 and itself (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19...). A composite number has more than two factors. The number 1 is neither prime nor composite. Mastery means pupils can identify whether any number up to 100 is prime, recall primes up to 19, and explain why 1 is excluded from the definition of prime.

**Teaching guidance**: Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes: start with numbers 2-100, cross out all multiples of 2 (not 2 itself), then all multiples of 3, 5, 7 — the remaining numbers are prime. This systematic approach builds conceptual understanding. Connect to factors: a prime number has only one factor pair (1 and itself). The fact that there are infinitely many primes can be discussed as a fascinating mathematical result. Practise rapid identification of primeness for numbers under 20.

**Key vocabulary**: prime number, composite number, factor, factor pair, divisible, Sieve of Eratosthenes, 1 is not prime

**Common misconceptions**: Pupils frequently include 1 as a prime number (it has only one factor, not two). They may think all odd numbers are prime (9 = 3 × 3 is odd but not prime). The number 2 is the only even prime, which surprises pupils who think 'all primes are odd'. Large-number primeness testing requires systematic factor checking.


#### MA-Y5-C004: Square numbers and cube numbers

**Description**: A square number is the product of an integer with itself: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100... written as n². A cube number is the product of an integer with itself three times: 1, 8, 27, 64, 125... written as n³. Mastery means pupils can list all square numbers up to 144 (12²) and the first five cube numbers, use the notation n² and n³, and connect these to area and volume.

**Teaching guidance**: Use physical square arrays (a 5 × 5 grid of squares = 25 = 5²) and cubic structures (a 3 × 3 × 3 arrangement of cubes = 27 = 3³) to make the concepts concrete. Square numbers connect directly to area of squares (area of a 4 cm square = 4² = 16 cm²); cube numbers connect to volume of cubes (volume of a 3 cm cube = 3³ = 27 cm³). Display a reference chart of squares and cubes. Note that 1 and 64 are both square and cube numbers.

**Key vocabulary**: square number, cube number, squared, cubed, n², n³, power, notation, array

**Common misconceptions**: Pupils confuse squaring with multiplying by 2 (thinking 5² = 10 rather than 25). Similarly, they may think 5³ = 15 (multiplying by 3) rather than 125 (multiplying 5 × 5 × 5). The notation n² is sometimes read as 'n two' rather than 'n squared'. Pupils may not connect square numbers to physical square arrays.


#### MA-Y5-C005: Factors, common factors and multiples

**Description**: Factors of a number divide it exactly; multiples of a number are its products with positive integers. Common factors of two numbers are factors shared by both; the highest common factor (HCF) is the largest. Common multiples are multiples shared by two numbers; the lowest common multiple (LCM) is the smallest. Mastery means pupils can find all factor pairs of any number to 100, identify common factors and HCF of two numbers, identify the LCM of two single-digit numbers, and use these in simplifying fractions and finding common denominators.

**Teaching guidance**: Systematic factor pair listing: start from 1 × n and work upward until the factors meet in the middle (e.g. for 24: 1×24, 2×12, 3×8, 4×6 — stop at 4 because 5 does not divide 24 exactly and 5 × 5 = 25 > 24). Venn diagrams showing factors of two numbers overlap at their common factors. Connect directly to fractions: HCF is used to simplify (24/36: HCF is 12, so 24/36 = 2/3); LCM is used to find common denominators (adding 1/4 + 1/6: LCM of 4 and 6 is 12).

**Key vocabulary**: factor, multiple, factor pair, common factor, highest common factor, HCF, common multiple, lowest common multiple, LCM, divisible

**Common misconceptions**: Factors and multiples are persistently confused: factors divide a number (factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12); multiples are the products of multiplying a number by positive integers (multiples of 12 are 12, 24, 36...). When finding common factors, pupils often stop after finding one rather than listing all. HCF is confused with product of factors.


#### MA-Y5-C006: Long multiplication (4-digit × 2-digit)

**Description**: Long multiplication extends short multiplication to a two-digit multiplier. The product is computed as the sum of two partial products: one where the multiplier is the ones digit (with the result placed on the first line) and one where the multiplier is the tens digit (with the result indented by one place, equivalent to multiplying by ten). Mastery means pupils can reliably compute any up-to four-digit number multiplied by any two-digit number using the formal long multiplication method.

**Teaching guidance**: Build from short multiplication. Show that 47 × 23 = 47 × 20 + 47 × 3 = 940 + 141 = 1081 using grid method first. Then show how this is compressed into the long multiplication layout: first row: 47 × 3 = 141; second row: 47 × 20 = 940 (written with 0 in the ones column as a placeholder, then multiplied by 2 for the tens); add the two rows: 141 + 940 = 1081. Estimation before multiplying: 47 × 23 ≈ 50 × 20 = 1000, so 1081 is plausible.

**Key vocabulary**: long multiplication, partial product, placeholder, indent, two-digit multiplier, ones, tens, formal method, carry

**Common misconceptions**: The most common error is forgetting to write the zero placeholder in the second row (so the tens product is not shifted left correctly). Pupils also forget to add carries from the first row before starting the second. Some pupils treat long multiplication as two separate short multiplications and forget to add the partial products at the end.


#### MA-Y5-C007: Short division with remainders

**Description**: Short division (the 'bus stop' method) divides a multi-digit number by a single-digit number, recording the working compactly above the number. In Year 5, this extends to four-digit dividends, and remainders must be interpreted appropriately — as a whole number remainder, as a fraction, or by rounding up or down depending on context. Mastery means pupils can accurately complete any four-digit ÷ one-digit calculation using short division and interpret the remainder correctly for the problem context.

**Teaching guidance**: Establish the procedure with two-digit ÷ one-digit first to consolidate the method. Extend to three then four digits. The critical skill is interpreting remainders: dividing 43 children into groups of 5: 43 ÷ 5 = 8 remainder 3 → 9 groups needed (round up for groups of people). Dividing £43 equally among 5 people: 43 ÷ 5 = £8.60 (express as a decimal). Share 43 biscuits equally among 5: 43 ÷ 5 = 8 with 3 left over (whole number remainder). Context determines the form of the answer.

**Key vocabulary**: short division, bus stop method, dividend, divisor, quotient, remainder, interpret, round up, round down, fraction, context

**Common misconceptions**: Pupils forget to bring down a digit when there is a remainder from one column to the next, particularly when a zero appears in the quotient (e.g. 3024 ÷ 4 = 756, where 0 ÷ 4 = 0 must still be written). Interpreting remainders contextually is frequently missed — pupils give a remainder answer when the context requires rounding.

## Domain: Number - Fractions (including Decimals and Percentages) (MA-Y5-D004)

- **Subject**: Mathematics
- **Year**: Y5
- **Structure type**: hierarchical

**Curriculum context**: In Year 5, fractions become significantly more complex: pupils add and subtract fractions with different denominators using equivalent fractions (requiring LCM knowledge), multiply proper fractions and mixed numbers by whole numbers, and convert between mixed numbers and improper fractions. The non-statutory guidance explains that pupils connect fractions to division (a/b = a ÷ b) and use this connection to find equivalences. Percentages are introduced as a special form of fraction (per hundred)


### Statutory Objectives (12)

- **MA-Y5-O021** (statutory): compare and order fractions whose denominators are all multiples of the same number
- **MA-Y5-O022** (statutory): identify, name and write equivalent fractions of a given fraction, represented visually, including tenths and hundredths
- **MA-Y5-O023** (statutory): recognise mixed numbers and improper fractions and convert from one form to the other and write mathematical statements > 1 as a mixed number [for example, 2/5 + 4/5 = 6/5 = 1 1/5]

#### MA-Y5-C008: Adding and subtracting fractions with different denominators

**Description**: To add or subtract fractions with different denominators, both fractions must be expressed with a common denominator using equivalent fractions. The lowest common multiple of the denominators gives the most efficient common denominator. For example, 1/3 + 1/4: LCM of 3 and 4 is 12; 1/3 = 4/12, 1/4 = 3/12; 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12. Mastery means pupils can find a common denominator, convert both fractions, add or subtract, and simplify if possible.

**Teaching guidance**: Begin with denominators where one is a multiple of the other (1/4 + 1/8: 1/4 = 2/8, so 2/8 + 1/8 = 3/8 — only one fraction needs converting). Extend to cases requiring LCM (1/3 + 1/4 as above). Use fraction bars to show equivalence visually before computing abstractly. Connect to LCM knowledge from number theory. When results exceed 1 whole, convert to mixed number (7/5 = 1 2/5).

**Key vocabulary**: common denominator, equivalent fraction, lowest common multiple, LCM, numerator, denominator, add, subtract, simplify, mixed number

**Common misconceptions**: The classic error is adding numerators and denominators independently (1/3 + 1/4 = 2/7). Pupils who do not find a common denominator first will always make this error. When only one denominator needs converting, some pupils convert both unnecessarily and make errors. Forgetting to simplify the answer (leaving 6/9 instead of 2/3) is also common.


#### MA-Y5-C009: Mixed numbers and improper fractions

**Description**: An improper fraction has a numerator greater than or equal to its denominator (e.g. 7/4). A mixed number expresses the same value as a whole number and a proper fraction (e.g. 1 3/4). Converting between them: 7/4 = 4/4 + 3/4 = 1 + 3/4 = 1 3/4; and 2 3/5 = (2 × 5 + 3)/5 = 13/5. Mastery means pupils convert fluently in both directions, understand that the two forms represent identical values, and can position both on a number line.

**Teaching guidance**: Use a number line with fractions and whole numbers marked: 0, 1/4, 2/4 (=1/2), 3/4, 4/4 (=1), 5/4 (=1 1/4)... This makes the continuity of fractions beyond 1 visible. For converting improper to mixed: divide numerator by denominator (the quotient is the whole number; the remainder is the new numerator over the same denominator). For mixed to improper: multiply whole number by denominator and add numerator.

**Key vocabulary**: mixed number, improper fraction, convert, equivalent, numerator, denominator, whole number, number line, remainder

**Common misconceptions**: When converting mixed to improper, pupils forget to add the numerator after multiplying (computing 2 × 5 = 10 for 2 3/5 and writing 10/5 rather than 13/5). When converting improper to mixed, pupils who use the division method may not write the remainder as a fraction (writing quotient as the answer without a remainder fraction). They may also think improper fractions are 'wrong' rather than a valid form.


#### MA-Y5-C010: Percentages as fractions and decimals

**Description**: Percent means 'per hundred' (from Latin per centum). A percentage is therefore a fraction with denominator 100: 45% = 45/100 = 0.45. Common equivalences to know: 50% = 1/2 = 0.5; 25% = 1/4 = 0.25; 10% = 1/10 = 0.1; 1% = 1/100 = 0.01; 20% = 1/5 = 0.2. Mastery means pupils can convert between percentage, fraction and decimal forms for all common equivalences and for any percentage, and can find a percentage of a quantity.

**Teaching guidance**: Use a hundredths grid (100 squares representing 100%): shade 45 squares to show 45%. Money provides a natural percentage context: 50% of £80 = £40 (half). Teach the three forms side by side: fraction, decimal, percentage. Building up from known benchmarks: 50% is a half, 25% is a quarter, 10% is a tenth, then 5% = half of 10%, 20% = double 10% etc. Finding a percentage: multiply by the decimal equivalent (35% of 60 = 0.35 × 60 = 21).

**Key vocabulary**: percent, percentage, %, per hundred, fraction, decimal, equivalent, convert, find a percentage, of, hundredths

**Common misconceptions**: Pupils sometimes think 'per cent' and 'percentage points' are interchangeable in all contexts. They may write 5% as 0.5 (rather than 0.05) or as 5/10 (rather than 5/100). Converting 0.07 to a percentage: some pupils say 7% (correct) but others say 70% (multiplying by 10 rather than 100). The relationship between percentage and decimal requires multiplying or dividing by 100, not 10.


#### MA-Y5-C013: Thousandths and decimal place value to 3 decimal places

**Description**: A thousandth is 1/1000 = 0.001 — the third decimal place. Extending decimal place value to three places allows measurement to the nearest millimetre (1 mm = 0.001 m), weight to nearest gram (1 g = 0.001 kg), and volume to nearest millilitre. Mastery means pupils can read, write, order and compare numbers with up to three decimal places, identify the value of any digit, and connect decimal and fraction notation for thousandths.

**Teaching guidance**: Extend the place value chart to include tenths, hundredths and thousandths columns. Use a number line from 0 to 1 marked in 0.001 steps (or at key reference points) for ordering. Measurement contexts: a 5 km race recorded as 4.876 km = 4 km 876 m; a mass of 2.345 kg = 2 kg 345 g. Connect to division: 3 ÷ 1000 = 0.003 (three thousandths). Compare numbers with 3 decimal places column by column from left.

**Key vocabulary**: thousandth, 0.001, 1/1000, three decimal places, place value, tenths, hundredths, compare, order, decimal point

**Common misconceptions**: Pupils compare decimals with different numbers of decimal places incorrectly: thinking 0.4 > 0.35 might be true (correct) but thinking 0.035 > 0.4 because 35 > 4 (incorrect — confusing place values). The word 'thousandths' is confused with 'thousands', leading to errors when moving between large and small numbers. Writing 0.003 as 3/1000 is secure; writing 3/1000 as 0.003 is less so.
