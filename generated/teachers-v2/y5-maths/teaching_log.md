## Planning Phase

### Entry 1 — First Impressions of the Graph Context

Right. I've been handed this graph context and told to plan Autumn 1 around fractions, decimals and percentages. First thing that jumps out: the system has given me *two* domains, not one. MA-Y5-D003 (Multiplication and Division) and MA-Y5-D004 (Fractions). At first I thought — hang on, I asked for fractions, why am I getting multiplication and division? Then I looked at the prerequisites and it clicked. The fractions domain *needs* the number theory from D003. Specifically:

> MA-Y5-C005 (Factors, common factors and multiples) from MA-Y5-D003 --> MA-Y5-C008 (Adding and subtracting fractions with different denominators)

You cannot teach adding fractions with different denominators without LCM. And LCM lives in the multiplication and division domain. The graph has surfaced a dependency that's absolutely real — I've seen it every year. Children who don't have secure factor/multiple knowledge *cannot* find common denominators. They just can't. So the graph is right to bundle these together.

### Entry 2 — Reacting to "Only 5 Clusters for 9 Concepts"

Five clusters. Nine concepts. Thirty lessons. My first honest reaction: is that *enough* structure?

Let me look at what the algorithm has produced:

**D003**: 3 clusters (Introduction → Practice → Assessment) for 5 concepts across 25 lessons
**D004**: 2 clusters (Introduction → Assessment) for 4 concepts across 26 lessons

That's 51 suggested lesson-slots across 5 clusters for only 30 actual lessons. So the first practical reality is that I'm compressing. The cluster scaffolding is *too generous* in total — it assumes I'm teaching each domain in isolation with its own full cycle. I'm not. I'm weaving them together because the mathematics demands it.

The D003 clusters are reasonable in shape — introduction, practice, assessment is a sensible three-act structure for number properties and formal methods. But 25 lessons for 5 concepts that are partly revision from Year 4? That's lavish. My children already know short multiplication and have started short division. They know their times tables (mostly — I'll be checking). Primes and squares are new, but they're *knowledge* concepts at complexity 3. They don't need 8 lessons of practice each.

The D004 clusters concern me more. Only TWO clusters for the hardest content of the year? An introduction cluster with *all four concepts* lumped together and then an assessment cluster repeating the same four? That's too flat. Adding fractions with different denominators (complexity 4, weight 4) is significantly harder than understanding what a percentage is (complexity 3, weight 3). They shouldn't be in the same introductory cluster treated as equals.

**My verdict**: The clusters give me a useful starting skeleton — they confirm the introduction-before-assessment sequencing and the domain dependency order (D003 before D004). But I need to break D004 down much further. I'll create my own sub-phases within the D004 work: fractions operations first, then decimals, then percentages, building the connection progressively.

### Entry 3 — Cross-Domain Integration: The Graph's Blind Spot

The graph treats D003 and D004 as separate domains with a prerequisite link between them. That's architecturally clean but pedagogically limiting. In my classroom, these aren't separate topics that happen to connect — they're *the same mathematical story* told through different representations.

Here's what I mean. When I teach factors and LCM in Week 1, I'm not teaching "multiplication and division" — I'm laying the foundation for *finding common denominators*. Every LCM example I use will be framed as "and this is why we need this for fractions." When we find LCM of 4 and 6, I'll immediately show 1/4 + 1/6 with fraction bars and say "see — twelfths is where they meet."

When I teach short division with remainders, I'll connect the remainder to fractions: 7 ÷ 4 = 1 remainder 3, but also 7 ÷ 4 = 1 3/4. That's the fraction-division connection (a/b = a ÷ b) that the non-statutory guidance explicitly calls out.

When we reach decimals, I'll loop back to division again: 3 ÷ 4 = 0.75 = 75/100 = 75%. The formal methods from D003 generate the decimals and fractions from D004.

The graph's cluster sequencing *helps* here — it puts D003 first, which is correct. But it *hinders* by not surfacing the cross-domain connections as teaching moments. There's no co-teaching signal between, say, C007 (Short division with remainders) and C009 (Mixed numbers and improper fractions), even though interpreting a division remainder as a fraction is one of the most important conceptual bridges in Year 5 maths. I'd love to see a co-teaching link there.

The co-teaching signals it *does* give me are:
- **Factors ↔ Primes** (extracted) — yes, obviously, they're defined in terms of each other
- **Long multiplication ↔ Short division** (inverse operations) — useful for checking work but not a deep teaching connection

Both of these are within D003. There are *no* co-teaching signals between D003 and D004, which misses the biggest pedagogical story of this half-term.

### Entry 4 — The Fraction-Decimal-Percentage Connection

This is the mountain we climb every Year 5. Children arrive thinking fractions, decimals and percentages are three completely different things. Our job is to show they're three ways of writing the same number.

The graph gives me useful structure here. The prerequisite chain is:

```
MA-Y4-C010 (Hundredths and decimal place value)
    └──> MA-Y5-C010 (Percentages as fractions and decimals)
    └──> MA-Y5-C013 (Thousandths and decimal place value to 3 dp)
```

So both percentage understanding and thousandths understanding build on Year 4 hundredths work. That's correct. The graph also places C010 (Percentages) and C013 (Thousandths) in the same cluster, which makes sense — you can't fully understand percentages without secure decimal place value.

The teaching guidance for C010 is excellent: "Use a hundredths grid (100 squares representing 100%): shade 45 squares to show 45%." That's exactly right. And "Building up from known benchmarks: 50% is a half, 25% is a quarter, 10% is a tenth, then 5% = half of 10%, 20% = double 10%." Perfect progression.

What I'll add that the graph doesn't capture: the **triple representation** approach. Every single fraction/decimal/percentage lesson from Week 5 onwards will have a three-column display on the working wall:

| Fraction | Decimal | Percentage |
|----------|---------|------------|
| 1/2      | 0.5     | 50%        |
| 1/4      | 0.25    | 25%        |
| 3/4      | 0.75    | 75%        |
| 1/10     | 0.1     | 10%        |
| 1/5      | 0.2     | 20%        |

We build this up over the final two weeks. Children add to it as they discover new equivalences. By the end, it's their reference chart and — more importantly — it embeds the idea that these are *the same numbers written differently*.

### Entry 5 — Grouping Decisions: 9 Concepts in 30 Lessons

Nine concepts. Thirty lessons. That's a mean of 3.3 lessons per concept. But a mean is useless here because these concepts are wildly different in difficulty.

Here's my actual allocation:

| Concept | ID | Lessons | Rationale |
|---------|-----|---------|-----------|
| Factors, common factors and multiples | C005 | 3 | Essential prerequisite for fractions; partly builds on Y4 factor pairs |
| Prime numbers and composite numbers | C003 | 2 | Knowledge concept; Sieve activity is engaging and efficient |
| Square and cube numbers | C004 | 1.5 | Knowledge concept; concrete with arrays/cubes; share lesson with review |
| Long multiplication | C006 | 2 | Extending Y4 short multiplication; bridging grid → formal |
| Short division with remainders | C007 | 2 | Extending Y4 work; critical for remainder interpretation |
| Mixed numbers and improper fractions | C009 | 3 | Foundational for all fraction operations; needs visual grounding |
| Adding/subtracting fractions (different denominators) | C008 | 6 | THE hardest concept; needs extensive CPA progression |
| Thousandths and decimal place value | C013 | 4 | New content; ordering/comparing decimals needs practice |
| Percentages as fractions and decimals | C010 | 5 | New concept + the critical F-D-P connection work |
| Assessment & consolidation | — | 2 | Mid-unit check (L20) + end-of-unit assessment (L30) |

That's 30.5 lessons — I'll absorb the half by combining squares/cubes with a review lesson.

Notice C008 (Adding/subtracting fractions with different denominators) gets **6 full lessons** — double the mean. This is deliberate. This concept has:
- Complexity 4, weight 4 (the highest in both domains)
- The most dangerous misconception in primary maths: adding numerators and denominators independently (1/3 + 1/4 = 2/7)
- Multiple sub-skills: finding common denominator, converting both fractions, operating, simplifying, converting to mixed number
- A dependency on C005 (LCM) that children need time to internalise

By contrast, C003 (Primes) gets only 2 lessons because it's a knowledge concept at complexity 3 with a self-contained and satisfying teaching approach (the Sieve). Children either get it or they don't — more lessons won't help as much as returning to it throughout the year.

### Entry 6 — Where I Agree and Disagree with the Clusters

**Agreements:**

1. **D003 before D004** — absolutely right. The prerequisite dependency is real and non-negotiable. I must teach factors/LCM before fraction operations.

2. **The D003 Introduction cluster grouping** — putting primes, squares, and factors together makes sense. They're all "number properties" and they naturally co-teach. Knowing factors helps identify primes (a prime has exactly one factor pair). Squares and cubes connect to factors (square numbers have an odd number of factors). The co-teaching signal between C003 and C005 is spot-on.

3. **Long multiplication and short division co-teaching** — the inverse operations signal is correct. I'll teach them in the same week so children can use one to check the other (multiply answer by divisor to verify division).

4. **All D004 concepts need an introduction phase** — yes. No shortcuts here. Every one of these concepts needs careful building from concrete to abstract.

**Disagreements:**

1. **The D003 Practice cluster (CL002) allocating 8 lessons to just long multiplication and short division** — far too many. These are extensions of Year 4 methods, not brand-new concepts. My children have been doing short multiplication since Y3 and short division since Y4. Two lessons each is plenty, with one more for problem-solving.

2. **The D003 Assessment cluster (CL003) repeating the same concepts for another 8 lessons** — this is where the algorithm shows its limitations. It doesn't know what my class can already do. I'll compress the entire D003 assessment into one lesson (L10) and use the diagnostic information to plan intervention groups.

3. **The D004 Introduction cluster lumping all 4 concepts together** — this is my biggest disagreement. C008 (fraction operations) and C009 (mixed numbers) are deeply intertwined and should be taught as a connected pair over Weeks 3-4. C013 (thousandths) and C010 (percentages) are a different strand that should come in Weeks 5-6. Lumping them all together doesn't reflect the teaching reality: you need fraction operation fluency *before* you can meaningfully connect fractions to decimals and percentages.

4. **No mid-point assessment in D004** — two clusters (Introduction then Assessment) means children go through 13 lessons of new content before any formal check. That's too long. I've inserted a mid-unit check at L20 (end of Week 4) so I can catch fraction misconceptions before layering on decimals and percentages.

5. **Missing consolidation cluster type** — the algorithm produces Introduction, Practice, and Assessment clusters for D003 but only Introduction and Assessment for D004. Where's the Practice cluster for fractions? This is the domain where children most need deliberate practice with varied examples. I'll build extensive practice into Weeks 3-4 myself, but the graph should be generating this.

### Entry 7 — CPA Progression: Making the Abstract Concrete

The complexity_level ratings in the graph are useful signposts:

- **Complexity 3** (C003, C004, C005, C009, C010, C013): These are either knowledge concepts or skills that can be grounded in concrete experience relatively easily.
- **Complexity 4** (C006, C007, C008): These are formal methods and operations that require significant scaffolding.

My CPA (Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract) progression for each major concept:

**Factors and multiples (C005, complexity 3)**
- Concrete: Multilink cube arrays — "How many different rectangles can you make with 24 cubes?"
- Pictorial: Factor pair T-charts, Venn diagrams for common factors
- Abstract: Systematic factor listing, HCF/LCM calculation

**Primes (C003, complexity 3)**
- Concrete: Multilink cubes — "Can you make a rectangle (not a line) with 7 cubes? What about 9?"
- Pictorial: Sieve of Eratosthenes on a 100-grid (this IS the lesson)
- Abstract: Prime identification by systematic factor checking

**Squares and cubes (C004, complexity 3)**
- Concrete: Physical square arrays and cubic structures (multilink cubes arranged in 3D)
- Pictorial: Dot arrays, cubic drawings with dimensions labelled
- Abstract: n² and n³ notation, connection to area and volume formulae

**Long multiplication (C006, complexity 4)**
- Concrete: Base-10 blocks for place value understanding (very briefly — this is revision)
- Pictorial: Grid method as visual bridge to formal layout
- Abstract: Formal long multiplication column method

**Short division (C007, complexity 4)**
- Concrete: Sharing using place value counters (very briefly — revision)
- Pictorial: The bus stop layout itself is semi-pictorial
- Abstract: Formal short division with contextual remainder interpretation

**Mixed numbers and improper fractions (C009, complexity 3)**
- Concrete: Fraction circles — physically putting together more than one whole
- Pictorial: Number line with fractions marked beyond 1 (0, 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 6/4...)
- Abstract: Division method for conversion (numerator ÷ denominator)

**Adding/subtracting fractions (C008, complexity 4) — THE BIG ONE**
- Concrete: Fraction wall — physically comparing lengths, finding where they "meet"
- Pictorial: Fraction bars / bar models drawn and shaded — showing equivalent fractions side by side
- Abstract: LCM method for common denominator → convert → operate → simplify

This concept gets the longest CPA progression because the misconception (1/3 + 1/4 = 2/7) is *so* resistant to correction. Children need to SEE with fraction bars that 1/3 + 1/4 is obviously more than 1/2, so 2/7 (which is less than 1/2) can't possibly be right. The visual contradiction breaks the misconception open.

**Thousandths (C013, complexity 3)**
- Concrete: Metre sticks marked in mm (1 mm = 0.001 m); weighing in grams (1g = 0.001 kg)
- Pictorial: Place value chart extended to thousandths column
- Abstract: Reading, writing, ordering and comparing to 3 decimal places

**Percentages (C010, complexity 3)**
- Concrete: Hundredths grid — shade squares, count the percentage
- Pictorial: Bar models split into 100 parts (or 10 × 10 grids)
- Abstract: Conversion calculations, finding percentages of quantities

### Entry 8 — Common Misconceptions: The Graph's Most Valuable Contribution

If I'm honest, the most useful thing in this entire graph context is the misconception data. Every concept has specific, named misconceptions that I recognise from years of teaching. Let me flag the ones that will shape my planning most:

**"1 is a prime number"** (C003) — I will address this head-on in L4 with "The trial of the number 1" — a class discussion where we put 1 on trial. Does it meet the definition? It has only ONE factor (not two), so it doesn't qualify. Making it dramatic makes it memorable.

**"All odd numbers are prime"** (C003) — Counter-example: 9 = 3 × 3. I'll prepare a sorting activity: odd numbers into "prime" and "not prime" columns.

**"5² = 10" (squaring means multiplying by 2)** (C004) — This is notation confusion. I'll use physical arrays: "Make a square with 5 rows and 5 columns. How many altogether?" Then introduce the notation. The visual grounds the notation in meaning.

**"Factors and multiples are the same thing"** (C005) — I hear this EVERY year. My mnemonic: "Factors are Few, Multiples are Many." Factors of 12: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12} — a small set. Multiples of 12: {12, 24, 36, 48...} — goes on forever.

**"Forgetting the placeholder zero in long multiplication"** (C006) — The most common procedural error. I use a physical place-holder card (a bright orange zero card) that children place in the ones column before writing the second partial product. When they internalise the method, the card goes away.

**"Zero in the quotient"** (C007) — 3024 ÷ 4 where children skip the zero. I'll use place value counters to show that "zero hundreds ÷ 4 = zero hundreds, and we must write that zero."

**"1/3 + 1/4 = 2/7"** (C008) — THE misconception. The fraction wall demolishes this. If children can see that 1/3 is about a third of the wall and 1/4 is about a quarter, then together they're more than half the wall. But 2/7 is less than a third. It can't be right. Visual disproof first, then teach the correct method.

**"Forgetting to add the numerator when converting mixed to improper"** (C009) — 2 3/5 → computing 2 × 5 = 10 → writing 10/5 instead of 13/5. I'll use the mnemonic: "Multiply and ADD" with an emphasis on the "and add" bit. Number line verification: 2 3/5 is between 2 and 3, but 10/5 = 2 exactly. Does that look right?

**"5% = 0.5"** (C010) — Confusing percentage-to-decimal conversion. I'll hammer the rule: "Percentage to decimal: divide by 100 (move the point two places left). Decimal to percentage: multiply by 100 (move the point two places right)." And physically demonstrate: 5 ÷ 100 = 0.05 (five hundredths, not five tenths).

**"0.35 > 0.4 because 35 > 4"** (C013) — The classic decimal comparison error. Column-by-column comparison is the cure: write the numbers so the decimal points align, compare digit by digit from left. If necessary, "pad with zeros": 0.4 = 0.400, and 0.400 > 0.350. But I prefer the place value understanding: 0.4 is 4 tenths; 0.35 is 3 tenths and 5 hundredths. 4 tenths > 3 tenths. Done.

## Week-by-Week Teaching Reflections

### Week 1: Number Properties (D003-CL001)

**Monday (L1: Factor pairs)** — Strong start. The Multilink rectangle activity worked beautifully: "Find every rectangle you can make with 36 cubes." Children naturally discovered all factor pairs: 1×36, 2×18, 3×12, 4×9, 6×6. I modelled the systematic listing from 1 upward and stopping when factors repeat. Most children grasped "stop when the factors meet in the middle." Lower group needed scaffolding — I gave them the first factor of each pair.

**Tuesday (L2: Common factors and HCF)** — Used Venn diagrams: factors of 24 in one circle, factors of 36 in the other, common factors in the overlap. Children loved the visual — it makes the "common" part tangible. Introduced HCF as "the biggest number in the overlap." I explicitly said: "Remember this. In three weeks, we'll use HCF to simplify fractions. This is the tool you'll need." Planting the seed now.

**Wednesday (L3: Multiples and LCM)** — Started with skip counting on number lines (multiples of 4 in blue, multiples of 6 in red — where do they meet? 12, 24, 36...). LCM = the first meeting point. Then I said: "When we add fractions like 1/4 + 1/6, we need to find a common denominator. That's the LCM. Twelve." A few children lit up. Most looked bemused. That's fine — the connection will solidify when we reach fractions.

Key moment: the factors vs multiples confusion surfaced exactly as predicted. "Miss, factors and multiples are the same thing, right?" Used the mnemonic: Factors are Few, Multiples are Many. Made them write it in their maths journals.

**Thursday (L4: Prime numbers)** — The Sieve of Eratosthenes was the star lesson of the week. Gave every child a 1-100 grid, and we crossed out multiples step by step: cross out multiples of 2 (except 2)... multiples of 3 (except 3)... multiples of 5... multiples of 7. The survivors are prime. The gasps when children saw the pattern emerge! "Miss, there are loads of primes between 1 and 50 but hardly any between 50 and 100!"

"The trial of the number 1" went well. I put a large "1" in the witness stand (a chair at the front). "The charge: impersonating a prime number. The evidence: it has only ONE factor — itself. A prime must have EXACTLY TWO factors. Verdict?" The class was unanimous: guilty. Not a prime. They'll remember.

The "all odd numbers are prime" misconception appeared on cue. I wrote 9 on the board. "Odd?" Yes. "Prime?" Most said yes. "What are its factors?" 1, 3, 9. "Three factors. Is it prime?" Penny drops.

**Friday (L5: Square and cube numbers + review)** — Physical arrays for squares (3×3 = 9, 4×4 = 16, 5×5 = 25) and Multilink cube structures for cubes (2×2×2 = 8, 3×3×3 = 27). The 5² ≠ 10 misconception was pre-empted: I asked them to make the square array FIRST, count the total, THEN I introduced the notation. Nobody said 5² = 10 because they'd already counted 25 cubes in their 5×5 array. The notation came after the understanding. That's the right order.

Connected squares to factors: "How many factors does a square number have? Let's check." 16: {1, 2, 4, 8, 16} — five factors. 25: {1, 5, 25} — three factors. 36: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36} — nine factors. "Square numbers always have an ODD number of factors. Why?" Because one factor pair is the number with itself (4×4 for 16), so it only counts once. Beautiful mathematics.

Quick-fire review quiz at the end covering all of Week 1: factors, HCF, LCM, primes, squares, cubes. Most of the class scored 8/10 or above. Three children need same-day intervention on LCM — they're confusing it with HCF.

### Week 2: Formal Written Methods (D003-CL002 / CL003)

**Monday (L6: Long multiplication — bridge from grid)** — Started with the grid method (which they know from Y4) for 47 × 23. Then showed how the formal method is just a compressed version of the same thing. Side-by-side comparison on the board:

Grid: 40×20=800, 40×3=120, 7×20=140, 7×3=21 → 800+120+140+21 = 1081
Formal: 47×3=141 (first row), 47×20=940 (second row), 141+940=1081

"Same calculation, different layout." Children who could see the connection moved to the formal method confidently. Those who couldn't see it stayed with the grid for one more day. Differentiation built in.

Estimation as a checking tool: "47 × 23... round to 50 × 20 = 1000. So our answer should be near 1000. Is 1081 near 1000? Yes. Tick."

**Tuesday (L7: Long multiplication fluency)** — Practised with increasing digit counts: 3-digit × 2-digit, then 4-digit × 2-digit. The placeholder zero error appeared as predicted — four children wrote the second partial product starting in the ones column. Introduced the orange zero card as a physical reminder. By the end of the lesson, only one child still needed it.

**Wednesday (L8: Short division — consolidation)** — Quick refresh of the bus stop method with 2-digit ÷ 1-digit, then extended to 3-digit and 4-digit dividends. The "zero in the quotient" misconception surfaced with 4032 ÷ 4: several children wrote 18 instead of 1008. Used place value counters to physically model: "4 thousands ÷ 4 = 1 thousand. Zero hundreds ÷ 4 = zero hundreds. 3 tens ÷ 4 = 0 remainder 3. Carry the 3 to make 32 ones. 32 ÷ 4 = 8." Writing each digit in its correct column.

**Thursday (L9: Interpreting remainders)** — This is where maths meets the real world. Three problems, same calculation (43 ÷ 5 = 8 remainder 3):

1. "43 children go on a trip. Each minibus holds 5 children. How many minibuses?" → 9 (round UP — you can't leave 3 children behind)
2. "Share £43 equally among 5 people." → £8.60 (express remainder as decimal — this connects to fractions/decimals!)
3. "43 biscuits shared equally among 5 plates." → 8 biscuits per plate, 3 left over (whole number remainder)

The second problem was my bridge moment: "8 remainder 3... but 3 out of 5 is 3/5 of a pound... and 3/5 = 0.6... so £8.60." Children's eyes widened. The remainder IS a fraction. This is the D003→D004 bridge the graph doesn't explicitly signal.

**Friday (L10: D003 Assessment)** — Short written assessment covering all 5 D003 concepts. 15 questions: factor pairs, HCF, LCM, prime identification, square/cube numbers, long multiplication (2 questions), short division with remainder interpretation (3 questions including contextual). Results:

- Secure (12+/15): 21 children
- Developing (8-11/15): 6 children (mostly LCM and remainder interpretation)
- Emerging (below 8): 3 children (need intervention on basic factor/multiple distinction)

The 3 emerging children will join my morning intervention group next week while we start fractions. They need factors/multiples to be solid before they can access common denominators.

### Week 3: Fractions — Building Understanding (D004-CL001)

**Monday (L11: Equivalent fractions — the key to everything)** — I know the graph doesn't list "equivalent fractions" as a separate Y5 concept — it's a Year 4 prerequisite (MA-Y4-C011). But I've learned the hard way: you cannot assume it's secure. So I spent a full lesson on it.

Fraction wall activity: children physically comparing strips. "Find as many fractions equal to 1/2 as you can." → 2/4, 3/6, 4/8, 5/10, 6/12. "What's the rule?" Multiply (or divide) top and bottom by the same number. This is the key to EVERYTHING that follows.

Extended to: "Write 3/5 as an equivalent fraction with denominator 20." → 3/5 = 12/20 (multiply both by 4). "How did you know to multiply by 4?" Because 5 × 4 = 20. "So you used your FACTOR knowledge from last week." Connection made explicitly.

**Tuesday (L12: Mixed numbers and improper fractions — introduction)** — Started with fraction circles. "Show me 7/4 using these circles." Children physically assemble one whole circle (4/4) and then 3/4 of another. "So 7/4 = 1 and 3/4 = 1 3/4." The physical manipulation makes the equivalence obvious.

Moved to number line: marked 0, 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4 (=1), 5/4, 6/4, 7/4, 8/4 (=2)... Children could see that fractions continue beyond 1, and that every "whole number" landing point has the denominator as its numerator (4/4=1, 8/4=2, 12/4=3).

Addressed the misconception that improper fractions are "wrong" or "bad" — they're just a different way of writing the same value. Both forms are valid; different contexts prefer different forms.

**Wednesday (L13: Converting between forms — fluency)** — Taught the algorithmic methods:

Improper → Mixed: divide numerator by denominator. 17/5 → 17÷5 = 3 remainder 2 → 3 2/5.
Mixed → Improper: multiply whole by denominator, add numerator. 3 2/5 → (3×5)+2 = 17 → 17/5.

The "forgetting to add the numerator" misconception appeared immediately: several children wrote 3 2/5 = 15/5 instead of 17/5. Used number line verification: "3 2/5 is between 3 and 4. Is 15/5 between 3 and 4? 15/5 = 3. That's exactly 3, not between 3 and 4. Something went wrong." The estimation check catches the error.

Fluency practice: 20 conversions in both directions, timed. Most children reached automaticity by the end.

**Thursday (L14: Adding fractions — same denominator, then related)** — Step 1: same denominator. 2/7 + 3/7 = 5/7. "Why can we just add the numerators?" Because the denominator tells us the SIZE of the pieces, and they're the same size. We're just counting pieces. Fraction bar model confirms.

Step 2: one denominator is a multiple of the other. 1/4 + 3/8. "Can we add these directly?" No — the pieces are different sizes. "Which denominator can we use?" 8 (because 8 is a multiple of 4). Convert: 1/4 = 2/8. Now: 2/8 + 3/8 = 5/8. Only ONE fraction needed converting.

Fraction bar models throughout. Children physically laid bars side by side to verify.

**Friday (L15: Subtracting fractions — same denominator, then related)** — Same progression as Thursday but with subtraction. 5/8 - 3/8 = 2/8 = 1/4 (and we simplify!). Then: 3/4 - 1/8 → convert 3/4 = 6/8 → 6/8 - 1/8 = 5/8.

Key teaching point: always check if the answer can be simplified. Used HCF from Week 1: "6/8 — HCF of 6 and 8 is 2 — so 6/8 = 3/4." The Week 1 learning pays off.

Word problems at the end: "Ava ate 3/8 of a pizza. Ben ate 1/4. How much did they eat altogether?" Children had to choose the operation AND find the common denominator. Higher group tackled: "How much pizza is left?"

### Week 4: Fractions — Depth and Fluency (D004-CL001 continued)

**Monday (L16: Adding/subtracting with truly different denominators)** — The big lesson. "1/3 + 1/4." Neither denominator is a multiple of the other. What do we do?

I held up fraction bars: 1/3 bar and 1/4 bar side by side. "These don't line up at all. We need to find a size that BOTH can be converted to." This is where LCM comes in. "LCM of 3 and 4?" Children calculated: 12. "So we convert both to twelfths. 1/3 = 4/12. 1/4 = 3/12. Now: 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12."

Before teaching the method, I deliberately provoked the classic misconception. I asked: "What would happen if we just added the tops and the bottoms? 1/3 + 1/4 = 2/7?" I held up fraction bars for 1/3 and 1/4 — together they're clearly MORE than half the bar. Then I held up 2/7 — it's clearly LESS than half. "Does 2/7 look right?" A chorus of "NO!" The visual disproof was the most powerful moment of the entire half-term.

**Tuesday (L17: Fractions greater than 1)** — When the sum exceeds 1, we need to convert to a mixed number. 4/5 + 3/5 = 7/5 = 1 2/5. Children used number lines to verify: 7/5 is between 1 and 2, closer to 1. That matches 1 2/5. Check.

Extended: 2/3 + 5/6. LCM of 3 and 6 is 6. 2/3 = 4/6. 4/6 + 5/6 = 9/6 = 1 3/6 = 1 1/2. Three steps: convert, add, simplify. Children are linking C008 (operations), C009 (mixed numbers), and C005 (factors for simplifying). The domains are weaving together exactly as I planned.

**Wednesday (L18: Multiplying fractions by whole numbers)** — "What is 3 × 2/5?" Repeated addition first: 2/5 + 2/5 + 2/5 = 6/5 = 1 1/5. Then the shortcut: multiply the numerator by the whole number, keep the denominator. 3 × 2/5 = 6/5 = 1 1/5.

Bar model: a bar split into fifths, shade 2/5. Repeat three times. How much altogether? Visual confirms the calculation.

Mixed numbers: 2 × 1 3/4. Convert to improper first: 1 3/4 = 7/4. Then 2 × 7/4 = 14/4 = 3 2/4 = 3 1/2. Or reason: 2 × 1 = 2, 2 × 3/4 = 6/4 = 1 2/4 = 1 1/2, total = 3 1/2. Both methods work — I showed both and let children choose.

**Thursday (L19: Fraction problem-solving)** — Multi-step word problems. This is where the depth of understanding shows.

"A recipe uses 2/3 cup of flour and 1/4 cup of sugar. How much more flour than sugar?" → 2/3 - 1/4 = 8/12 - 3/12 = 5/12 cup.

"Priya reads 3/8 of a book on Monday and 1/4 on Tuesday. What fraction has she read? What fraction is left?" → 3/8 + 2/8 = 5/8 read. 1 - 5/8 = 3/8 left.

Bar models for every problem. Children are becoming fluent with choosing the model first, then calculating. The stronger children are starting to reason about whether an answer is reasonable before calculating.

**Friday (L20: Mid-unit check)** — 20-question assessment covering C008 and C009:
- 4 questions on equivalent fractions
- 4 on adding/subtracting with same denominator
- 4 on adding/subtracting with different denominators
- 4 on mixed number/improper fraction conversion
- 4 on multiplying fractions by whole numbers

Results:
- Secure (16+/20): 18 children
- Developing (11-15/20): 8 children (mostly errors with LCM, or forgetting to simplify)
- Emerging (below 11): 4 children (still adding numerators and denominators — the 2/7 error persists)

The 4 emerging children will get targeted intervention in morning maths sessions. I cannot move to decimals with them still making the fundamental error. I'll use fraction bars daily with this group while the rest of the class moves on.

### Week 5: Decimals — Thousandths and the Bridge (D004-CL001 continued)

**Monday (L21: Thousandths — extending place value)** — Big reveal: extending the place value chart. "You know tenths and hundredths from Year 4. But what's ten times SMALLER than a hundredth?" Thousandths.

Place value chart with columns: ones | . | tenths | hundredths | thousandths. Modelled with metre sticks: 1 m = 1 whole; 0.1 m = 1 dm; 0.01 m = 1 cm; 0.001 m = 1 mm. Children measured objects to the nearest millimetre and wrote the measurement as a decimal of a metre. A pencil: 0.174 m = 174 mm.

Connected to division: 3 ÷ 1000 = 0.003. "We're dividing by 10 each time we move right in the place value chart."

**Tuesday (L22: Ordering and comparing decimals to 3 dp)** — Column comparison method: write numbers so decimal points align, compare digit by digit from left.

The predicted misconception appeared: "0.35 is bigger than 0.4 because 35 is bigger than 4." I wrote them column-aligned: 0.400 and 0.350. "Look at the tenths column. 4 tenths versus 3 tenths. Which is bigger?" 4 tenths. "So 0.4 is bigger, even though 35 looks like a bigger number. The PLACE VALUE matters, not the digits alone."

Sorting activity: children ordered sets of 5-6 decimals (e.g., 0.3, 0.305, 0.35, 0.299, 0.4). Working in pairs, explaining their reasoning to each other. Powerful discussions emerged.

**Wednesday (L23: Rounding decimals)** — Rounding to the nearest whole number: look at the tenths digit. 3.7 → 4. 3.4 → 3. 3.5 → 4 (round up on 5).

Rounding to one decimal place: look at the hundredths digit. 3.74 → 3.7. 3.76 → 3.8. 3.75 → 3.8.

Used number lines to show WHERE the decimal sits between the two rounding boundaries. 3.74 is between 3.7 and 3.8, closer to 3.7. Visual reasoning, not just rules.

**Thursday (L24: Decimals as fractions — THE BRIDGE)** — This is the lesson I've been building toward since Week 1. "0.71 = 71/100." The place value chart shows it: 7 tenths and 1 hundredth = 71 hundredths = 71/100.

Built the triple representation wall display:
- 0.5 = 5/10 = 1/2
- 0.25 = 25/100 = 1/4
- 0.75 = 75/100 = 3/4
- 0.1 = 1/10
- 0.01 = 1/100
- 0.001 = 1/1000

Children added entries as they discovered them. Connected to simplifying: 0.5 = 5/10 = 1/2 (divide both by 5 — using factors from Week 1!). The curriculum is spiralling beautifully.

**Friday (L25: Percentages — the third piece of the puzzle)** — "Per cent means 'per hundred.' 45% = 45 out of 100 = 45/100 = 0.45."

Hundredths grid: shade 45 squares out of 100. That's 45%. It's also 45/100. It's also 0.45. Three names for the same amount.

Key benchmark equivalences: 50% = 1/2 = 0.5. 25% = 1/4 = 0.25. 10% = 1/10 = 0.1. 1% = 1/100 = 0.01.

The 5% = 0.5 misconception appeared as predicted. I had children physically convert: "5% means 5 out of 100. 5/100. As a decimal? 5 hundredths = 0.05." The place value understanding from earlier this week provides the correction.

### Week 6: Percentages and the Grand Connection (D004-CL002)

**Monday (L26: Benchmark percentages)** — Building the full benchmark set:
- 50% = 1/2 = 0.5 (halving)
- 25% = 1/4 = 0.25 (halving twice)
- 75% = 3/4 = 0.75 (three quarters)
- 10% = 1/10 = 0.1 (dividing by 10)
- 20% = 1/5 = 0.2 (dividing by 5)
- 5% = 1/20 = 0.05 (half of 10%)
- 1% = 1/100 = 0.01 (dividing by 100)

Matching game: fraction cards, decimal cards, percentage cards spread on tables. Children match them into triples. Fast finishers create their own triples for others to check.

**Tuesday (L27: Converting between all three forms)** — Systematic conversion methods:
- Fraction → decimal: divide numerator by denominator (using short division from Week 2!)
- Decimal → percentage: multiply by 100
- Percentage → fraction: write over 100, simplify (using HCF from Week 1!)
- Fraction → percentage: via decimal, or via equivalent fraction with denominator 100

The entire half-term's learning converges in this lesson. Short division, HCF, equivalent fractions, decimal place value — all serving the conversion process. I explicitly narrated the connections: "Remember when you learned HCF in Week 1? This is why. Remember short division in Week 2? This is why."

Several children had genuine lightbulb moments. One said: "Miss, is THIS why we learned all that stuff about factors?" YES.

**Wednesday (L28: Finding percentages of quantities)** — Building from benchmarks:
- 50% of 80 = 40 (halve)
- 10% of 80 = 8 (divide by 10)
- 5% of 80 = 4 (half of 10%)
- 1% of 80 = 0.8 (divide by 100)
- 15% of 80 = 10% + 5% = 8 + 4 = 12
- 35% of 80 = 3 × 10% + 5% = 24 + 4 = 28

This building-block approach means children don't need to multiply by decimal percentages yet — they construct any percentage from 10%, 5%, and 1%. It's more conceptual than procedural.

Bar model approach for word problems: "A shirt costs £60. There is a 25% discount. What is the sale price?" Bar = £60. 25% = 1/4. Quarter of £60 = £15. Sale price = £60 - £15 = £45.

**Thursday (L29: The grand connection — problem-solving with all three forms)** — Rich problems requiring children to choose the most efficient representation:

"Which is larger: 3/8 or 40%?" Convert to same form: 3/8 = 0.375 = 37.5%. Since 37.5% < 40%, 40% is larger.

"A jar is 0.6 full. What fraction is empty?" 0.6 = 6/10 = 3/5 full. Empty = 1 - 3/5 = 2/5 = 0.4 = 40%.

Gallery walk: problems displayed around the room, children circulate in pairs, solving and discussing.

**Friday (L30: End-of-unit assessment)** — Comprehensive assessment covering both domains:
- Section A (10 marks): Number properties and formal methods (D003)
- Section B (15 marks): Fractions operations (D004 — C008, C009)
- Section C (15 marks): Decimals and percentages (D004 — C010, C013)
- Section D (10 marks): Problem-solving requiring connections across domains

Total: 50 marks.

## End-of-Unit Reflections

### What worked

1. **Teaching factors/LCM before fractions was essential** — the children who were secure with LCM found common denominators straightforward. The D003→D004 prerequisite link in the graph is the most important structural insight.

2. **The "visual disproof" of 1/3 + 1/4 = 2/7** was the turning point of the half-term. Once children could SEE that the answer was wrong, they were motivated to learn the right method.

3. **Building the triple representation wall** over Weeks 5-6 made the fraction-decimal-percentage connection tangible and cumulative. Children added to it daily and referred to it constantly.

4. **Interpreting division remainders as fractions** (L9) was a bridge the graph should have flagged. That single lesson connected D003 to D004 more effectively than any co-teaching signal.

5. **The CPA progression for every concept** meant that even the less confident children had a visual or concrete anchor. Nobody was left with just an algorithm.

### What I'd change

1. **More time on decimal ordering** — L22 needed a second day. The misconception about "longer decimals are bigger" is deeply held and one lesson wasn't enough for all children.

2. **Less time on long multiplication** — two lessons was actually generous. Most children transferred from the grid method quickly. I could have used one of those lessons for decimal practice.

3. **The D004 cluster structure needs rethinking** — two clusters for four concepts spanning 6 weeks of teaching is not enough scaffolding. I effectively created my own sub-clusters: fractions operations (Weeks 3-4), decimals (Week 5), percentages (Week 6). The algorithm should produce something closer to this.

4. **I wish the graph had a co-teaching signal between C007 (short division) and C009 (mixed numbers)** — the remainder-as-fraction connection is one of the most powerful bridges in Year 5 maths and it's not flagged.

5. **Assessment timing** — the algorithm puts a D003 assessment cluster at the end of D003 (8 lessons!). I compressed this to one lesson (L10) and inserted a mid-unit fractions check (L20) that doesn't appear in the cluster structure at all. Real teaching needs more frequent, lighter-touch assessment, not fewer heavy blocks.

### Final thought

Nine concepts in thirty lessons felt like a luxury at the start, and by the end it was exactly right. Every concept got the depth it deserved. The children who arrived in September thinking fractions, decimals and percentages were three different things left for half-term knowing they're three faces of the same number. That's the transformation this half-term delivers, and the graph — with all its imperfections — gave me a scaffold to build it on.

The cluster sequence got the big picture right (D003 foundations first, D004 builds on them). Where it fell short was in the fine-grained sequencing within D004 and in surfacing the cross-domain co-teaching opportunities that make mathematics beautiful. That's what teachers do — we take the structure and fill it with meaning.
