## Week 1: Welcome to Biology — The Cell

### Lesson 1: What are living things made of?

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | SC-KS3-C026 (Cell structure — introduction) |
| **Cluster ref** | SC-KS3-D002-CL001 (modified — resequenced to teach microscopy early) |
| **Objective** | Describe what cells are and identify the basic structures of an animal cell |
| **WS skills** | Scientific questioning (C007) — "What do you think cells look like?" |
| **Key vocabulary** | cell, nucleus, cytoplasm, cell membrane, organelle, unicellular, multicellular |
| **Practical?** | No — visual/discursive lesson |

**Structure (60 min):**
- (10 min) Starter: "How small can you see?" — show images at increasing magnification, from hand → skin → tissue → cell. Introduce the idea that all living things are made of cells.
- (5 min) Key question: How many cells are in your body? (approx. 37 trillion). Brief history — Robert Hooke's cork cells (1665).
- (20 min) Direct instruction: animal cell diagram — nucleus, cytoplasm, cell membrane. Pupils annotate their own diagram with labels and simple descriptions. Use the "cell is like a room" analogy: membrane = walls, nucleus = filing cabinet, cytoplasm = air/space where things happen.
- (15 min) Task: pupils draw and label an animal cell from memory. Peer check against the original.
- (5 min) Exit ticket: "Name three parts of an animal cell and state one function."
- (5 min) Preview: "Tomorrow we'll learn what each part actually does."

**Differentiation:**
- Support: pre-printed diagram with labels to match rather than draw from scratch
- Stretch: introduce the term "organelle"; ask why cells need a membrane (link to later diffusion work)

### Lesson 2: Inside the cell — organelles and their jobs

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | SC-KS3-C026 (Cell structure), SC-KS3-C028 (Cell organelle functions) |
| **Cluster ref** | SC-KS3-D002-CL001 |
| **Objective** | Describe the functions of the nucleus, mitochondria, cell membrane, cytoplasm, chloroplasts, vacuole, and cell wall |
| **WS skills** | — |
| **Key vocabulary** | nucleus, DNA, mitochondria, respiration, cell membrane, selectively permeable, cytoplasm, chloroplast, photosynthesis, vacuole, cell wall, cellulose, ribosome |
| **Practical?** | No — card sort activity |

**Structure (60 min):**
- (10 min) Retrieval starter: quick-fire whiteboard quiz on L1 content — "Draw and label an animal cell from memory" (2 min), then check.
- (20 min) Direct instruction: go through each organelle with its function. Nucleus = contains DNA, controls the cell. Mitochondria = site of respiration, releases energy. Cell membrane = controls what enters/leaves. Cytoplasm = jelly-like substance where reactions happen. Address misconception: the nucleus is NOT a "brain" — it contains instructions (DNA) but doesn't think.
- (5 min) Introduce plant-only organelles: chloroplast (photosynthesis), large permanent vacuole (stores cell sap), cell wall (support, made of cellulose). Note: not all plant cells have chloroplasts — root cells don't.
- (15 min) Card sort activity: match organelle name → function → location (plant only / animal only / both). Pupils work in pairs.
- (5 min) Class check: go through answers, address common errors.
- (5 min) Exit ticket: "Which organelle releases energy? Which organelle is found in plant cells but not animal cells?"

**Differentiation:**
- Support: reduced card sort with 5 organelles (not 7); function descriptions in simplified language
- Stretch: include ribosomes; ask "Why do muscle cells have more mitochondria than skin cells?"

### Lesson 3: Using the microscope

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | SC-KS3-C027 (Light microscopy) |
| **Cluster ref** | SC-KS3-D002-CL001 (moved from CL012 — see teaching log) |

| **Key vocabulary** | light microscope, eyepiece lens, objective lens, stage, focus, magnification, resolution, prepared slide, field of view, micrometre |
| **Practical?** | Yes — CORE PRACTICAL (microscopy skills) |

**Structure (60 min):**
- (5 min) Starter: show a microscope image — "What do you think this is?" Reveal answer. "Today you'll learn to use the instrument that lets us see this."
- (10 min) Demo: how to carry a microscope, identify parts (eyepiece, objective lenses, stage, coarse/fine focus, light source), place a slide, start on lowest magnification, focus. Safety: don't touch lenses with fingers, report breakages immediately.
- (5 min) Risk assessment: pupils complete a quick risk assessment (hazard: glass slides; precaution: handle carefully, report breakages).
- (30 min) Practical: pupils set up microscopes and view prepared slides (letter 'e', fabric fibres, insect leg). Progress through x4, x10, x40 magnification. Record what they see by drawing in their books. Circulate and troubleshoot.
- (5 min) Introduce magnification: total magnification = eyepiece × objective. Calculate for each setting they used.
- (5 min) Exit ticket: "What is the total magnification if the eyepiece is x10 and the objective lens is x40?"

**Differentiation:**
- Support: laminated microscope diagram at each bench with parts labelled; TA support for focusing
- Stretch: calculate the actual size of an object seen under the microscope using magnification = image size ÷ actual size

## Week 2: Seeing Cells and Comparing Them

### Lesson 4: Observing real cells under the microscope

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | SC-KS3-C027 (Light microscopy), SC-KS3-C026 (Cell structure — application) |
| **Cluster ref** | SC-KS3-D002-CL001 |
| **Objective** | Prepare and stain slides of plant and animal cells; produce labelled scientific drawings |
| **WS skills** | Laboratory techniques (C011), Scientific measurement (C012), Data presentation (C016 — scientific drawing), Accuracy & precision (C002 — measuring with microscope) |
| **Key vocabulary** | slide, cover slip, stain, iodine, methylene blue, onion epidermal cell, cheek cell, scientific drawing, scale bar, magnification |
| **Practical?** | Yes — CORE PRACTICAL (cell observation) |

**Structure (60 min):**
- (5 min) Retrieval starter: "Name three parts of a microscope and explain what each does."
- (10 min) Demo: how to prepare a wet mount slide. Onion epidermis: peel thin layer, place on slide, add drop of iodine stain, lower cover slip at 45° to avoid air bubbles. Cheek cells: gently scrape inside of cheek with cotton bud, smear on slide, add methylene blue, cover slip.
- (5 min) Scientific drawing rules: use a sharp pencil, draw what you actually see (not what you think you should see), no shading, label lines with a ruler, include title and magnification.
- (30 min) Practical: pupils prepare and observe both cell types. Draw labelled scientific diagrams of each. Identify visible organelles (cell wall, nucleus, cytoplasm in onion cells; nucleus, cell membrane, cytoplasm in cheek cells).
- (5 min) Compare: "What could you see in the plant cell that you couldn't see in the animal cell?" (cell wall, possibly vacuole and chloroplasts in other plant cells)
- (5 min) Exit ticket: "Draw a labelled onion cell from memory. Include a scale bar."

**Differentiation:**
- Support: pre-drawn outline of what they should see, with labels to add; focus on one cell type if time is short
- Stretch: calculate the actual size of one cell using the magnification formula; compare their drawings with textbook diagrams — why do real cells look different from diagrams?

### Lesson 5: Organelle functions in depth

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | SC-KS3-C028 (Cell organelle functions — consolidation) |
| **Cluster ref** | SC-KS3-D002-CL001 |
| **Objective** | Explain the function of each organelle and relate organelle function to cell type |
| **WS skills** | — |
| **Key vocabulary** | organelle, nucleus, DNA, mitochondria, aerobic respiration, chloroplast, photosynthesis, ribosome, protein synthesis, selectively permeable, cell sap |
| **Practical?** | No — consolidation and application |

**Structure (60 min):**
- (10 min) Retrieval starter: 10-question mini-whiteboard quiz on organelle names and functions. "Show me the organelle that... releases energy / contains DNA / makes proteins / is only in plant cells."
- (15 min) Deepening: why do different cells have different numbers of organelles? Muscle cells: lots of mitochondria (need energy for contraction). Leaf cells: lots of chloroplasts (photosynthesis). Root cells: no chloroplasts (no light underground). Sperm cells: many mitochondria in the midpiece (energy for swimming). This introduces the idea of specialisation (sets up hierarchy in L10).
- (15 min) Application task: pupils given descriptions of 5 mystery cells and must identify each based on its organelle profile. "This cell has many chloroplasts, a large vacuole, and a cell wall. What type of cell is it?"
- (10 min) Connect to microscopy: "When you looked at the onion cells, which organelles could you actually see? Why couldn't you see mitochondria?" (Too small for a light microscope — introduce idea of resolution vs magnification.)
- (5 min) Peer teach: explain one organelle's function to your partner in 60 seconds without using notes.
- (5 min) Exit ticket: "Why do root cells have no chloroplasts?"

**Differentiation:**
- Support: organelle function reference card available; mystery cells have simpler descriptions
- Stretch: research electron microscopy — what can it show that light microscopy can't?

---

### Lesson 6: Plant vs animal cells

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | SC-KS3-C029 (Plant vs animal cells) |
| **Cluster ref** | SC-KS3-D002-CL001 |
| **Objective** | Compare and contrast the structures of plant and animal cells; explain why the differences exist |
| **WS skills** | Accuracy (C002 — careful observation and recording) |
| **Key vocabulary** | plant cell, animal cell, cell wall, cellulose, chloroplast, permanent vacuole, cell membrane, comparison, structural difference, functional difference |
| **Practical?** | Yes — supporting practical (microscope comparison, brief) |

**Structure (60 min):**
- (5 min) Retrieval starter: "Draw a plant cell from memory. Now draw an animal cell. What's different?"
- (10 min) Direct instruction: systematic comparison. What plant cells have that animal cells don't: cell wall (support), chloroplasts (photosynthesis), large permanent vacuole (stores cell sap, maintains turgor). What both have: nucleus, cytoplasm, cell membrane, mitochondria, ribosomes. Address misconception: plant cells DO have mitochondria — they respire all the time, but only photosynthesise in light.
- (15 min) Venn diagram activity: pupils complete a large Venn diagram sorting organelles and features into "plant only," "animal only," and "both." Include structural and functional features.
- (15 min) Quick practical: look at pre-prepared slides of plant cells (e.g., Elodea leaf) and animal cells (cheek cells or blood cells). Can they identify which is which based on visible features? Draw a quick comparison diagram.
- (10 min) Extended thinking: "Bacteria don't have a nucleus. How is a bacterial cell different from a plant or animal cell?" Introduce the idea of prokaryotes briefly.
- (5 min) Exit ticket: "Give two differences between plant and animal cells and explain why plants need a cell wall."

**Differentiation:**
- Support: partially completed Venn diagram with some features pre-placed
- Stretch: compare plant, animal, and bacterial cells in a three-way table; explain why animal cells don't have cell walls (flexibility needed for movement and shape change)

## Week 3: How Substances Move + Unicellular Life

### Lesson 7: Diffusion — the movement of particles

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | SC-KS3-C030 (Diffusion — introduction) |
| **Cluster ref** | SC-KS3-D002-CL003 (modified — diffusion only, rest resequenced) |
| **Objective** | Define diffusion and explain it using the particle model; describe the net movement from high to low concentration |
| **WS skills** | Scientific prediction (C008 — "I predict... because..."), Variables in experiments (C009 — what affects diffusion rate?) |
| **Key vocabulary** | diffusion, concentration, concentration gradient, net movement, random motion, particle, equilibrium, high concentration, low concentration, passive transport |
| **Practical?** | Yes — teacher demo + pupil observation (potassium permanganate in water) |

**Structure (60 min):**
- (5 min) Starter: spray air freshener (or wave a scented item) at the front of the room. "Put your hand up when you can smell it." Time how long it takes to reach the back. Why?
- (10 min) Direct instruction: define diffusion — the net movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. Use particle diagrams. "Crowded room" analogy: if one side of the room is packed and the other is empty, people naturally spread out.
- (15 min) Demo: drop a potassium permanganate crystal into a beaker of cold still water. Pupils predict what will happen and why. Observe over 10 minutes (continue during next task). Record observations at 0, 2, 5, 10 minutes. Optional: set up a second beaker with warm water — "Will it be faster or slower? Why?"
- (15 min) Particle model explanation: draw particle diagrams showing random movement. The key insight: individual particles move randomly, but the NET movement is from high to low concentration. This is passive — no energy from the cell is required.
- (10 min) Biological context: "Where does diffusion happen in your body?" Oxygen from lungs into blood. Nutrients from small intestine into blood. Carbon dioxide from blood into lungs. "We'll explore these in detail later this year."
- (5 min) Exit ticket: "Define diffusion. Explain why a tea bag colours water even if you don't stir it."

**Differentiation:**
- Support: pre-drawn particle diagrams to annotate with arrows showing net movement
- Stretch: "What three factors might affect the rate of diffusion?" (temperature, concentration gradient, surface area) — link to the warm/cold water comparison

### Lesson 8: Diffusion in living things

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | SC-KS3-C030 (Diffusion — application) |

| **Key vocabulary** | surface area, concentration gradient, cell membrane, oxygen, carbon dioxide, absorption, villi, alveoli, net movement |
| **Practical?** | Yes — agar jelly cube investigation (supporting practical) |

**Structure (60 min):**
- (5 min) Retrieval starter: "What is diffusion? Draw a before and after particle diagram showing diffusion."
- (10 min) Review the potassium permanganate demo from yesterday: what happened in the cold water vs warm water? Why? (Particles move faster at higher temperatures → faster diffusion)
- (20 min) Practical: agar jelly cubes with indicator (phenolphthalein or universal indicator) in dilute acid or alkali. Cut cubes to 3 different sizes (e.g., 1cm, 2cm, 3cm sides). Time how long for the indicator to change colour throughout each cube. Record results in a table. "Why does the small cube change fastest?" (Higher surface area to volume ratio.)
- (15 min) Discussion and data: compare results across groups (repeatability). Identify the pattern (smaller cube = faster colour change). Draw a bar chart of results. Connect to biology: "This is why cells are small — they need to exchange substances efficiently."
- (5 min) Look ahead: "Diffusion is how oxygen gets into your blood, how nutrients are absorbed from food, and how plants take in carbon dioxide. We'll keep coming back to this idea."
- (5 min) Exit ticket: "Explain why cells are small, using the word 'diffusion' in your answer."

**Differentiation:**
- Support: results table pre-drawn with column headings; focus on describing the pattern rather than explaining it
- Stretch: calculate the surface area to volume ratio for each cube size; predict what would happen with a 0.5cm cube

### Lesson 9: Unicellular organisms — one cell does everything

| | |
|---|---|

| **Practical?** | Yes — supporting practical (pond water observation if available; otherwise video microscopy + prepared slides) |

**Structure (60 min):**
- (5 min) Starter: "You are made of 37 trillion cells. Some organisms are made of just ONE cell. How does that work?"
- (15 min) Direct instruction: introduce three unicellular organisms.
  - *Amoeba*: moves by extending pseudopodia, engulfs food (phagocytosis), reproduces by binary fission.
  - *Euglena*: has a flagellum for movement AND chloroplasts for photosynthesis — is it a plant or an animal? (Neither — it's a protist.)
  - *Paramecium*: covered in cilia for movement, has an oral groove for feeding, contractile vacuole pumps out excess water.
- (20 min) Practical/observation: if pond water is available, pupils observe living organisms under the microscope and try to identify what they see. If not, use video microscopy clips and prepared slides. Pupils draw and label at least one unicellular organism.
- (10 min) Comparison activity: how does each organism carry out the seven life processes (movement, respiration, sensitivity, growth, reproduction, excretion, nutrition) using just one cell? Complete a table.
- (5 min) Bridge to next lesson: "These organisms do everything with one cell. But you have 37 trillion specialised cells organised into tissues, organs, and systems. Tomorrow we'll explore how that works."
- (5 min) Exit ticket: "Name one unicellular organism and describe one adaptation that helps it survive."

**Differentiation:**
- Support: provide a completed example row in the life processes table; focus on Amoeba as the main example
- Stretch: research yeast as a unicellular fungus — how does it reproduce? What is its economic importance?

| **Practical?** | No — modelling activity |

**Structure (60 min):**
- (5 min) Retrieval starter: "What are the differences between plant and animal cells? What is diffusion?"
- (15 min) Direct instruction: build the hierarchy. Cell → Tissue (group of similar cells working together) → Organ (different tissues working together) → Organ system (organs working together) → Organism. Use the digestive system as the running example: epithelial cells → epithelial tissue → stomach → digestive system → human. Define specialisation: cells become different shapes and structures to do particular jobs.
- (15 min) Examples at each level: muscle tissue, nervous tissue, connective tissue (in organs like the stomach). Organ examples: heart, lungs, stomach, brain. Organ system examples: digestive, circulatory, respiratory, nervous, skeletal.
- (15 min) Activity: pupils create a foldable or stacked diagram showing the hierarchy, with their own examples at each level. Must include at least one example not given in class.
- (5 min) Address misconception: "A tissue is NOT the same as a Kleenex tissue! In biology, a tissue is a group of similar cells working together to perform a function."
- (5 min) Exit ticket: "Put these in order from smallest to largest: organ, cell, organ system, tissue, organism."

**Differentiation:**
- Support: provide a pre-structured foldable template with the hierarchy levels labelled
- Stretch: "Is the blood a tissue, an organ, or an organ system? Justify your answer." (It's a connective tissue — interesting edge case)

  - Section A (10 marks): Multiple choice — 10 questions covering key facts and common misconceptions
  - Section B (12 marks): Short answer — label a cell diagram, calculate magnification, define diffusion, give examples of hierarchy levels
  - Section C (8 marks): Extended writing — "Explain why plant cells need both chloroplasts AND mitochondria." OR "A student says 'all cells look the same.' Explain why this is wrong, using examples."
- (15 min) Self-assessment: pupils mark their own Section A using the answers on the board. Identify three things they got right and one area to improve.
- (10 min) Gap identification: class discussion of the most common errors. Quick re-teach of any widely misunderstood concepts.
- (5 min) Bridge: "Next lesson we're starting a new topic — nutrition. What does your body need from food?"

---

### Lesson 12: Balanced diet — what your body needs

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | SC-KS3-C036 (Balanced diet components) |

| **Practical?** | No — food label analysis activity |

**Structure (60 min):**
- (5 min) Starter: "Write down everything you ate yesterday. We'll come back to this."
- (15 min) Direct instruction: the seven components of a balanced diet — carbohydrates (energy), proteins (growth and repair), lipids/fats (energy store, insulation, cell membranes), vitamins (A, C, D — small amounts for specific functions), minerals (iron for haemoglobin, calcium for bones), fibre (digestive health), water (every chemical reaction).
- (15 min) Food label activity: pupils examine real food labels (or photocopied ones). Identify which nutrients are present and in what quantities. Which food has the most protein? The most fat? The most fibre?
- (10 min) Application: go back to yesterday's diet. Which nutrient groups were well-represented? Which might have been missing? This is NOT about judging diet but about understanding balance. Handle sensitively — some pupils may have food insecurity.
- (10 min) Quick discussion: "Why does a balanced diet NOT mean equal amounts of everything?" Different nutrients are needed in different amounts. Age, sex, and activity level all affect requirements.
- (5 min) Exit ticket: "Name four nutrients your body needs and explain why you need one of them."

**Differentiation:**
- Support: provide a nutrients reference card with name, function, and food source for each
- Stretch: research a specific vitamin deficiency (scurvy, rickets, night blindness) and explain the biological mechanism

| **Practical?** | Yes — CORE PRACTICAL (food tests) |

**Structure (60 min):**
- (5 min) Starter: "How could a scientist work out what nutrients are in a food, without reading the label?"
- (10 min) Demo + instruction: demonstrate each food test with a known positive and negative control.
  - Iodine: yellow-brown → blue-black = starch present
  - Benedict's: blue → green/yellow/orange/brick red = reducing sugar present (needs heating in water bath)
  - Biuret: blue → purple/lilac = protein present
  - Ethanol emulsion: clear → cloudy white = fat/lipid present
- (5 min) Risk assessment: identify hazards (Bunsen burner for Benedict's test, iodine stains, Biuret reagent contains sodium hydroxide). Precautions: goggles, tie hair back, report spills.
- (30 min) Practical: pupils test 4-5 unknown foods (e.g., bread, egg white, milk, butter/oil, apple) with all four tests. Record results in a table. Predict before testing: "I predict bread will test positive for starch because..."
- (5 min) Class results: compare. Any surprises? (Milk contains sugar, protein, AND fat.)
- (5 min) Exit ticket: "You test an unknown food with iodine and it turns blue-black. What nutrient does it contain?"

**Differentiation:**

### Lesson 14: Energy requirements — counting kilojoules

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | SC-KS3-C037 (Energy requirements calculation) |

| **Key vocabulary** | energy, kilojoule, kilocalorie, food label, daily intake, energy requirement, basal metabolic rate, physical activity, energy balance |
| **Practical?** | No — data analysis lesson |

**Structure (60 min):**
- (5 min) Retrieval starter: "Name three nutrients that provide energy."
- (10 min) Direct instruction: energy is measured in kilojoules (kJ) or kilocalories (kcal). Food labels show energy per 100g and per serving. Average daily requirements: ~8,400 kJ for an adult. Varies by age, sex, activity level. Explain energy balance: energy in (food) vs energy out (activity + BMR).
- (20 min) Calculation activity: pupils are given food label data for a full day of meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks). Calculate total energy intake. Compare with recommended daily intake for their age group. Pupils who finish early: calculate percentage of daily energy from each meal.
- (10 min) Analysis: "Which meal had the most energy? Does this person's diet meet their daily needs? What if this person was a professional athlete — would the diet be enough?" Discuss how activity level changes requirements.
- (10 min) Data presentation: draw a bar chart showing energy from each meal vs recommended intake.
- (5 min) Exit ticket: "A food label says 150 kJ per 100g. You eat 200g. How much energy is that?"

**Differentiation:**
- Support: calculation frame provided (step-by-step method); simpler numbers; calculator allowed

### Lesson 15: Diet imbalances — what goes wrong

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | SC-KS3-C038 (Diet imbalances) |

| **Practical?** | No — data analysis and case study lesson |

**Structure (60 min):**
- (5 min) Retrieval starter: "What are the seven components of a balanced diet?"
- (10 min) Direct instruction: define malnutrition (any dietary imbalance — NOT just "not eating enough"). Cover three categories:
  - Overconsumption: obesity → type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, joint problems
  - Underconsumption: starvation → muscle wasting, organ failure
  - Specific deficiencies: scurvy (vitamin C), rickets (vitamin D/calcium), anaemia (iron)
- (5 min) Address misconception: "An obese person can be malnourished — they may eat too much energy but lack essential vitamins and minerals."
- (15 min) Case studies: pupils analyse three case studies (different ages, lifestyles, diets) and identify what's wrong with each diet and what health consequences might follow. Answer structured questions.
- (15 min) Data analysis: UK childhood obesity statistics over the past 20 years. Pupils interpret a line graph, identify trends, and suggest possible explanations. "Correlation does not mean causation — what other factors might be involved?"
- (5 min) Sensitive discussion: emphasise that diet is influenced by many factors including income, access, culture, and medical conditions. This is science, not judgement.
- (5 min) Exit ticket: "Name one deficiency disease and explain what causes it."

**Differentiation:**

## Week 6: Digestion

### Lesson 16: The digestive system — the journey of food

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | SC-KS3-C039 (Digestive system) |
| **Cluster ref** | SC-KS3-D002-CL006 |
| **Objective** | Identify the organs of the digestive system; describe the function of each; distinguish mechanical from chemical digestion |
| **WS skills** | — |
| **Key vocabulary** | mouth, teeth, salivary gland, oesophagus, peristalsis, stomach, acid, small intestine, large intestine, liver, pancreas, bile, mechanical digestion, chemical digestion, absorption, villi, egestion |
| **Practical?** | No — torso model + diagram work |

**Structure (60 min):**
- (5 min) Starter: "You eat a cheese sandwich at 12:30. Trace its journey through your body. What happens to it?"
- (20 min) Direct instruction: trace food through the digestive system. At each organ, identify:
  - What happens (mechanical and/or chemical digestion?)
  - Mouth: teeth mechanically break food; salivary amylase begins starch digestion
  - Oesophagus: peristalsis pushes food down (NOT gravity — you can eat upside down)
  - Stomach: acid kills bacteria + protease enzymes break down protein; churning = mechanical digestion
  - Small intestine: pancreatic enzymes complete digestion; bile from liver emulsifies fats; absorption through villi into blood (link to diffusion!)
  - Large intestine: absorbs water
  - Rectum/anus: egestion of waste
  Use torso model to show each organ's position.
- (15 min) Labelling activity: pupils label a blank digestive system diagram and write one function next to each organ.
- (10 min) Key distinction: mechanical digestion (physical — teeth, churning) vs chemical digestion (enzymes breaking bonds). "Which type makes food particles smaller? Both! But in different ways."
- (5 min) Link to hierarchy: "The digestive system is an organ system. The stomach is an organ. The stomach contains different tissues. This is the hierarchy we learned in Lesson 10."
- (5 min) Exit ticket: "Name three organs in the digestive system and state one function of each."

**Differentiation:**
- Support: partially labelled diagram; word bank for functions
- Stretch: explain why the small intestine is so long (approx. 6m) and has villi — link to surface area and diffusion rate

### Lesson 17: Enzymes — biological catalysts

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | SC-KS3-C040 (Enzymes as catalysts) |
| **Cluster ref** | SC-KS3-D002-CL006 |
| **Objective** | Explain what enzymes are and how they work using the lock-and-key model; name the three main digestive enzymes |
| **WS skills** | — |
| **Key vocabulary** | enzyme, biological catalyst, active site, substrate, product, lock-and-key model, specificity, amylase, protease, lipase, denaturation, optimum temperature |
| **Practical?** | No — model-building lesson (preparation for L18 practical) |

**Structure (60 min):**
- (5 min) Retrieval starter: "What is chemical digestion? Name an organ where chemical digestion happens."
- (15 min) Direct instruction: what is an enzyme? A biological catalyst — a protein that speeds up chemical reactions without being used up. Three key digestive enzymes:
  - Amylase: starch → sugars (mouth + small intestine)
  - Protease: proteins → amino acids (stomach + small intestine)
  - Lipase: fats → fatty acids + glycerol (small intestine)
- (10 min) Lock-and-key model: the enzyme has an active site with a specific shape. Only one substrate fits. When the substrate binds, the enzyme breaks it down. The enzyme is released unchanged and can be reused. Draw the model step by step. Pupils copy and annotate.
- (10 min) Address misconceptions: "Enzymes are NOT alive — they are molecules. They are NOT 'killed' by heat — they are 'denatured' (the active site changes shape permanently). Enzymes are specific — amylase ONLY works on starch, not protein."
- (10 min) Application: "Why does the stomach produce acid?" (Optimum pH for protease enzymes in the stomach is pH 2). "Why does bile make fats into smaller droplets?" (Increases surface area for lipase to work on — link to diffusion/surface area from L8).
- (5 min) Preview: "Tomorrow you'll investigate how temperature affects enzyme activity. You'll design your own experiment."
- (5 min) Exit ticket: "Draw the lock-and-key model. Label the enzyme, active site, substrate, and products."

**Differentiation:**
- Support: pre-drawn lock-and-key diagrams to annotate; simplified enzyme summary table (enzyme → substrate → product)
- Stretch: research what happens to enzymes at high temperatures at the molecular level (hydrogen bonds break → tertiary structure unfolds → active site shape changes)

### Lesson 18: Enzyme investigation — amylase practical

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | SC-KS3-C040 (Enzymes as catalysts — practical investigation) |
| **Cluster ref** | SC-KS3-D002-CL006 |
| **Objective** | Investigate the effect of temperature on the rate of starch breakdown by amylase; design a controlled experiment |
| **WS skills** | Experimental design (C010), Variables (C009), Scientific prediction (C008), Risk evaluation (C006), Data presentation (C016), Drawing conclusions (C018), Method reliability (C013) |
| **Key vocabulary** | independent variable, dependent variable, control variable, prediction, rate of reaction, iodine test, water bath, controlled experiment, anomalous result, conclusion |
| **Practical?** | Yes — CORE PRACTICAL (enzyme investigation — most WS-rich lesson of the half-term) |

**Structure (60 min):**
- (5 min) Starter: "We know enzymes break down food. Do they work the same at all temperatures?"
- (10 min) Planning phase:
  - Question: How does temperature affect the rate of starch breakdown by amylase?
  - Variables: Independent = temperature (e.g., 20°C, 30°C, 40°C, 50°C, 60°C). Dependent = time for starch to be completely broken down (tested with iodine — when it stops turning blue-black). Control = volume of amylase, concentration of starch, volume of starch.
  - Prediction: "I predict the enzyme will work fastest at around 37-40°C because that is body temperature. At higher temperatures the enzyme will denature."
  - Risk assessment: hot water, glass equipment, iodine stains.
- (5 min) Method recap: place spotting tile with drops of iodine. Mix amylase and starch in test tube in water bath. Every 30 seconds, take a sample and add to iodine. Record the time when iodine stays yellow-brown (starch fully broken down).
- (25 min) Practical: pupils carry out investigation in pairs. Record results in a table. High-attainers test 5 temperatures; others test 3-4.
- (10 min) Results and discussion: share results as a class. Draw a line graph of temperature vs time. Identify the pattern. Discuss: "What happened at 60°C? Why?" (Denaturation.) "Were your results repeatable? How could you improve the method?"
- (5 min) Exit ticket: "What is the independent variable in this experiment? What happened to the enzyme at high temperature and why?"

**Differentiation:**
- Support: step-by-step method provided; results table pre-drawn; focus on describing results rather than explaining
- Stretch: design a follow-up investigation (e.g., effect of pH on amylase activity); calculate rate of reaction (1 ÷ time)

## Week 7: Finishing the Story + Assessment

### Lesson 19: Gut bacteria and digestive health

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concept IDs** | SC-KS3-C041 (Gut bacteria) |
| **Cluster ref** | SC-KS3-D002-CL006 |
| **Objective** | Explain the role of bacteria in digestion; describe the gut microbiome and factors that affect it |
| **WS skills** | — |
| **Key vocabulary** | gut bacteria, microbiome, beneficial bacteria, fibre, fermentation, vitamin synthesis, pathogen, probiotic, prebiotic, symbiosis, mutualism |
| **Practical?** | No — discussion and research lesson |

**Structure (60 min):**
- (5 min) Starter: "How many bacteria live in your gut? a) thousands b) millions c) billions d) trillions." (Answer: trillions — roughly 38 trillion, about the same as the number of human cells in your body.)
- (15 min) Direct instruction: the gut microbiome. Bacteria in the large intestine:
  - Break down dietary fibre that human enzymes can't digest
  - Produce vitamins (vitamin K, B vitamins)
  - Protect against harmful pathogens by competing for space and resources
  - Train the immune system
  Most gut bacteria are beneficial — not all bacteria are "germs."
- (10 min) Factors affecting gut bacteria: diet (high-fibre foods promote beneficial bacteria), antibiotics (can disrupt gut flora — this is why you sometimes get stomach upset with antibiotics), probiotics (live beneficial bacteria in yoghurt) vs prebiotics (food for bacteria, like fibre). Address misconception: probiotics ≠ prebiotics.
- (15 min) Research activity: pupils research one aspect of the microbiome in more depth (gut-brain axis, fecal transplants, how baby gut bacteria develop, antibiotic resistance). Share findings with table group.
- (10 min) Connection to the unit: "How does this link to balanced diet? To the digestive system? To diffusion?" Pupils draw a concept map showing connections between this lesson and the rest of the half-term.
- (5 min) Exit ticket: "Give two ways gut bacteria help your body."

**Differentiation:**
- Support: structured concept map template with key terms pre-placed; focus on the three main roles of gut bacteria
- Stretch: evaluate the evidence for probiotic supplements — are they scientifically supported or mainly marketing?
