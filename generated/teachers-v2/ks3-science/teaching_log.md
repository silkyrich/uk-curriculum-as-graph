# Mr Davies' Planning Log — Y7 Biology, Autumn 1

**Half-term**: Autumn 1 (7 weeks, 21 lessons at 3 x 60 min/week)
**Domains**: Structure & Function of Living Organisms (SC-KS3-D002) + Working Scientifically (SC-KS3-D001)
**Graph context source**: `graph_context.md` (27 clusters, 49 concepts)

---

## First Impressions: 27 Clusters for 21 Lessons

Right. So the algorithm has given me 27 clusters across two domains — 13 for Working Scientifically and 14 for the Biology content — and I have 21 lessons. That's immediately a problem, but not the problem the numbers suggest. Let me explain.

Working Scientifically is *not a standalone teaching unit*. I don't spend a fortnight teaching kids how to draw a graph before they touch any biology. That would be mind-numbing, and they'd forget it all by the time they actually needed to use it. Working Scientifically is taught *through* the biology content — embedded in practicals, woven into data analysis, modelled during class discussion. The graph treats it as a separate domain with its own cluster sequence, but no secondary science teacher would teach it that way. The 13 Working Scientifically clusters (SC-KS3-D001-CL001 through CL013) are better understood as a skills curriculum that maps onto my biology lessons, not a parallel teaching sequence.

So really I'm working with 14 Biology clusters and 24 Working Scientifically concepts to embed. That's still more than 21 lessons can hold — the Biology domain alone has 25 concepts — but it's a solvable problem. Let me work through it.

---

## The Big Prioritisation Decision

The 25 Biology concepts span the *entire* KS3 Structure & Function strand: cells, organisation, skeleton and muscles, nutrition, digestion, gas exchange, breathing, reproduction (human and plant), and drugs. That's a full year's biology, not a half-term.

For Autumn 1 with Year 7, the realistic scope is:

**In scope (this half-term):**
1. **Cells** — structure, microscopy, organelles, plant vs animal, diffusion, unicellular organisms
2. **Organisation** — biological hierarchy (cells → tissues → organs → systems)
3. **Nutrition and Digestion** — balanced diet, energy requirements, diet imbalances, digestive system, enzymes, gut bacteria

**Deferred (Spring/Summer terms):**
- Skeletal structure, biomechanics, antagonistic muscles → Spring 1 (pairs well with Forces in physics)
- Gas exchange, breathing mechanism, impacts on gas exchange, stomata → Spring 2
- Human reproduction, placenta function → Summer 1 (needs PSHE coordination, RSE policy)
- Plant nutrition, plant reproduction → Summer 1-2 (pairs with photosynthesis)
- Drug effects → Summer 2 (needs PSHE coordination)

This means I'm teaching **16 of 25 Biology concepts** this half-term, deferring 9 to later. The deferred topics aren't less important — skeletal system and gas exchange are substantial — but they have their own natural teaching sequences and benefit from being taught after the foundational cell biology and organisation concepts are secure.

## Reacting to the Cluster Sequence (SC-KS3-D002)

### CL001 and CL002: Cell structure, Organelle functions, Plant vs animal cells, Biological hierarchy
**My verdict: Mostly agree, but needs restructuring.**

The algorithm groups all four foundational concepts together, which is right in principle — these are the building blocks. But the "lesson count: 11" is absurd. It's suggesting 11 lessons for introduction and assessment of four concepts? I think that's a display artefact from the algorithm rather than a real recommendation.

What I'd actually do: split this into about 6-7 lessons. Cell structure needs at least 2 lessons (one theoretical, one microscopy). Organelle functions gets 1-2. Plant vs animal is a natural single lesson. Biological hierarchy is 1-2 lessons and should come *after* the cell detail work so pupils have something concrete to build the hierarchy from.

**One disagreement**: Biological hierarchy (C032) is grouped here, but I'd place it slightly later — after diffusion and unicellular organisms. The reason: I want pupils to understand that a single cell can be a complete organism (Amoeba, Euglena) before introducing the idea that in multicellular organisms, cells specialise and organise into hierarchies. It makes the "why" of hierarchy clearer. The algorithm puts hierarchy early because it's a keystone (which it is), but its keystone status means it should be *well-taught*, not necessarily *taught first*.

### CL003 and CL004: Diffusion, Diet imbalances, Enzymes as catalysts, Plant nutrition
**My verdict: This grouping makes no sense to me.**

The algorithm has clustered these because of co-teaching signals — they all link to each other through the CO_TEACHES relationships (diffusion ↔ enzymes, diffusion ↔ diet imbalances, etc.). But pedagogically, this is a mess. You can't teach enzymes as catalysts before students understand what the digestive system is. Diet imbalances requires balanced diet components first (that's an explicit prerequisite: C036 → C038). And plant nutrition, while conceptually linked to diffusion, belongs with the photosynthesis unit later in the year.

The co-teaching signal is picking up *conceptual connections* (diffusion is relevant to enzyme action, to nutrient transport, to gas exchange) but confusing "connected" with "should be taught together." Diffusion is connected to almost everything in biology. It doesn't follow that you teach diffusion, diet imbalances, enzymes and plant nutrition in one block.

**What I'd do instead**: Teach diffusion as part of the cells unit (Week 3), using it as the mechanism by which substances enter and leave cells. Then revisit diffusion later when teaching the digestive system (absorption through villi) and gas exchange (oxygen in alveoli). Spiral, not linear.

### CL005: Unicellular adaptations (standalone)
**My verdict: Agree — this is a short, focused topic.**

One lesson, maybe two if we can get pond water under microscopes. Complexity 3 is about right. The co-teaching signal linking it to Plant vs animal cells (C029) and Biological hierarchy (C032) makes sense — it's the bridge between "what cells look like" and "how cells organise into organisms."

### CL006 and CL007: Balanced diet, Energy requirements, Digestive system, Gut bacteria
**My verdict: Good grouping, this works.**

This cluster respects the prerequisite chain (balanced diet → energy calc, balanced diet → diet imbalances) and groups the nutrition/digestion content coherently. However, I'd add Diet imbalances (C038) to this cluster — it's a natural consequence of the balanced diet discussion and only needs half a lesson. The algorithm puts it in CL003, which I'm breaking apart anyway.

I'd also add Enzymes as catalysts (C040) here, since it's a prerequisite of the digestive system (C039 → C040). Enzymes make no sense without the digestive context for Year 7.

### CL008-CL014: Everything else
**My verdict: Deferred. These are Spring and Summer topics.**

CL008-009 (skeleton/muscles/gas exchange), CL010-011 (breathing/stomata/reproduction), CL012-013 (microscopy/placenta/plant reproduction/drugs) — I'm not teaching these this half-term. But I have observations:

**CL012 puts Light microscopy (C027) in the twelfth cluster.** This is the algorithm's biggest error. Microscopy must be taught in Week 1 or 2. It's directly prerequisite to understanding cell structure (the graph itself says C026 → C027). You can't have kids learning about cells for 6 weeks and only pick up a microscope in cluster 12. This suggests the algorithm is respecting the prerequisite arrow direction (cell structure → microscopy, meaning "cell structure is prerequisite of microscopy") but not understanding that microscopy is the *practical skill* that makes cell structure concrete. They're co-taught in every real classroom.

**CL008 groups skeletal structure with gas exchange.** These have a co-teaching signal (skeletal structure ↔ gas exchange) which I assume comes from the ribs protecting the lungs. It's a fair anatomical connection but a terrible teaching grouping. You'd teach the skeletal/muscular system as one coherent unit, and gas exchange as another.

---

## Keystone Concepts: Did the Graph Get It Right?

The graph flags four keystones in the Biology domain:
- **Cell structure (C026)** — Yes, absolutely. Everything starts here.
- **Diffusion (C030)** — Yes. This is the mechanism that underlies absorption, gas exchange, and transport in organisms. A pupil who doesn't understand diffusion will struggle with every organ system.
- **Biological hierarchy (C032)** — Yes. The organising principle for the whole of KS3 biology.
- **Digestive system (C039)** — Yes, but I'd argue this is a keystone for the nutrition/digestion unit specifically rather than a global keystone like cells and diffusion. Still, it's the most complex organ system we teach in detail at KS3 and it integrates mechanical digestion, chemical digestion (enzymes), absorption (diffusion again), and the role of bacteria.

**What I'd add as a keystone**: Enzymes as catalysts (C040). It's not flagged, but enzymes come back in every biology unit from here to A-level. Understanding that enzymes are specific, affected by temperature and pH, and are biological catalysts is fundamental. Every organ system involves enzymes somewhere.

**What about Working Scientifically keystones?** None are flagged, which is technically correct — the domain has no `is_keystone: YES` entries. But if I were advising the graph designers, I'd flag *Variables in experiments* (C009) as a keystone. Without a secure understanding of independent, dependent, and control variables, every practical in KS3 science falls apart.

## Working Scientifically: How I'll Embed It

The 13 Working Scientifically clusters are designed as a standalone sequence: introduction → assessment → practice → assessment → practice... all the way through. I'm ignoring this sequence entirely and instead mapping WS concepts onto the Biology lessons where they naturally arise.

Here's my mapping:

| WS Concept | Where it's taught | How |
|---|---|---|
| Scientific questioning (C007) | Lesson 1 | "What do you think you'd see if you zoomed into your skin?" |
| Risk evaluation (C006) | Lessons 3, 7, 13, 18 | Pre-practical risk assessment, every time |
| Laboratory techniques (C011) | Lessons 3-4 (microscopy), 13 (food tests), 18 (enzyme practical) | Demonstrated then practised |
| Scientific measurement (C012) | Lessons 3-4 (magnification), 14 (energy values) | Used in context |
| SI units (C022) | Lessons 3-4 (micrometres), 14 (kJ) | Introduced as needed |
| Variables in experiments (C009) | Lesson 7 (diffusion), Lesson 18 (enzyme practical) | Explicitly taught through the practical |
| Scientific prediction (C008) | Lessons 7, 13, 18 | "I predict... because..." before each practical |
| Data presentation (C016) | Lessons 4 (cell drawings), 7-8 (diffusion results), 14 (diet data) | Tables and graphs from real data |
| Pattern identification (C017) | Lessons 8, 14, 18 | Finding trends in practical data |
| Drawing conclusions (C018) | Lessons 8, 18 | Post-practical write-ups |
| Experimental design (C010) | Lesson 18 (enzyme investigation — pupils design their own) | Scaffolded design task |
| Accuracy & precision (C002) | Lesson 4 (microscope measurements) | Dartboard analogy, then applied |
| Repeatability (C003) | Lessons 7-8 (class diffusion data comparison) | "Did everyone get the same?" |

**Not explicitly taught this half-term** (these come later when the biology context demands them):
- Objectivity in science (C001) — revisit with data interpretation in Spring
- Scientific theories evolve (C004) — fits germ theory or atomic structure later
- Peer review (C005) — Year 8 or extended project
- Sampling techniques (C014) — ecology fieldwork in Summer
- Error analysis (C020) — Spring, with more complex practicals
- Statistical analysis (C025) — Spring, once more data has been collected
- Method reliability (C013) — Spring practicals
- Explaining results (C019) — develops all year, formalized in Spring
- Further questioning (C021) — develops all year
- Mathematical calculations (C015) — as needed, mainly Spring/Summer
- Scientific equations (C024) — Spring (physics: speed, density)

## Cross-Domain Integration: Where the Graph Helps and Where It Doesn't

### Where it helps:

The **co-teaching signals** between Biology concepts are genuinely useful for spotting connections I might otherwise miss. For example:
- **Diffusion ↔ Gas exchange structure** — I won't teach gas exchange this half-term, but when I do, I'll explicitly call back to the diffusion practical from Autumn 1. The signal reminds me to set this up.
- **Biological hierarchy ↔ Digestive system** — Yes, the digestive system is my main example when teaching hierarchy. The graph confirms this is a strong connection.
- **Enzymes ↔ Diffusion** — I hadn't initially planned to make this link explicit, but it's true: enzyme-digested nutrients are absorbed by diffusion through villi. Worth flagging in the digestion lessons.
- **Balanced diet ↔ Gut bacteria** — I might have given gut bacteria 5 minutes at the end of a lesson, but the co-teaching signal suggests it deserves proper treatment. Gut microbiome science has exploded in recent years and this is genuinely interesting content for Year 7.

### Where it doesn't help:

The **prerequisite chain for Working Scientifically** (C007 → C008 → C010 → C011, etc.) implies a linear teaching sequence that doesn't reflect classroom reality. You don't teach scientific questioning, then prediction, then experimental design, then lab techniques as separate topics. These are interleaved and practised simultaneously from the first practical lesson. The chain describes a logical dependency (you need to form a question before you make a prediction) but not a teaching sequence.

The **cluster algorithm's tendency to pair INTRODUCTION and ASSESSMENT clusters** for the same concepts is odd. CL001 introduces Cell structure, Organelle functions, Plant vs animal cells, Biological hierarchy. Then CL002 assesses exactly the same four concepts. But assessment shouldn't be a mirror of introduction — by the time I assess these concepts, pupils have also done practicals, drawn diagrams, compared cells, and built the hierarchy model. Assessment tests application and integration, not recall of the introduction lesson. The 1:1 introduction/assessment pairing is too mechanical.

## Practical Work Planning

Year 7 Science needs regular practicals — it's what makes the subject real and it's what the kids remember. Here's my practical allocation:

| Lesson | Practical | Type | WS Skills Embedded |
|---|---|---|---|
| L3 | Microscopy skills — setting up, focusing, looking at prepared slides | Core practical | Lab techniques, measurement |
| L4 | Observing real cells — onion epidermal cells + cheek cells, staining with iodine/methylene blue | Core practical | Lab techniques, measurement, data presentation (scientific drawing) |
| L6 | Plant vs animal cell observation (microscopy comparison) | Supporting practical | Accuracy, recording |
| L7 | Diffusion demonstration — potassium permanganate in water, food colouring in agar | Demo + observation | Prediction, variables, data presentation |
| L9 | Observing unicellular organisms (pond water or prepared slides) | Supporting practical | Observation, recording |
| L13 | Food tests — Benedict's, iodine, Biuret, ethanol emulsion | Core practical | Risk evaluation, lab techniques, variables |
| L18 | Enzyme investigation — effect of temperature on amylase | Core practical | Experimental design, variables, prediction, data presentation, drawing conclusions |

That's 7 lessons with practical elements out of 21, which is about a third. For Y7 Biology in Autumn 1, that's realistic. The enzyme investigation (L18) is the big one — that's where pupils design their own investigation for the first time, with scaffolding. Every other practical builds skills towards this.

## Teaching Weights and Complexity: Using the Data

The `teaching_weight` and `complexity_level` data is useful for time allocation:

**High weight, low complexity (teach thoroughly, accessible to all):**
- Cell structure (weight 3, complexity 2) — 2 lessons, lots of visual support
- Balanced diet components (weight 2, complexity 2) — 1 lesson, but rich practical context (food tests)
- Plant vs animal cells (weight 2, complexity 2) — 1 lesson, comparison focus

**High weight, high complexity (needs careful scaffolding):**
- Diffusion (weight 3, complexity 3) — 2 lessons, the particle model is abstract for Y7
- Digestive system (weight 3, complexity 3) — 2 lessons, lots of new terminology
- Enzymes as catalysts (weight 3, complexity 3) — 1.5 lessons (intro + practical)
- Light microscopy (weight 3, complexity 3) — 2 lessons, heavy on practical skills

**Lower weight, lower complexity (can be taught more quickly):**
- Diet imbalances (weight 2, complexity 2) — 0.5-1 lesson, builds on prior knowledge
- Gut bacteria (weight 2, complexity 2) — 0.5 lesson, but genuinely interesting
- Unicellular adaptations (weight 3, complexity 3) — 1 lesson

**The biomechanics outlier**: weight 5, complexity 4 — the highest weight in the whole domain. I'm deferring it to Spring, but when I do teach it, it'll need significant time. The weight 5 signals that this concept has heavy connections and is hard to teach, which matches my experience: kids struggle with levers and moments in a biology context.

## Differentiation Strategy

### Stretching high-attainers:
- **Cells unit**: Introduce prokaryotic vs eukaryotic distinction (mentioned in vocabulary for C026). Challenge them to calculate actual cell sizes from microscope images using magnification formula.
- **Diffusion**: Introduce concentration gradient quantitatively. Ask: "Why does diffusion speed up when you heat the water?" (links to particle model from KS2/KS3 physics).
- **Digestion**: Research a specific enzyme in more detail (e.g., pepsin — why does it need acid?). Compare digestive systems of different organisms.
- **Enzyme practical**: Design an investigation with multiple variables. Analyse data using means and identify anomalies.

### Supporting lower-attainers:
- **Cells unit**: Heavy use of visual scaffolds — labelled diagrams, card sorts, 3D models. Focus on the 4 main organelles before adding complexity. Use sentence frames for descriptions.
- **Diffusion**: Keep it concrete — the potassium permanganate demo is powerful. Use the "crowded room" analogy. Don't push the particle model too hard; focus on the observable phenomenon first.
- **Digestion**: Provide a torso model they can touch. Use the "journey of a sandwich" narrative. Pre-teach vocabulary using a glossary bookmark.
- **Enzyme practical**: Provide a structured method rather than asking them to design. Give results tables with headings pre-filled. Focus on describing what happened rather than explaining why.

The complexity data from the graph is helpful here — concepts rated complexity 2 (Cell structure, Plant vs animal, Balanced diet, Diet imbalances, Stomata, Gut bacteria, Drug effects, Skeletal structure) are the ones where all pupils should achieve secure understanding. Complexity 3-4 concepts (Diffusion, Microscopy, Enzymes, Biomechanics, Biological hierarchy) are where differentiation becomes essential.

---

## Assessment Strategy

### Formative assessment (ongoing):
- **Every lesson**: Mini-whiteboards for quick-fire recall questions at the start
- **Exit tickets**: End of each lesson, one question that checks the key concept
- **Practical skills checklist**: Pupils self-assess microscopy skills (L3-4, L6)
- **Hinge questions**: Planned diagnostic questions at key decision points (e.g., "Is this cell plant or animal? How do you know?" after L6)

### Summative assessment:
- **Lesson 11 (end of Week 4)**: Cells topic test — covers Cell structure, Microscopy, Organelle functions, Plant vs animal, Diffusion, Unicellular organisms, Biological hierarchy. Mix of multiple choice, labelling, short answer, one extended writing question (describe and explain). 30 minutes, done in lesson time.
- **Lesson 21 (end of Week 7)**: End of half-term assessment — covers everything taught in Autumn 1. Include a data analysis question using unfamiliar context to assess WS skills. 40-45 minutes. Can be done formally or as a "show what you know" task with differentiated question levels.

### Assessment vs the cluster model:
The graph's approach of having ASSESSMENT clusters that mirror PRACTICE clusters doesn't match how I assess. I don't assess "the four concepts from CL001" as a discrete test. I assess understanding across the unit, including the ability to link concepts together. The most important assessment question on my cells test won't be "label this diagram" — it'll be "Explain why plant cells have chloroplasts but root cells don't" (which requires organelle function knowledge, plant vs animal cell understanding, AND an understanding that not all plant cells are the same). The cluster model doesn't capture these integrative assessment opportunities.

---

## Lesson-by-Lesson Sequence: My Reasoning

### Week 1: Welcome to Biology — The Cell

**Lesson 1 — What are living things made of?**
Start with the big picture. Show them images at different magnifications: human → organ → tissue → cell. Blow their minds with the fact that they're made of about 37 trillion cells. Introduce cell structure with a simple animal cell diagram. Low complexity entry point (C026 is complexity 2), accessible to all.

**Lesson 2 — Inside the cell: organelles and their jobs**
Deepen from structure to function. Each organelle has a job — nucleus (instructions), mitochondria (energy), cell membrane (gatekeeper). Use the "cell is like a factory" analogy cautiously (it helps but can also mislead). The CO_TEACHES signal between Cell structure and Organelle functions confirms these two should be taught back-to-back.

**Lesson 3 — Using the microscope**
First practical. Microscopy MUST come here, not in cluster 12 as the algorithm suggests. The prerequisite chain says C026 → C027 (cell structure before microscopy), which I'm respecting — they've had two lessons on what cells look like before they try to see one. Teach the skill sequence: carry correctly, set up, start on lowest magnification, focus. Use prepared slides (letter 'e', fabric fibres) to practise before looking at cells.

### Week 2: Seeing Cells and Comparing Them

**Lesson 4 — Observing real cells under the microscope**
The money lesson. Onion epidermal cells stained with iodine. Cheek cells stained with methylene blue. Pupils produce labelled scientific drawings with a scale bar. This is where the WS skills of scientific measurement and data presentation are first properly practised. Calculate magnification.

**Lesson 5 — Organelle functions in depth + review**
Revisit and deepen organelle functions. Card sort: match organelle to function. Address the misconceptions flagged in the graph (the nucleus isn't a "brain," not all plant cells have chloroplasts). Quick assessment: can they explain what each organelle does without looking at notes?

**Lesson 6 — Plant vs animal cells**
Comparison lesson. Look at plant cells (with cell wall, chloroplasts, large vacuole) and animal cells side by side under the microscope. Venn diagram activity. The CO_TEACHES signal between Plant vs animal cells ↔ Cell structure and Plant vs animal cells ↔ Organelle functions confirms this is the right place — it synthesises everything from the first week.

### Week 3: How Substances Move + Unicellular Life

**Lesson 7 — Diffusion: the movement of particles**
Keystone concept. Demo: drop potassium permanganate into a beaker of still water. "I predict... because..." before the demo. Introduce the particle model explanation. This is complexity 3, so I need to scaffold the abstract thinking. Use the "crowded room" analogy: people naturally spread out from a crowded area to an empty one. The CO_TEACHES signal linking Diffusion ↔ Gas exchange structure reminds me to say: "We'll come back to diffusion when we study breathing — it's the same process happening in your lungs right now."

**Lesson 8 — Diffusion in living things**
Apply diffusion to biology: oxygen entering blood cells, carbon dioxide leaving, nutrients being absorbed. Use agar jelly cubes with indicator to show that surface area affects diffusion rate. Class discussion of results — why did the small cube change colour fastest? This is where repeatability (C003) gets taught naturally: "Did your group get the same result as the next table?"

**Lesson 9 — Unicellular organisms: one cell does everything**
Amoeba, Euglena, Paramecium. Show how a single cell can carry out all seven life processes. If we can get pond water, fantastic — microscope observation. If not, use video microscopy. This lesson bridges the cell unit and the organisation unit: "These organisms are just one cell. But you're made of 37 trillion cells. How does that work?"

### Week 4: Organisation + First Assessment

**Lesson 10 — From cells to organisms: biological hierarchy**
The third keystone. Build the hierarchy: cell → tissue → organ → organ system → organism. Use the digestive system as the running example (setting up for Week 6). Pupils create a poster or foldable showing the hierarchy with real examples at each level. The CO_TEACHES signals linking Biological hierarchy ↔ Cell structure and Biological hierarchy ↔ Digestive system confirm this is the right bridge lesson.

**Lesson 11 — Cells assessment**
Topic test on the cells unit. Covers C026-C032 (cell structure, microscopy, organelles, plant vs animal, diffusion, unicellular organisms, hierarchy). 30-minute written assessment: 10 multiple choice, 3 short answer, 1 extended writing. Remaining 30 minutes for self-assessment and gap identification.

**Lesson 12 — Balanced diet: what your body needs**
Transition to the nutrition unit. Start with what pupils already know — most Y7s have encountered food groups at KS2. Introduce the seven nutrient groups with food labels. Low complexity (C036 is complexity 2), so this is accessible after the cognitive load of the test. The teaching weight of 2 suggests this can be handled efficiently, but the CO_TEACHES links to almost everything in the nutrition cluster, so it's worth getting right.

### Week 5: Nutrition in Depth

**Lesson 13 — Food tests practical**
Core practical. Test real foods for starch (iodine), reducing sugars (Benedict's), protein (Biuret), and fats (ethanol emulsion test). This is a skills-heavy lesson — risk evaluation, lab techniques, recording results. It also brings Working Scientifically concepts (C006, C011) to life in a way that a standalone "how to do a risk assessment" lesson never could.

**Lesson 14 — Energy requirements: counting kilojoules**
Mathematical calculations in science (WS C015) embedded naturally. Pupils calculate the energy content of meals using food labels. Compare their totals with recommended daily intakes. Discuss why requirements vary by age, sex, and activity level. This is weight 3, complexity 3 — the maths will challenge some, so I'll provide calculation frames.

**Lesson 15 — Diet imbalances: what goes wrong**
Consequences of too much, too little, or the wrong balance. Obesity, starvation, deficiency diseases (scurvy, rickets, anaemia). Use data on UK obesity statistics — Pattern identification (WS C017) in action. Address the misconception that malnutrition only means "not eating enough." Low complexity (C038 is complexity 2), so this can be handled in one lesson with case study analysis.

### Week 6: Digestion

**Lesson 16 — The digestive system: the journey of food**
Keystone concept lesson. Trace food from mouth to anus, organ by organ. Use a torso model. Distinguish mechanical digestion (physical breakdown) from chemical digestion (enzymes). Lots of new vocabulary — provide a glossary. This is where Biological hierarchy (C032) pays off: pupils can identify tissues and organs within the system because they already know what those words mean.

**Lesson 17 — Enzymes: biological catalysts**
Introduce enzymes as proteins that speed up digestion. Lock-and-key model. Three digestive enzymes: amylase (starch → sugars), protease (proteins → amino acids), lipase (fats → fatty acids + glycerol). Address the "enzymes are alive/killed" misconception. This is complexity 3 and arguably the most conceptually challenging lesson in the half-term — the idea of catalysis is genuinely abstract for 11-year-olds.

**Lesson 18 — Enzyme investigation: amylase practical**
The big practical. Pupils investigate the effect of temperature on amylase activity using iodine solution to test for starch breakdown. This is where experimental design (WS C010) is explicitly taught and practised: identify variables, plan method, make predictions, collect data, draw conclusions. I'll differentiate by giving lower-attainers a structured method while higher-attainers design their own with scaffolding. This is the most WS-rich lesson of the half-term.

### Week 7: Finishing the Story + Assessment

**Lesson 19 — Gut bacteria and digestive health**
The microbiome. Gut bacteria help break down fibre, synthesise vitamins, protect against pathogens. This is weight 2, complexity 2 — it's accessible and inherently fascinating to Year 7 ("you have more bacteria in your gut than cells in your body" — technically not true anymore, but the point lands). The CO_TEACHES signals linking Gut bacteria ↔ Balanced diet and Gut bacteria ↔ Diet imbalances confirm this is a good capstone for the nutrition unit.

**Lesson 20 — Revision and retrieval practice**
Structured revision. Low-stakes quizzing, concept mapping, practice questions. Revisit the four keystones (cell structure, diffusion, biological hierarchy, digestive system) and check they're secure. Peer teaching — pupils explain a concept to a partner using only a mini-whiteboard.

**Lesson 21 — End of half-term assessment**
Formal written assessment covering the entire half-term. Longer than the cells test: 40-45 minutes. Include a data analysis question on an unfamiliar context to assess Working Scientifically skills. Extended writing question: "Explain how the food you eat at lunchtime is broken down and absorbed into your body" (requires hierarchy, digestion, enzymes, diffusion — integrates everything).

---

## What I'm Happy With

1. **The keystone flagging is genuinely useful.** Knowing that Cell structure, Diffusion, Biological hierarchy, and Digestive system are keystones helped me allocate time. Each gets 2+ lessons.

2. **The co-teaching signals revealed connections I'd underweight.** Especially Gut bacteria ↔ Balanced diet and Enzymes ↔ Diffusion. These are real pedagogical connections worth making explicit.

3. **The teaching weight data matches my instincts.** Biomechanics (weight 5) is the hardest thing in this domain — confirmed by every year I've taught it. Good that the graph recognises this.

4. **The prerequisite chains are solid.** Cell structure before microscopy, balanced diet before diet imbalances, digestive system before enzymes — these are real dependencies and the graph has them right.

5. **The complexity data helps differentiation planning.** Having a 1-4 scale for each concept gives me a quick proxy for "how much scaffolding will this need?"

## What I'd Feed Back to the Graph Designers

1. **Working Scientifically should not be clustered as a standalone domain for lesson planning.** It's a skills layer that maps *onto* content domains, not a parallel teaching track. The 13 WS clusters are essentially unusable in their current form. What would be useful: a "WS skills naturally embedded in this cluster" annotation on the Biology clusters.

2. **The algorithm's clustering is sometimes driven by co-teaching signal density rather than pedagogical logic.** CL003 (Diffusion + Diet imbalances + Enzymes + Plant nutrition) is the clearest example — these concepts are connected, but they're not a coherent teaching unit.

3. **Microscopy in cluster 12 is a serious sequencing error.** Any teacher using this tool would immediately move microscopy to Week 1-2. The prerequisite chain (C026 → C027) says "you need cell structure before microscopy," which the algorithm interprets as "teach cell structure first, then get to microscopy eventually." In reality, microscopy is how you TEACH cell structure — they're co-delivered.

4. **The 1:1 INTRODUCTION/ASSESSMENT cluster pairing is too rigid.** Assessment isn't a separate cluster — it's ongoing and formative, with summative checkpoints at natural breaks in the content.

5. **The concept grouping for gas exchange is split oddly.** Gas exchange structure (C043) is in CL008 with skeleton/muscles, while Breathing mechanism (C044) is in CL010 with stomata and reproduction. These should be together.

6. **Add a "half-term scope" indication.** 25 concepts in one domain is a full year of Y7 biology. It would be useful to have the graph suggest which concepts form natural half-term units based on prerequisite chains and keystone boundaries.

---

## Final Reflection

The graph context gave me a richer starting point than a blank scheme of work template. The prerequisite chains validated my instinctive sequencing. The keystones focused my time allocation. The co-teaching signals suggested connections I'd make explicit. The teaching weight and complexity data streamlined my differentiation planning.

But it needed a teacher's judgement to turn it into a workable half-term. The algorithm clusters are a starting point, not a plan. The Working Scientifically domain needs to be dissolved into the content teaching. And 27 clusters for 21 lessons required exactly the kind of prioritisation and deferral that an algorithm struggles with: What do these particular children, in this particular school, need to learn first?

The answer, as always in Year 7 Autumn 1 Biology, is cells and food. Everything else builds from there.
