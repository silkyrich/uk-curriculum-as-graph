## Lesson 1 — Cells: The Building Blocks of Life (Monday P2)

### What happened

The brick wall/honeycomb/cell image starter worked better than expected. Three pupils immediately said "they're all made of smaller bits" before I'd even asked the question. One pupil (J.) said "they're all patterns" — I noted this as a natural use of the Patterns lens, even though I was aiming for Structure and Function. Good instinct. I redirected: "Yes, but WHY are they built from small repeating units? What does that structure ENABLE them to do?" That got them thinking functionally rather than just observationally.

The 3D cell models were essential. When I showed the textbook diagram first, several pupils immediately started drawing flat circles with dots inside. When I passed round the 3D model, there was a visible shift — "Oh, it's like a ball, not a circle." The misconception that cells are flat 2D structures is exactly as the graph predicts (C026 misconception data). I need those models on the front bench for the rest of the week.

The mini whiteboard check at the end was sobering. About half the class drew a cell with the nucleus, cytoplasm, and cell membrane correctly. The other half either forgot the cell membrane entirely (drew the nucleus floating in cytoplasm with nothing around it) or confused the nucleus and the cell. Three pupils drew the nucleus as the entire cell with organelles inside it — as if "nucleus" meant "cell." I'll need to address this explicitly in L2 before they look down the microscopes.

### What the graph data helped with

The C026 teaching guidance ("Begin with the concept that all living things are made of cells") gave me a clean entry point. The misconception data — "cells are flat, 2D structures because they see flat diagrams" — meant I had the 3D models ready from the start rather than introducing them as a correction later. Proactive, not reactive.

The key vocabulary list from C026 was comprehensive. I used "organelle" early (lesson 1) which I might not normally do with Y7 — but having it on the graph's vocabulary list reminded me it's a term they need.

### Differentiation notes

The stretch question ("Why might different types of cell look different?") engaged three or four higher-attaining pupils. One pupil (A.) immediately said "because they have different jobs" — she is going to thrive when we get to specialisation in L7.

The support scaffold (pre-labelled diagram for matching) was used by about five pupils. The rest managed from the model.

## Lesson 2 — Looking at Cells: Introduction to Microscopy (Tuesday P3)

### What happened

Microscopy day. This is always the lesson where the reality of practical science hits. 28 pupils, 15 microscopes, glass slides, stains. Here is what went well and what did not.

**What went well:**
- The safety briefing was tight. I used the CV001 safety notes as my checklist: "Handle glass slides carefully. Iodine stains skin and clothing. Do not taste stains." One pupil asked why we'd need to be told not to taste stains. Fair point — but experience has taught me that at least one Y7 pupil per year will try.
- My demonstration of the microscope skills sequence worked. Starting on the LOWEST magnification objective (x4), looking from the side while lowering the objective to avoid crushing the slide, then switching up. I did this twice: once at my bench with the class gathered round, once on the visualiser camera so they could see the slide movement on the projector.
- About 60% of pairs got a focused image of the onion epidermis at x40 within 10 minutes. They could see the regular brick-wall pattern of cell walls and the dark-stained nuclei.

**What went wrong:**
- Four microscopes were not focusing properly. The technician had cleaned the lenses but two had sticky coarse focus knobs and two had dim bulbs. I should have checked these myself on Monday afternoon. Next time: test every microscope before the first lesson.
- Cheek cell slides were difficult. Three pairs could not find any cells at all — the methylene blue staining was too faint on the prepared slides we had. The cell membrane is almost invisible under a school light microscope without strong staining. I ended up doing cheek cells as a teacher demonstration under the visualiser camera instead of a class practical. This is a CV001 issue — the equipment list includes "prepared slides (cheek cells)" but in practice, pre-stained cheek cell slides from the supplier are often poor. Fresh cheek cells, scraped and stained by the pupil, give a better result — but the hygiene protocol is significant (no sharing scrapers, antiseptic wash, proper disposal) and I did not have time to set that up today.
- Scientific drawing conventions need more explicit teaching than I gave them. I showed one example and set them going, but when I circulated, many pupils were drawing with thick pen lines, colouring in the cytoplasm, and using wonky freehand label lines. I should have provided a "good drawing / bad drawing" comparison on the board. Will add this in L3.

**Pupil diagrams — what they revealed:**
- Most pupils drew the onion cells accurately as regular rectangular shapes with clear cell walls. Good.
- Very few included the vacuole — even though it takes up most of the cell. They drew the nucleus and cytoplasm but the vacuole was invisible to them because it just looks like empty space through the microscope. I need to explicitly point out: "That large empty-looking area IS the vacuole. It is full of cell sap."
- Three pupils labelled the cell wall as "cell membrane." This is the exact misconception flagged in C026: "Students sometimes think the cell membrane and cell wall are the same." I corrected on the spot: the wall is the rigid outer layer (cellulose, structural support); the membrane is the thin layer inside the wall (controls what enters and leaves).

### Safety observations

No incidents. One broken slide (dropped, not cut). Pupil reported it, I swept fragments into the sharps bin. The iodine stain dripped on two pupils' hands — yellow staining. They washed immediately. No skin reaction. One pupil had her hair very close to the microscope stage — I reminded about tying hair back. The CV001 safety notes do not mention hair, but they should — it is a standard microscopy safety point.

### What the graph data helped with

The CV001 recording format ("labelled scientific diagrams with magnification -> comparison table -> calculation of actual size") gave me a clear sequence for the practical. I used the first step today (diagrams with magnification) and will build to the comparison table in L4 and calculation in L4.

The CV001 assessment criteria ("Can pupils prepare a microscope slide and focus the microscope correctly?") gave me a concrete thing to check as I circulated. About 18 of 28 pupils could do this independently by the end of the lesson. The other 10 needed significant support with focusing.

### Technician request update

Sent a note to the technician: please check all microscope bulbs and focus knobs for Thursday. Also requested fresh onions and blank slides for L3 (pupils making their own slides).

## Lesson 3 — Making Your Own Slides (Wednesday P5)

### What happened

This is the lesson I look forward to most in the cells unit. Pupils making their own slides transforms them from passive observers into scientists.

**Slide preparation — the demo:**
I did the demo on the visualiser camera so the entire class could see my hands. Step by step: peel the epidermis (thin, single layer — this is the hard part), place flat on the slide, add iodine, lower the cover slip at 45 degrees. I emphasised the 45-degree angle repeatedly. In past years, roughly half the class drops the cover slip flat, trapping a massive air bubble that obscures everything.

**Results:**
- About 12 pairs (out of 14) successfully prepared a slide with visible cells. This is better than average. The explicit 45-degree instruction helped.
- Two pairs tore the epidermis so it was folded and layered — they could see cells but the layers overlapped confusingly. I gave them a second piece of onion.
- The iodine staining was much more effective on fresh slides than on the old prepared slides. The nuclei were dark and clear. Several pupils exclaimed "I can see the nuclei!" with genuine excitement.
- I introduced organelle functions (from C028) as pupils observed. "You can see the nucleus — what does it contain? DNA. What does it do? Controls the cell by carrying the genetic instructions."

**Scientific drawing improvement:**
I put a "good drawing vs bad drawing" comparison on the board before the practical started. Good: sharp pencil, clear lines, ruler-straight labels, title, magnification. Bad: pen, coloured-in, wobbly labels crossing each other, no title. This made a dramatic difference. The drawings produced today were significantly better than Tuesday. About 20 pupils produced drawings I would accept as exam-standard.

**Organelle functions — whiteboard quiz:**
The quick-fire quiz at the end (I say organelle, you write function) showed that nucleus and cell membrane are well-understood, but mitochondria is shaky. Only about 10 pupils correctly wrote "respiration" or "energy release" for mitochondria. The rest wrote things like "powerhouse" (correct idea, wrong vocabulary) or "gives energy" (vague) or left it blank. I need to revisit mitochondria in L4.

The misconception about nucleus as "the brain of the cell" appeared three times. The C028 misconception data flags this: "clarify that the nucleus contains the genetic instructions (DNA) but does not actively direct processes moment by moment." I used the analogy: "The nucleus is more like a recipe book than a brain. It has all the instructions, but it doesn't sit there directing traffic in real time."

### Safety observations

One pupil pricked her finger with the mounted needle — very minor, no blood. Washed with antiseptic, plaster applied. Reminded the class: "point away from yourself and others." The CV001 safety notes do not mention mounted needles specifically. The equipment list includes "mounted needles" but the safety notes only mention "Handle glass slides carefully." This is a gap — mounted needles are a standard microscopy hazard and should be in the safety notes.

### Differentiation in practice

The backup prepared slides (for support pupils) were only needed by one pair who could not peel the epidermis thin enough after three attempts. Rather than letting them become frustrated, I gave them a pre-made slide so they could participate in the observation and drawing.

The stretch question ("Compare your slide to the prepared one — which is clearer and why?") generated thoughtful responses. One pupil wrote: "The prepared slide is clearer because the layer is perfectly thin and evenly stained. My slide has some dark patches where the iodine pooled." This is genuine evaluation of method quality.

## Lesson 4 — Plant vs Animal Cells: Comparing Structures (Thursday P2)

### What happened

**Retrieval practice starter:**
Unlabelled cell diagram on the board, 2 minutes, whiteboards. Improvement from L1 is visible: 22 of 28 pupils correctly labelled nucleus, cytoplasm, cell membrane, and cell wall. Six still forgot the cell membrane. I am going to do this same starter again at the beginning of L6 (after the weekend) to check retention.

**Comparison microscopy:**
Pupils had an onion cell slide from L3 and a prepared cheek cell slide. Side by side. I asked: "What can you see that is the same? What is different?" This worked beautifully as a discovery task. Within 5 minutes, most pupils had noticed:
- Onion cells are rectangular with clear walls; cheek cells are irregular, rounded
- Onion cells have visible nuclei; cheek cell nuclei are harder to see
- Onion cells look "empty" in the middle (the vacuole); cheek cells do not

I then built the comparison table on the board, with the Structure and Function column. The key question: "Plant cells have cell walls, chloroplasts, and large vacuoles. WHY? What function do these structures serve?" This is where the thinking lens really paid off. Instead of just listing differences, pupils had to explain each one:
- Cell wall provides rigid support — plants don't have skeletons, so every cell must support itself
- Chloroplasts enable photosynthesis — plants make their own food, animals eat other organisms
- Large vacuole maintains turgor pressure — keeps the plant upright

The misconception about plant cells lacking mitochondria (from C029 data) appeared predictably. When I said "plant cells also have mitochondria," at least five pupils looked confused. One said "but they have chloroplasts for energy." I used the day/night argument: "Do plants stop living at night? No. They still need energy. Chloroplasts only work in the light. Mitochondria work all the time."

**Magnification calculation:**
The formula (magnification = image size / actual size) was harder than expected. The main issue was unit conversion. Pupils measured their drawings in cm, but actual cell sizes are given in micrometres. Converting between mm, micrometres, and cm tripped up about a third of the class. I did two worked examples instead of one, explicitly showing the unit conversion step. By the third practice problem, about 20 pupils were getting correct answers.

### What the graph data helped with

The C029 misconception data was spot-on. I had three misconceptions ready to address and all three appeared in the lesson. The teaching guidance for C029 ("Use a Venn diagram to compare and contrast") is a valid approach but I preferred the comparison table because it allowed the Structure and Function column. Either would work.

The cross-domain CO_TEACHES link between C029 (plant vs animal cells) and C026/C028 confirmed that this lesson should reference cell structure and organelle functions — which is exactly what the comparison table does.

### Differentiation in practice

The stretch question about root cells lacking chloroplasts is one I specifically took from the misconception data. It appeared in the L5 assessment as well (question 3). Two pupils nailed the answer: "Root cells are underground so they don't get light, which means photosynthesis can't happen there, so there's no point having chloroplasts." Clear causal reasoning.

## Lesson 5 — Checkpoint Assessment: Cells and Microscopy (Friday P4)

### What happened

**Assessment conditions:** 25 minutes writing, 25 minutes review.

**Results overview (marked during the review period and over the weekend):**

| Question | Topic | Mean score | Common errors |
|----------|-------|-----------|---------------|
| Q1 (4 marks) | Label plant cell | 3.1 / 4 | Forgetting cell membrane (6 pupils). Confusing vacuole with cytoplasm (3 pupils). |
| Q2 (6 marks) | Plant or animal? + magnification | 4.2 / 6 | Magnification calculation unit errors (8 pupils). |
| Q3 (4 marks) | Root cells misconception | 2.8 / 4 | 5 pupils agreed the student was correct (that root cells "aren't real plant cells"). 4 pupils said root cells do have chloroplasts. |
| Q4 (4 marks) | Structure and Function — alveoli | 2.3 / 4 | Weakest question. Many pupils described alveoli but did not link structure to function explicitly. |

**Total mean: 12.4 / 18 (69%)**

**Analysis:**
- Cell structure knowledge (Q1-2) is solid. Most pupils can label cells and calculate magnification (with unit conversion still needing practice).
- The root cell misconception (Q3) was partially addressed but not fully resolved. 5 pupils who stated root cells "aren't real plant cells because they lack chloroplasts" need targeted intervention. The C029 misconception data is accurate: this is persistent.
- The Structure and Function question (Q4) showed that many pupils can DESCRIBE a structure but struggle to EXPLAIN how it links to function. This is the higher-order thinking the lens aims to develop. I need to model more "structure enables function" explanations before expecting pupils to write them independently.

**The review period:**
I displayed model answers on the board and pupils self-corrected in green pen. For Q3, I drew a plant with arrows showing "leaf cells (light!) = chloroplasts" and "root cells (dark!) = no chloroplasts but still have cell wall, nucleus, etc." Three of the five "incorrect" pupils clearly had an "aha" moment. The other two may need one-to-one follow-up.

### Reflection on the week

**What worked:**
1. The Structure and Function lens gave every lesson a cognitive through-line. Instead of learning disconnected facts, pupils were repeatedly asking "why is it built this way?" This is more demanding than straight recall but it means the understanding is deeper.
2. The CV001 success criteria gave me concrete targets to assess against. I know exactly which pupils can use a microscope and which cannot.
3. The misconception data from the graph was accurate in every case. Every misconception flagged in C026-C029 appeared in my classroom this week. Having the corrections ready in advance saved time and allowed proactive teaching.
4. The microscopy practicals (L2-L4) gave pupils a genuine sense of discovery. Looking at real cells through a microscope is qualitatively different from looking at a textbook diagram.

**What I would change:**
1. Check microscopes personally before the first lesson. Two non-functioning microscopes caused unnecessary disruption.
2. Spend more time on scientific drawing conventions in L2 — the "good drawing vs bad drawing" comparison should be lesson 2, not lesson 3.
3. Cheek cell slides from the supplier were inadequate. Next year, I will either prepare fresh cheek cell slides myself (with proper hygiene protocol planned in advance) or find a better supplier of pre-stained slides.
4. The magnification calculation in L4 needed more scaffolded practice on unit conversion. I would add a warm-up exercise on converting mm to micrometres before introducing the magnification formula.
5. The Structure and Function explanations (Q4 in the assessment) showed that pupils need MORE modelled examples of "structure enables function" writing. I will build this into L6-L7 next week with sentence frames.

**CV001 vehicle evaluation (from the classroom):**
- Equipment list was accurate and complete, except cheek cell slides need a quality note
- Safety notes need to include: mounted needles, hair near microscope stage
- The recording format sequence (diagrams -> comparison table -> calculation) worked well as a lesson-by-lesson progression
- The assessment criteria and success criteria mapped directly to what I assessed in L5 — this is genuinely useful

**Next week:**
Week 2 shifts from cells-as-structures to cells-as-parts-of-systems. The biological hierarchy (L6) is the bridge. Diffusion (L8) is the keystone concept for understanding how substances move through living systems. By the end of Week 2, pupils should see cells not as isolated objects under a microscope but as functional units within a hierarchical, interdependent system. The thinking lens transition from Structure and Function to Systems and System Models reflects this shift.
