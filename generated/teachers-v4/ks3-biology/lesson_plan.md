## WEEK 1: CELLS — Structure, Microscopy and Organelles

**Thinking Lens (primary):** Structure and Function — "How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?"

**Content Vehicle:** SC-KS3-CV001 (Cell Structure and Microscopy)

### Lesson 1 — Cells: The Building Blocks of Life
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C026 (Cell structure) [KEYSTONE]
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D002-CL001 (introduction)
**Type:** New content — teacher-led with discussion

**Learning objective:** Describe cells as the fundamental unit of living organisms and identify the main structures of a cell.

**Thinking Lens starter (5 min):** Show a photograph of a brick wall, a honeycomb, and a microscope image of cells. Ask: "What do these three images have in common?" Elicit the idea of repeating units that build larger structures. Introduce the key question: "How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?" This question will frame the entire cells unit.

**Main (35 min):**
- Introduce cells as the fundamental unit of all living organisms. Every living thing — from a bacterium to a blue whale — is made of cells.
- Use the 3D cell models (animal and plant) to identify key structures: nucleus, cytoplasm, cell membrane. Pupils sketch and annotate from the model.
- Concept check: What does each part DO? Apply the Structure and Function lens — the nucleus contains DNA and controls the cell; the cell membrane controls what enters and leaves; the cytoplasm is where chemical reactions occur.
- Address misconception: cells are NOT flat 2D shapes. The diagrams in textbooks are cross-sections. Pass round the 3D models.

**Key vocabulary:** cell, nucleus, cytoplasm, cell membrane, organelle, unicellular, multicellular

**Differentiation:**
- *Support:* Pre-labelled diagram scaffold — pupils match labels to the model
- *Stretch:* Why might different types of cell look different from each other? (Forward hook to specialisation)

**Formative assessment:** Mini whiteboard — draw and label an animal cell from memory. Circulate and check for: (1) enclosed membrane, (2) nucleus present, (3) cytoplasm filling the space.

**Homework:** Vocabulary drill — define cell, nucleus, cytoplasm, cell membrane in own words.

---

### Lesson 2 — Looking at Cells: Introduction to Microscopy (PRACTICAL)
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C027 (Light microscopy), SC-KS3-C026 (Cell structure)
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D002-CL001 (introduction)
**Type:** Practical — observation enquiry (CV001)
**WS Focus:** WS-KS3-002 (Making accurate observations), WS-KS3-004 (Using apparatus correctly)

**Learning objective:** Use a light microscope to observe prepared slides of plant and animal cells, and record observations as labelled scientific diagrams.

**Safety briefing (5 min):**
- Glass slides break — report immediately, use sharps bin, do not pick up fragments with fingers
- Iodine stains skin and clothing — avoid contact, wash immediately if spilled
- Carry microscopes with BOTH hands (one on arm, one under base)
- Do NOT taste any stains

**Microscope skills sequence (15 min — teacher demo then paired practice):**
1. Carry the microscope correctly to bench
2. Plug in and switch on the lamp
3. Start on the LOWEST magnification objective (x4)
4. Place the prepared slide on the stage, secure with clips
5. Use the coarse focus knob to bring the image into focus (looking from the side first to avoid crushing the slide)
6. Switch to medium magnification (x10), refocus with fine focus
7. Both eyes open when looking through the eyepiece

**Practical (25 min):**
- Observe prepared onion epidermis slide (stained with iodine) — identify cell wall, nucleus, cytoplasm, vacuole
- Observe prepared cheek cell slide (stained with methylene blue) — identify cell membrane, nucleus, cytoplasm
- Draw ONE plant cell and ONE animal cell following scientific drawing conventions:
  - Sharp pencil, no colouring
  - Clear, unbroken lines
  - Labels with ruled lines, no crossing
  - Title including magnification

**Recording format (from CV001):** Labelled scientific diagrams with magnification

**Differentiation:**
- *Support:* Printed scaffold with boxes for drawing and label lines pre-drawn
- *Stretch:* Attempt to calculate magnification — eyepiece (x10) times objective (x4 = x40 total). What does "x40" actually mean?

**Plenary (5 min):** Peer review — swap diagrams with a partner. Check: are the lines sharp? Are all labels present? Is the magnification recorded?

---

### Lesson 3 — Making Your Own Slides (PRACTICAL)
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C027 (Light microscopy), SC-KS3-C028 (Cell organelle functions)
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D002-CL001 (introduction)
**Type:** Practical — skill development (CV001)
**WS Focus:** WS-KS3-002 (Making accurate observations), WS-KS3-004 (Using apparatus correctly)

**Learning objective:** Prepare a microscope slide of onion epidermis, stain it, and observe organelles under the microscope.

**Safety briefing (3 min):**
- All L2 safety points apply
- Mounted needles are sharp — point away from yourself and others
- Peel onion epidermis carefully — thin, single layer only
- Drop cover slip at an angle (45 degrees) to avoid air bubbles

**Slide preparation demo (10 min — teacher demonstrates each step):**
1. Peel a thin layer of epidermis from an onion using forceps
2. Place flat on a clean glass slide (no folds or wrinkles)
3. Add 1-2 drops of iodine stain
4. Lower cover slip at 45 degrees using a mounted needle to avoid air bubbles
5. Blot excess stain with filter paper
6. Place on microscope stage

**Practical (30 min):**
- Each pair prepares their own onion epidermis slide
- Observe at x40 and x100
- Draw labelled diagram of onion cells — identify: cell wall, nucleus (stained dark by iodine), cytoplasm, vacuole
- Introduce organelle functions (from C028):
  - Nucleus — contains DNA, controls the cell
  - Mitochondria — site of respiration (energy release) — "Why can't we see mitochondria?" (Too small for a light microscope — need an electron microscope)
  - Cell membrane — selectively permeable barrier
  - Cytoplasm — where chemical reactions occur

**Address misconception:** "The nucleus is the brain of the cell" — the nucleus contains genetic instructions (DNA) but does not actively direct processes in real time the way a brain does.

**Differentiation:**
- *Support:* Teacher-prepared slides available as backup if pupils struggle
- *Stretch:* Compare your slide quality to the prepared slides from L2 — which gives a clearer image and why? (Thickness of specimen, staining quality, air bubbles)

**Plenary (7 min):** Quick-fire organelle function quiz (teacher calls organelle, pupils hold up whiteboard with function).

---

### Lesson 4 — Plant vs Animal Cells: Comparing Structures
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C029 (Plant vs animal cells), SC-KS3-C028 (Cell organelle functions)
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D002-CL002 (practice)
**Type:** Consolidation + comparison (CV001)
**Thinking Lens application:** "Why do plant cells have structures that animal cells do not? How does each structure enable the plant to function?"

**Learning objective:** Compare plant and animal cell structures and explain the function of organelles unique to plant cells.

**Starter — retrieval practice (5 min):** Unlabelled cell diagram on the board. Pupils label on whiteboards from memory. Check and self-correct.

**Main (35 min):**
- Side-by-side microscope observation: prepared onion cell slide next to cheek cell slide. List similarities and differences in a comparison table.
- Build the comparison using Structure and Function lens:

| Feature | Plant Cell | Animal Cell | WHY? (Structure and Function) |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| Cell wall | Present (cellulose) | Absent | Provides rigid support — plants don't have skeletons |
| Chloroplasts | Present (in leaf cells) | Absent | Site of photosynthesis — plants make their own food |
| Large vacuole | Present (permanent, filled with cell sap) | Small/temporary | Maintains turgor pressure — keeps plant upright |
| Cell membrane | Present | Present | Both need to control what enters/leaves |
| Nucleus | Present | Present | Both need DNA to control cell functions |
| Mitochondria | Present | Present | Both need to respire for energy |

- Address misconception: "Plant cells have no mitochondria because they have chloroplasts." Plants NEED mitochondria — they respire all the time. Chloroplasts only work in the light. At night, plants rely entirely on respiration.
- Address misconception: "Animal cells have no vacuoles." They CAN have small temporary vacuoles, but they lack the large permanent vacuole that maintains plant cell structure.

**Magnification calculation (10 min):**
- Teach the formula: magnification = image size / actual size
- Worked example: if a cell is drawn 3cm across but is actually 0.03mm (30 micrometres), magnification = 30mm / 0.03mm = x1000
- Practice problems (3-4 graded difficulty)

**Success criteria check (from CV001):**
- Can prepare a slide and focus at different magnifications? (L2-3)
- Can draw labelled scientific diagrams? (L2-3)
- Can calculate magnification? (L4)
- Can compare plant and animal cells? (L4)

**Plenary (5 min):** Exit ticket — name three differences between plant and animal cells and explain one using the Structure and Function lens.

### Lesson 5 — Checkpoint Assessment: Cells and Microscopy
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C026, SC-KS3-C027, SC-KS3-C028, SC-KS3-C029
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D002-CL001 + CL002 (assessment gate)
**Type:** Low-stakes written assessment (25 min) + review (25 min)

**Assessment structure:**
1. **Recall (6 marks):** Label a plant cell diagram; name three organelles and their functions
2. **Application (6 marks):** A pupil looks at a cell under the microscope and sees a cell wall, a large vacuole, and green chloroplasts. Is this a plant or animal cell? Explain your answer. Calculate the actual size of a cell from an image and magnification.
3. **Analysis (4 marks):** A student claims "root cells are not real plant cells because they don't have chloroplasts." Explain why this student is wrong. (Targets the misconception that all plant cells have chloroplasts.)
4. **Structure and Function (4 marks):** Explain why alveoli (lung cells) are thin and have a large surface area. Use the idea that structure is linked to function.

**After marking (teacher or peer-mark):**
- Class review of most common errors
- Misconception clinic: address any persistent issues before moving to hierarchy and diffusion

## WEEK 2: CELLS — Hierarchy, Diffusion and Specialisation

**Thinking Lens (primary):** Structure and Function (continuing) + Systems and System Models (transition lens for CL003-CL004)

### Lesson 6 — From Cells to Organisms: The Biological Hierarchy
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C032 (Biological hierarchy) [KEYSTONE]
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D002-CL002 (practice)
**Type:** New content

**Learning objective:** Describe the levels of organisation in multicellular organisms, from cells to tissues to organs to organ systems to the whole organism.

**Starter (5 min):** Show a photograph of a brick, a wall, a room, a house, a street. Ask: "How is a body like a street of houses?" Introduce the idea of hierarchy — small units building into larger structures.

**Main (35 min):**
- Build the hierarchy from the bottom up using the digestive system as the worked example:
  - **Cell:** epithelial cell (lining of the gut)
  - **Tissue:** epithelial tissue (sheet of epithelial cells)
  - **Organ:** stomach (made of epithelial tissue, muscle tissue, glandular tissue)
  - **Organ system:** digestive system (mouth, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, liver, pancreas)
  - **Organism:** the whole human

- Use the torso model to locate each organ of the digestive system physically
- Pupils create a hierarchy diagram (pyramid or flow chart) with examples at each level

**Address misconception:** "Organs and organ systems are the same thing." An organ is a SINGLE structure (the stomach). An organ system is a GROUP of organs working together (the digestive system).

**Address misconception:** "Tissues are made of identical cells." Some tissues contain more than one cell type working together (e.g., blood is a tissue containing red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and plasma).

**Differentiation:**
- *Support:* Card sort activity — sort examples into the five hierarchy levels
- *Stretch:* Name the four tissue types (epithelial, connective, muscle, nerve) and give an example of each

**Plenary (10 min):** Pupils write the hierarchy for a DIFFERENT system (e.g., respiratory system: alveolar cell -> lung tissue -> lung -> respiratory system -> organism). Share and compare.

**Key vocabulary:** cell, tissue, organ, organ system, organism, hierarchy, specialisation

---

### Lesson 7 — Cell Specialisation: Structure Enables Function
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C031 (Unicellular adaptations), SC-KS3-C032 (Biological hierarchy)
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D002-CL002 (practice)
**Type:** New content + application of Structure and Function lens

**Learning objective:** Explain how the structure of specialised cells is adapted to their function.

**Starter — Thinking Lens focus (5 min):** "If all cells have the same DNA, why don't they all look the same?" Introduce the idea that cells become specialised — their STRUCTURE is adapted to their FUNCTION.

**Main (35 min):**
- Present 6 specialised cells. For each, ask: "What is its job? How does its structure help it do that job?"

| Cell | Function | Structural Adaptations |
|------|----------|----------------------|
| Red blood cell | Carries oxygen | Biconcave disc (large SA), no nucleus (more room for haemoglobin) |
| Nerve cell | Transmits electrical signals | Very long (axon), branched endings (connections), myelin sheath (insulation) |
| Root hair cell | Absorbs water and minerals | Long hair-like extension (large SA), thin cell wall |
| Sperm cell | Reaches and fertilises egg | Streamlined head, acrosome (enzymes), tail (flagellum), many mitochondria |
| Palisade cell | Photosynthesis | Tall and packed with chloroplasts, near top of leaf for maximum light |
| White blood cell | Fights infection | Can change shape (engulf pathogens), produces antibodies |

- Unicellular organisms (from C031): Amoeba, Euglena, Paramecium — how does a SINGLE cell carry out all life processes? No specialisation, but adapted structures (pseudopodia, flagellum, cilia, contractile vacuole).

**Differentiation:**
- *Support:* Matching activity — match adaptation to function
- *Stretch:* Design a cell for a specific job (e.g., "a cell that lives in a very hot environment" — what structures would it need?)

**Plenary (10 min):** Pick one specialised cell. Write a 3-sentence explanation using the Structure and Function lens: "The [cell] has [structure] because this enables it to [function]."

---

### Lesson 8 — Diffusion: Particles on the Move (PRACTICAL)
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C030 (Diffusion) [KEYSTONE]
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D002-CL003 (practice)
**Type:** Practical — demonstration + pupil investigation
**WS Focus:** WS-KS3-003 (Designing controlled experiments), WS-KS3-005 (Presenting data)

**Learning objective:** Describe diffusion as the net movement of particles from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration, and explain it using the particle model.

**Safety briefing (3 min):**
- Potassium permanganate stains EVERYTHING — teacher handles crystals
- Agar cubes contain indicator — wash hands after handling
- No eating or drinking near chemicals

**Teacher demonstration — potassium permanganate (10 min):**
- Drop a single crystal of potassium permanganate into a beaker of still water at room temperature
- Pupils observe and sketch the spreading purple colour at 0, 2, 5, 10 minutes
- Set up a second beaker with warm water for comparison (temperature effect on diffusion rate)
- Ask: "Why does the colour spread? What is moving?"
- Introduce: particles move randomly. Net movement is from HIGH concentration to LOW concentration. This is diffusion.

**Pupil practical — agar cubes (surface area:volume) (20 min):**
- Agar cubes (with indicator) in different sizes: 1cm, 2cm, 3cm
- Place in acid solution and time how long for the colour to change throughout
- Record: cube size | time for complete colour change | surface area | volume | SA:V ratio
- Plot: cube size vs time
- Conclude: smaller cubes change faster because they have a higher surface area to volume ratio — more surface relative to their volume means faster diffusion

**Connecting to biology (10 min):**
- Why are cells small? Because they need a high SA:V ratio for diffusion of oxygen, nutrients, and waste
- Where does diffusion happen in the body? Lungs (O2 in, CO2 out), gut (nutrients into blood), kidneys (waste out)
- Cross-domain link (from CO_TEACHES): diffusion is the SAME concept in biology, chemistry (SC-KS3-C078), and physics (SC-KS3-C161). Different contexts, same particle model.

**Address misconception:** "Particles move from high to low concentration on purpose." Particles move RANDOMLY in all directions. The NET movement is from high to low because there are more particles to move away from the concentrated area.

**Plenary (7 min):** Draw a particle diagram showing diffusion of oxygen into a cell. Label: high concentration, low concentration, direction of net movement, cell membrane.

---

### Lesson 9 — Diffusion in Living Systems: Application
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C030 (Diffusion), SC-KS3-C043 (Gas exchange system structure)
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D002-CL003 + CL007 (bridging lesson)
**Type:** Application + extension
**Thinking Lens transition:** Begin shifting from "Structure and Function" toward "Systems and System Models" — how do these structures work together as a SYSTEM?

**Learning objective:** Explain how diffusion enables gas exchange in the lungs and nutrient absorption in the gut.

**Starter (5 min):** Retrieval — define diffusion and draw a particle diagram from memory.

**Main (35 min):**
- **Gas exchange in the lungs:** Alveoli structure (Structure and Function lens)
  - Huge surface area (300 million alveoli = 70 square metres)
  - Walls one cell thick (short diffusion distance)
  - Rich blood supply (maintains concentration gradient)
  - Moist surface (gases dissolve before diffusing)
  - O2 diffuses into blood, CO2 diffuses out — both moving from high to low concentration

- **Nutrient absorption in the gut:** Villi structure
  - Finger-like projections increase surface area
  - One cell thick wall
  - Rich blood supply (carries nutrients away, maintaining gradient)

- **Systems thinking:** These are not isolated structures. The respiratory and circulatory systems INTERACT — the blood carries oxygen from the lungs to the cells and CO2 from the cells to the lungs. Start mapping the system: lungs <-> blood <-> cells.

**Address misconception:** "We breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide." Expired air still contains approximately 16% oxygen. We breathe out a MIXTURE, with more CO2 and less O2 than what we breathed in.

**Differentiation:**
- *Support:* Annotate a pre-drawn alveolus diagram with labels and arrows
- *Stretch:* Why do emphysema sufferers struggle with gas exchange? (Destroyed alveoli = reduced SA = less diffusion = less O2 reaching blood)

**Plenary (10 min):** "Explain why alveoli are adapted for efficient gas exchange" — write a paragraph using these sentence starters: "Alveoli have... because this..." (applying Structure and Function).

---

### Lesson 10 — Review and Consolidation: Cells Unit
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C026, C027, C028, C029, C030, C031, C032
**Cluster:** D002-CL001 through CL003 (consolidation)
**Type:** Retrieval practice + gap-filling

**Learning objective:** Consolidate understanding of cell structure, microscopy, hierarchy, specialisation, and diffusion before transitioning to ecosystems.

**Carousel activity (40 min — 8 min per station):**
1. **Microscope station:** Identify cells on prepared slides (no labels). Record what you see.
2. **Magnification station:** Calculate actual size from image size and magnification (3 problems, graded difficulty)
3. **Hierarchy station:** Sort 20 cards into the five levels of organisation. Identify which organ system each example belongs to.
4. **Specialisation station:** Match 6 specialised cells to their functions and explain one adaptation using Structure and Function.
5. **Diffusion station:** Predict what would happen to the rate of diffusion if (a) temperature increased, (b) surface area decreased, (c) concentration gradient increased. Explain using particle model.

**Plenary (10 min):** Traffic light self-assessment against the CV001 success criteria:
- Prepare a microscope slide and achieve focus at different magnifications
- Draw labelled scientific diagrams following conventions
- Calculate magnification using the formula
- Compare plant and animal cells, identifying key structural differences

Identify any amber/red areas for targeted intervention.

## WEEK 3: ECOSYSTEMS — Interdependence, Food Webs and Fieldwork

**Thinking Lens (primary):** Systems and System Models — "What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?"
**Secondary lens:** Stability and Change — "What keeps this stable, what causes change, and how quickly does change happen?"

**Content Vehicle:** SC-KS3-CV006 (Ecosystem Relationships)

### Lesson 11 — What is an Ecosystem? Parts of the System
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C057 (Ecosystem interdependence) [KEYSTONE]
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D004-CL001 (introduction)
**Type:** New content

**Learning objective:** Define an ecosystem and identify its biotic and abiotic components.

**Thinking Lens starter (5 min):** Show a photograph of a woodland. Ask: "What are ALL the parts of this system?" List as many as possible on the board. Then categorise: which are living (biotic) and which are non-living (abiotic)?

**Main (35 min):**
- Define ecosystem: a community of living organisms interacting with each other AND their non-living environment
- Biotic factors: producers (plants), consumers (animals), decomposers (fungi, bacteria), predators, prey
- Abiotic factors: light, temperature, water, minerals, soil pH, wind
- Introduce interdependence: organisms DEPEND on each other. Plants depend on bees for pollination. Bees depend on plants for nectar. Decomposers depend on dead organisms. Plants depend on decomposers to recycle nutrients back to the soil.
- "Jenga tower" analogy: remove one species and the whole system can become unstable

**Systems thinking application:**
- Map a woodland ecosystem as a system diagram: identify inputs (sunlight, rain), outputs (O2, CO2), components (producers, consumers, decomposers), and interactions (feeding, pollination, decomposition)
- Ask: "What would happen if all the decomposers were removed?" Trace the effects through the system.

**Key vocabulary (from CV006):** ecosystem, habitat, food web, producer, consumer, decomposer, predator, prey, interdependence, biodiversity

**Differentiation:**
- *Support:* Pre-drawn system diagram — pupils add labels and arrows
- *Stretch:* Can you identify any FEEDBACK loops? (e.g., more plants -> more herbivores -> more plants eaten -> fewer plants -> fewer herbivores -> plants recover...)

**Plenary (10 min):** Exit ticket — "Name three biotic factors and three abiotic factors in a pond ecosystem. Explain one example of interdependence."

---

### Lesson 12 — Fieldwork Day 1: Quadrat Sampling (PRACTICAL — OUTDOOR)
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C057 (Ecosystem interdependence), SC-KS3-C058 (Food webs)
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D004-CL001 (introduction)
**Type:** Practical fieldwork — observation enquiry (CV006)
**WS Focus:** WS-KS3-002 (Making observations), WS-KS3-003 (Systematic enquiry), WS-KS3-005 (Recording data)

**Learning objective:** Use quadrats to sample species in two contrasting habitats and record data systematically.

**Pre-lesson:**
- Outdoor fieldwork risk assessment completed and signed
- Check weather — rain plan: sample under covered areas or postpone to L13
- Allergy check for class (grass, pollen, insect stings)
- Remind: wash hands thoroughly after handling soil/organisms

**Safety briefing (5 min):**
- Stay within designated areas (school grounds boundaries marked)
- Do not eat anything found outdoors
- Handle organisms gently — return invertebrates to where you found them
- Wash hands immediately after fieldwork
- Report any cuts or insect stings to teacher

**Fieldwork method (from CV006 — 40 min):**
1. Select two contrasting habitats: (a) sunny open area, (b) shaded area under trees
2. In each habitat, lay a 10m transect line using tape measure
3. Place quadrat at 5 random points along the transect (use random number generator for placement)
4. In each quadrat: identify and count ALL plant species using the identification key
5. Record in a tally table: Species | Quadrat 1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Q5 | Total

**Recording format (from CV006):** Species tally table -> bar chart of distribution

**Equipment per group (from CV006):** quadrats, identification keys, tally counters, tape measures, clipboards

**Back in classroom (5 min):** Secure data. Check all equipment returned. Antibacterial gel.

**Homework:** Calculate the mean number of each species per quadrat for each habitat. Begin bar chart.

### Lesson 13 — Fieldwork Day 2: Data Analysis and Food Webs
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C058 (Food webs), SC-KS3-C057 (Ecosystem interdependence)
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D004-CL001 (introduction)
**Type:** Data analysis + food web construction
**WS Focus:** WS-KS3-005 (Presenting data), WS-KS3-006 (Interpreting data)

**Learning objective:** Construct a food web from fieldwork data and explain feeding relationships.

**Starter (5 min):** Display the class data from L12 in a combined table. "What patterns can you see? Which species were more common in the shaded habitat? The sunny one? Why?"

**Main — Part 1: Data analysis (15 min):**
- Complete bar charts comparing species distribution in sunny vs shaded habitats
- Discuss: why are some species found in one habitat but not the other? (Link abiotic factors — light, moisture — to species distribution)
- Introduce the idea that the habitat determines which species can survive there

**Main — Part 2: Building food webs (25 min):**
- Provide a list of organisms found in the school grounds + additional organisms for a complete web (e.g., oak tree, grass, daisy, caterpillar, slug, blackbird, sparrowhawk, earthworm, fungi)
- Start with simple food chains: grass -> slug -> blackbird
- Then connect multiple chains into a food web
- Label trophic levels: producer (T1), primary consumer (T2), secondary consumer (T3), tertiary consumer (T4)
- Energy transfer: approximately 10% passes to the next trophic level

**Address misconception:** "Arrows in food chains show who eats who." The arrows show the direction of ENERGY TRANSFER — from the organism being eaten TO the one eating it.

**Systems thinking application:** "What would happen if we removed all the blackbirds from this food web?" Trace the effects: slugs increase (no predator), plants decrease (more slugs eating them), sparrowhawk must find other prey or starve. One change cascades through the entire system.

**Differentiation:**
- *Support:* Food web template with organisms pre-placed — pupils draw the arrows
- *Stretch:* Calculate energy at each trophic level. If producers capture 10,000 kJ, how much reaches the tertiary consumer? (10,000 -> 1,000 -> 100 -> 10 kJ)

**Plenary (5 min):** Quick-fire: "Name the producer / Name a primary consumer / Name a secondary consumer / What is interdependence?"

**Success criteria check (from CV006):**
- Use quadrats to collect data on species distribution (L12)
- Construct a food web from collected data (L13)
- Explain the concept of interdependence with examples (L11, L13)
- Predict the effects of an environmental change on an ecosystem (L13, L14)

### Lesson 14 — Environmental Change: What Happens When Systems Are Disrupted?
**Concepts:** SC-KS3-C060 (Environmental interactions), SC-KS3-C059 (Pollination and food security)
**Cluster:** SC-KS3-D004-CL002 + CL003 (practice)
**Type:** New content + discussion
**Thinking Lens:** Stability and Change — "What keeps this ecosystem stable, and what would tip it into change?"

**Learning objective:** Explain how environmental changes affect organisms and ecosystems, and evaluate the importance of pollinators for food security.

**Starter (5 min):** Show two images of the same location: (1) a healthy coral reef, (2) a bleached coral reef. "What has changed? What caused it? What are the consequences?"

**Main — Part 1: Environmental interactions (20 min):**
- Organisms affect their environment: earthworms improve soil, beavers build dams, plants change soil chemistry
- Environment affects organisms: acid rain damages forests, temperature changes migration patterns, pollution reduces populations
- Human impacts: deforestation, pollution, urbanisation, introduction of invasive species
- Data analysis: provide a dataset showing population changes after an environmental event (e.g., removal of wolves from Yellowstone — trophic cascade). Pupils interpret the data using the Systems lens.

**Main — Part 2: Pollinators and food security (15 min):**
- 75% of globally important food crops benefit from insect pollination
- Pollinator decline: colony collapse disorder, habitat loss, pesticide use
- Challenge: "Go through your lunch today. Which items required insect pollination?" (Apples, strawberries, tomatoes = yes. Bread, rice = no — wind-pollinated)
- Connect to biodiversity (SC-KS3-C067): loss of pollinators threatens food security

**Address misconception:** "Only bees pollinate." Butterflies, moths, hoverflies, beetles, and even bats pollinate. And wind-pollinated crops (wheat, rice, corn) do NOT depend on insects.

**Stability and Change lens application:** "The pollinator population has been stable for millions of years. What has tipped it into change? How fast is the change happening? Is it reversible?"

**Differentiation:**
- *Support:* Structured cause-and-effect chain diagram (change -> immediate effect -> knock-on effect -> ecosystem impact)
- *Stretch:* Evaluate two conservation strategies: "rewilding" vs "captive breeding programmes" — which is more effective for ecosystem stability and why?

**Plenary (10 min):** Write three sentences using this frame: "If [environmental change] happens, then [organism/population] will be affected because [reason], which will lead to [knock-on effect in the ecosystem]."

### Lesson 15 — End-of-Unit Assessment: Cells and Ecosystems
**Concepts:** All unit concepts (C026-C032, C057-C060)
**Type:** Summative assessment (35 min) + reflection (15 min)

**Assessment structure:**

**Section A — Cells (12 marks):**
1. Label a plant cell diagram (4 marks)
2. A pupil calculates the magnification of a microscope as x400. The eyepiece is x10. What is the magnification of the objective lens? (1 mark)
3. Describe two differences between plant and animal cells. For each, explain how the structure helps the cell function. (4 marks) [Structure and Function lens]
4. Explain why diffusion is important for gas exchange in the lungs. Use ideas about concentration gradient and surface area. (3 marks)

**Section B — Ecosystems (12 marks):**
5. Define "ecosystem" and name two biotic and two abiotic factors. (3 marks)
6. Use the food web provided to answer: (a) Name a secondary consumer. (b) What would happen to the rabbit population if foxes were removed? Explain your answer. (c) What would happen to the grass population as a result? (4 marks) [Systems lens]
7. Explain why the decline in bee populations is a threat to human food security. (3 marks)
8. A factory starts releasing warm water into a river. Predict and explain the effects on the river ecosystem. Use ideas about interdependence. (2 marks) [Stability and Change lens]

**Section C — Thinking scientifically (6 marks):**
9. A student says: "Root cells are not real plant cells because they do not have chloroplasts." Is this student correct? Explain your answer. (2 marks)
10. Describe how you would use quadrats to compare plant species in two different habitats. Include how you would make your results reliable. (4 marks)

**Total: 30 marks**

**Reflection (15 min after assessment):**
- Traffic light self-assessment against all success criteria (CV001 + CV006)
- "What did you find most challenging in this unit? What are you most confident about?"
- Preview of next unit (note: could be human body systems, building on biological hierarchy from L6)
