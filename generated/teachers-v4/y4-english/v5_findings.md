## 1. What Has Improved Since V4

### Content Vehicles: My Critical Gap Addressed

In my v4 review, I wrote: "You cannot teach English without texts. An English lesson without a text is not a lesson." I rated the graph 4/10 for content generation readiness. My primary demand was: add a text/resource layer -- "even minimal: genre recommendations per cluster, suggested text types, example text characteristics."

The Content Vehicle layer does not just meet this demand. It exceeds it. Here is what I now have for Year 4 English:

**8 Content Vehicles across 5 domains:**
- EN-Y4-CV001: Adventure Narrative -- The Iron Man (text_study)
- EN-Y4-CV002: Myths and Legends -- Greek Myths (text_study)
- EN-Y4-CV003: Persuasive Writing -- Save Our Park (text_study)
- EN-Y4-CV004: Poetry -- Performance and Form (text_study)
- EN-Y4-CV005: Information Text -- Non-Chronological Report (text_study)
- EN-Y4-CV006: Fairy Tales -- Rewriting the Classics (text_study)
- EN-Y4-CV007: Spelling and Vocabulary -- Word Detective (text_study)
- EN-Y4-CV008: Discussion and Debate -- Should Animals Be Kept in Zoos? (text_study)

Each vehicle provides exactly the data I said was missing:
| My v4 complaint | What the vehicle provides | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| No texts | `suggested_texts` with specific titles and authors | Addressed |
| No genre features | `genre` field per vehicle (adventure narrative, myth, persuasive letter, etc.) | Addressed |
| Grammar disconnected from text study | `grammar_focus` linking specific grammar concepts to the vehicle | Addressed |
| No reading level guidance | Word count range on writing outcome; Lexile in learner profile | Partially addressed (see gaps below) |
| No writing outcome specifications | `writing_outcome` with word count, genre, and structural requirements | Addressed |

In addition, the vehicles provide data I did not ask for but which is extremely useful:
- **Assessment guidance** per vehicle: "Can pupils identify the problem-resolution structure?" -- these translate directly into teacher assessment questions
- **Success criteria** per vehicle: four clear, specific criteria that children can self-assess against
- **Key vocabulary** per vehicle: genre-specific terminology, not just generic literacy vocabulary
- **DELIVERS relationships**: explicit mapping from vehicle to concepts, so I can see exactly which concepts each unit covers

This is a transformative improvement. The graph has gone from "brilliant skeleton with a blank space where the text should be" to "a planning tool I would actually use."

### Thinking Lenses: Cognitive Framing Done Right

The Thinking Lenses were not something I asked for. They are a bonus -- and a good one.

Each cluster now has 1-2 Thinking Lenses assigned with:
- A **key question** (e.g., "What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?")
- A **rationale** explaining why this lens fits this specific cluster (not a generic justification)
- An **AI instruction** for how to apply the lens in teaching

For Year 4 English, the dominant lenses are:
- **Evidence and Argument** -- for inference, justifying views, evaluating writing
- **Perspective and Interpretation** -- for literary themes, comparing texts, authorial purpose
- **Structure and Function** -- for composition planning, narrative structure, organisational devices
- **Patterns** -- for grammar rules, spelling patterns, genre conventions

These are sensible assignments. Evidence and Argument for reading comprehension clusters is exactly right -- inference and justification are fundamentally evidence-based. Perspective and Interpretation for literary themes is exactly right -- understanding different viewpoints is central to reading fiction. Structure and Function for composition is exactly right -- understanding why a text is structured the way it is underpins both reading and writing.

In practice (see my teaching log), the lens key questions worked well when translated into Year 4 language. "What is the evidence?" became "What in the book tells you that?" "Whose perspective is this?" became "Whose side of the story are we hearing?" The lenses gave my reading lessons a consistent cognitive framework that elevated the quality of discussion.

### Reading-Writing Connections Strengthened

The v4 graph already had strong cross-domain CO_TEACHES relationships between Reading Comprehension and Writing Composition. The vehicles strengthen these further because each vehicle explicitly bridges reading and writing:

- EN-Y4-CV001 delivers both reading concepts (C016, C017, C019, C026, C027) and writing concepts (C046). The vehicle is the text study that generates both the comprehension teaching and the writing model.
- The grammar focus in each vehicle connects grammar concepts from D007 to the composition work, solving my v4 complaint about "grammar disconnected from text study."

This means the three-domain integration (reading, writing, grammar) is now modelled at the vehicle level. This is how English actually works in a classroom: you read *The Iron Man*, you study fronted adverbials in Hughes's sentences, you write your own adventure narrative using fronted adverbials. The vehicle holds all three together.

### Cross-Subject Links

The cross-domain CO_TEACHES relationships have expanded since v4. I now see:
- EN-Y4-C026 (Drawing inferences) links to HI-KS3-C004 (Constructing Historical Arguments) -- labelled "Okonkwo + Adeyemi"
- EN-Y4-C030 (Retrieving from non-fiction) links to SC-KS2-C030 (Environmental Change) and SC-KS2-C066 (Evolution)
- EN-Y4-C003 (Vocabulary building) links to SC-KS2-C048 (Dissolving and Solutions)
- EN-Y4-C047 (Organisational devices) links to HI-KS3-C004 (Constructing Historical Arguments)

These are exactly the cross-curricular connections I asked for in v4. They are labelled with my name in the rationale, which means someone has listened to my feedback. The rationales are specific and pedagogically accurate: "English vocabulary building strategies (Latin/Greek roots, prefixes, suffixes) directly support science technical vocabulary." Yes. Correct.

However, the cross-subject links are still thin -- 4 connections for the most cross-curricular subject in the primary curriculum. More on this in gaps below.

## 2. Updated Rating

### Structure: 8/10 (previously 7/10)

The structural improvement comes from Content Vehicles and Thinking Lenses adding two new data layers that were previously absent. The graph now has:
- Complete concept coverage (unchanged -- already strong)
- Prerequisite chains (unchanged -- already strong)
- Cross-domain reading-writing connections (improved -- now reinforced by vehicles)
- Cross-subject links (improved -- 4 connections, was 0)
- Text recommendations per unit (new -- via vehicles)
- Genre taxonomy embedded in vehicles (new)
- Writing outcomes specified (new)
- Cognitive framing per cluster (new -- via Thinking Lenses)
- Grammar-in-context mapping (new -- via vehicle grammar_focus)

What keeps it from 9: see structural gaps below (still no reading assessment content domains mapped to concepts, spoken language still disconnected, handwriting still present but AI-non-deliverable).

### Content Generation Readiness: 7/10 (previously 4/10)

This is a major improvement. The jump from 4 to 7 reflects the addition of texts, genres, grammar focus, writing outcomes, and success criteria -- all of which are essential for generating English lessons.

An AI system could now:
- Generate a reading comprehension lesson for *The Iron Man* targeting EN-Y4-C026, using the vehicle's suggested text, assessment guidance, and the Evidence and Argument Thinking Lens question
- Generate a writing task for an adventure narrative using the vehicle's writing outcome (500-700 words), grammar focus (fronted adverbials, expanded noun phrases, direct speech), and success criteria
- Generate a grammar activity on fronted adverbials in the context of Hughes's sentences, connecting reading analysis to writing application
- Generate assessment questions aligned to the success criteria
- Frame all activities using the appropriate Thinking Lens key question

Previously, the AI could only generate the skill framework ("teach inference") but not the content ("using Chapter 3 of The Iron Man"). Now it can generate both. This is the difference between a curriculum map and a teaching resource.

What keeps it from 8: see content generation gaps below.

### Combined Score: 7.5/10 (previously average of 5.5/10)

---

## 3. Remaining Gaps

### GAP 1 (Previously CRITICAL, now SIGNIFICANT): Reading comprehension content domain codes still not mapped

My v4 review flagged this: the KS2 Reading SAT uses content domains (2a-2h) that are not mapped to the reading comprehension concepts. The grammar/punctuation domain has 11 content domain codes mapped (G1.4, G1.5, G3.2, etc.). Reading comprehension has zero.

This matters because:
- Teachers need to generate reading assessment papers that target specific content domains
- The Reading Skills (RS-KS2-2a through RS-KS2-2h) are in the epistemic skills layer but are not linked to the assessment layer's content domain codes
- An AI generating test-preparation materials for KS2 Reading cannot target specific domains without this mapping

**Recommendation:** Map the reading content domains to D003 comprehension concepts. This is a straightforward structural addition -- the concepts already exist, the content domains already exist in the epistemic skills layer. They just need connecting through the assessment layer.

### GAP 2 (SIGNIFICANT): Reading level per text not specified in vehicles

The vehicles specify `suggested_texts` but not a reading level per text. The learner profile gives a Lexile range (300-500 for KS2/Y4) and the writing outcome gives a word count range. But I cannot tell from the vehicle data whether *The Iron Man* is at the right reading level for Year 4 children.

In practice, *The Iron Man* has a Lexile of approximately 780L -- significantly above the Year 4 Lexile range of 300-500. This is appropriate for a teacher read-aloud text (children's listening comprehension exceeds their reading comprehension at this age), but the graph does not distinguish between texts for independent reading and texts for shared/teacher-led reading.

**Recommendation:** Add a `reading_level` or `lexile` property to each suggested text in the vehicle data. Alternatively, add a `reading_mode` property: "independent" (within child's Lexile range), "guided" (slightly above), "shared" (significantly above, teacher-led). This would allow an AI to select appropriate texts for different contexts.

### GAP 3 (SIGNIFICANT): No model text content

The vehicles recommend texts (e.g., "The Iron Man by Ted Hughes") but do not contain or link to the text content itself. This means:
- An AI cannot generate a comprehension passage from the recommended text without access to a separate text library
- An AI cannot generate questions about a specific chapter without knowing what happens in that chapter
- Children working on the AI platform would need a physical copy of the book

This is likely a deliberate architectural decision (copyright, licensing). But it limits content generation for reading comprehension activities to either: (a) the AI generates original passages in the style of the text, or (b) the AI accesses a licensed text library.

**Recommendation:** For each vehicle, add a `text_summary` or `chapter_synopsis` property that summarises the key events, characters, and themes per chapter. This avoids copyright issues while giving an AI enough information to generate questions, discussion prompts, and writing tasks about the text. For shorter texts (poems, model letters), the full text could potentially be included.

### GAP 4 (SIGNIFICANT): Vocabulary progression absent

My v4 review flagged the absence of vocabulary progression -- Tier 2 academic vocabulary banks, subject-specific vocabulary per topic, vocabulary grouped by text type. This has not been addressed.

The vehicles include `key_vocabulary` per vehicle, which is a step forward. But these are genre-specific terminology lists (narrative, protagonist, antagonist, setting, climax, resolution, suspense, dialogue), not the broader academic vocabulary that children need to build across the year.

**Recommendation:** Add Tier 2 vocabulary banks per half-term or per vehicle, aligned to cross-curricular themes. For example, the Iron Man vehicle could include: observation, destruction, enormous, investigate, mysterious, challenge -- words that are useful across English, science, and geography.

### GAP 5 (MODERATE): Spoken language still disconnected

My v4 review noted that Spoken Language (D001) has no CO_TEACHES links to other English domains. This is still the case. The only cross-domain connection for D001 is through EN-Y4-CV008 (Discussion and Debate: Should Animals Be Kept in Zoos?), which delivers both spoken language concepts (C001, C004, C006, C007, C011) and composition concepts (C042, C045). This is a vehicle-level connection, which is useful, but the underlying graph still treats spoken language as a separate domain.

In practice, spoken language underpins everything. Discussion improves comprehension. Oral rehearsal improves writing. Drama improves inference. The cross-domain CO_TEACHES link between EN-Y4-C021 (Poetry and play performance) and EN-Y4-C044 (Oral rehearsal) partially addresses this, but it is a reading-to-writing link, not a spoken-language-to-reading/writing link.

**Recommendation:** Add CO_TEACHES links from D001 spoken language concepts to D003 and D006 concepts. For example: EN-Y4-C004 (Articulating and justifying opinions) should CO_TEACH with EN-Y4-C064 (Justifying views about reading independently) -- they are the same skill in different modalities.

### GAP 6 (MODERATE): Vehicle coverage is not complete

The 8 vehicles cover the majority of Year 4 English concepts, but there are gaps:
- EN-Y4-C065 (Silent reading with understanding) is not delivered by any vehicle
- EN-Y4-C021 (Poetry and play performance) is delivered only by EN-Y4-CV004 -- no second option
- EN-Y4-C025 (Questions to improve comprehension) is not explicitly delivered by any vehicle
- EN-Y4-C028 (Summarising main ideas) is delivered only by EN-Y4-CV002 -- limited coverage
- The entire Handwriting domain (D005) has no vehicle, which is appropriate given it is a motor skill

Additionally, the vehicles are all classified as `text_study`. English could benefit from other vehicle types:
- `investigation` type for grammar investigation activities
- `worked_example_set` for spelling and punctuation modelling

**Recommendation:** Audit vehicle-to-concept coverage and ensure every concept is delivered by at least one vehicle. Add a second vehicle option for concepts currently covered by only one vehicle, to give teachers genuine choice.

### GAP 7 (LOW): Cross-subject links still thin for English

Four cross-subject CO_TEACHES links is better than zero (the v4 state), but English in primary schools connects to every subject. The current links are:
- English to Science (2 links -- retrieval skills to science topics)
- English to History (2 links -- inference to historical arguments, composition to historical arguments)
- English to Geography: 0
- English to RE: 0
- English to Art/DT: 0

**Recommendation:** This is a long-term enrichment task, not an urgent structural gap. The priority should be Geography links (English retrieval skills to geography place knowledge) and RE/PSHE links (English discussion and debate to moral/ethical questions).

---

## 4. Recommendations (Priority Order)

1. **Map KS2 Reading content domain codes to D003 concepts** -- This was my second priority in v4 and remains the most important structural gap. The reading content domains (2a-2h) map directly to comprehension concepts. This would unlock assessment generation for reading.

2. **Add reading level/mode per suggested text** -- Even a simple "independent / guided / shared" tag per text would significantly improve content generation for reading activities. Lexile per text would be ideal.

3. **Add text summaries per vehicle** -- Chapter synopses or text overviews (non-copyrighted) would allow an AI to generate text-specific questions and discussion prompts without accessing the full text.

4. **Audit and close vehicle-to-concept coverage gaps** -- Ensure every EN-Y4 concept is delivered by at least one vehicle, and ideally by two to give teachers choice.

5. **Add spoken language cross-domain links** -- Connect D001 concepts to the reading and writing concepts they directly support. This is a low-effort, high-value structural improvement.

6. **Add Tier 2 vocabulary progression** -- Per vehicle or per half-term, aligned to cross-curricular themes. This supports both reading comprehension and writing quality.

7. **Add child-facing Thinking Lens questions** -- The current key questions are pitched at the teacher/platform level. A simplified version per lens ("What clues can you find?" instead of "What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?") would make the lenses more directly usable in AI interactions with children.

## 5. Content Vehicle Quality Evaluation

### Are the suggested texts appropriate for Year 4 English?

| Vehicle | Suggested texts | Age-appropriate? | Curricular fit? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| EN-Y4-CV001 | The Iron Man (Ted Hughes), Stig of the Dump (Clive King) | Yes -- both are established Y4 texts | Excellent -- adventure narrative with strong themes | The Iron Man is a standard Y3-4 class reader. Stig of the Dump is excellent for comparison. |
| EN-Y4-CV002 | Greek Myths (Marcia Williams), Atticus the Storyteller (Lucy Coats), Who Let the Gods Out? (Maz Evans) | Yes | Good -- range from traditional retellings to contemporary fiction inspired by myths | Williams is picture-book format -- may be too simple for some Y4 readers. Coats is a better independent read. Evans is strong but is a novel, not a collection -- different from the others. |
| EN-Y4-CV003 | Model persuasive letters (teacher-curated), Newspaper opinion columns (adapted) | Depends on curation | Good in principle | "Teacher-curated" and "adapted" are not specific enough. An AI cannot access these. This vehicle needs more concrete text recommendations. |
| EN-Y4-CV004 | The Works (ed. Cookson), A Great Big Cuddle (Michael Rosen), Revolting Rhymes (Roald Dahl) | Partially | Good range | A Great Big Cuddle is for ages 0-5 -- it is Rosen's picture book collection for very young children. This is an error. For Y4 poetry, Rosen's *Quick Let's Get Out of Here* or *Wouldn't You Like to Know* are more appropriate. Revolting Rhymes is narrative poetry in verse form -- great for Y4. The Works is an excellent anthology. |
| EN-Y4-CV005 | DK Eyewitness books, National Geographic Kids articles | Yes | Good | These are generic recommendations rather than specific titles. Adequate for non-fiction, but a specific DK title linked to a Y4 cross-curricular topic would be better. |
| EN-Y4-CV006 | The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs (Scieszka), Revolting Rhymes (Dahl), Traditional tales collection | Yes | Excellent | Scieszka is perfect for fairy tale retelling. Revolting Rhymes appears in both CV004 and CV006, which is fine -- it serves both poetry and fairy tale units. |
| EN-Y4-CV007 | Y3-4 statutory word list, Etymological dictionaries (child-friendly) | Yes | Appropriate | Not really "texts" in the literary sense, but appropriate for a spelling/vocabulary vehicle. |
| EN-Y4-CV008 | Should There Be Zoos? (Tony Stead), Newspaper debate articles (adapted) | Yes | Good | Stead is a good choice for balanced discussion text. "Adapted" newspaper articles again need more specificity for AI use. |

### Error flagged

**EN-Y4-CV004 -- A Great Big Cuddle by Michael Rosen** is categorised as a suggested text for Y4 poetry. This is a picture book for babies and toddlers (ages 0-5). It contains action rhymes and baby songs. It is wildly inappropriate for Year 4 children and would undermine the seriousness of the poetry unit. Replace with *Quick Let's Get Out of Here* (Michael Rosen, 1983) or *Michael Rosen's Big Book of Bad Things* (2010), both of which are age-appropriate for Y4 and showcase Rosen's free verse style that is relevant to the curriculum.

### Are the genre features appropriate?

The genre classifications are accurate: adventure narrative, myth and legend, persuasive letter, poetry, non-chronological report, fairy tale retelling, balanced discussion text. These cover the core non-fiction and fiction text types expected at Year 4. Missing genres:
- **Diary / recount** (commonly taught in Y4, often linked to history topics)
- **Explanation text** (how/why something works -- commonly taught linked to science)
- **Play script** (EN-Y4-C021 mentions play scripts but no vehicle delivers this genre)

### Are the grammar focus areas appropriate?

| Vehicle | Grammar focus | Appropriate for Y4? | Connected to text? |
|---|---|---|---|
| CV001 | Fronted adverbials, expanded noun phrases, direct speech punctuation | Yes -- all statutory Y4 grammar | Yes -- Hughes uses all three extensively |
| CV002 | Conjunctions for time and cause, pronoun choice for cohesion, present perfect tense | Yes | Reasonable -- myths use time connectives and cohesion |
| CV003 | Multi-clause sentences, fronted adverbials, paragraphs around a theme | Yes | Yes -- persuasive writing requires complex sentences and paragraphing |
| CV004 | Figurative language and academic vocabulary, expanded noun phrases | Yes | Yes -- poetry is the natural context for figurative language |
| CV005 | Paragraphs around a theme, expanded noun phrases, Standard English verb inflections | Mostly yes | Standard English verb inflections feel forced in a non-fiction report context -- this is better taught in a spoken language or narrative context |
| CV006 | Direct speech punctuation, fronted adverbials, pronoun choice for cohesion | Yes | Yes -- fairy tale retelling uses dialogue and narrative cohesion |
| CV007 | Prefixes and suffixes, suffix doubling, homophones | Yes | Yes -- spelling vehicle, grammar focus is on spelling rules |
| CV008 | Conjunctions/adverbs/prepositions for time and cause, paragraphs, multi-clause sentences | Yes | Yes -- balanced discussion requires these connectives |

One concern: fronted adverbials appear in three vehicles (CV001, CV003, CV006). This is good for spiral revision but means other grammar concepts get less vehicle coverage. Standard English verb inflections (EN-Y4-C060) appear in only one vehicle (CV005), and present perfect tense (EN-Y4-C053) appears in only one vehicle (CV002). These are assessed in the KS2 grammar test (G4.1b and G7.1 respectively) and need more coverage.

### Are the writing outcomes appropriate?

| Vehicle | Writing outcome | Word count | Appropriate? |
|---|---|---|---|
| CV001 | Adventure narrative with problem-resolution structure, vivid description, dialogue | 500-700 | Yes -- ambitious but achievable for Y4 extended writing |
| CV002 | Myth retelling with key features and vivid description | 400-600 | Yes |
| CV003 | Persuasive letter with formal structure and rhetorical devices | 300-500 | Yes -- slightly short for a Y4 extended piece but appropriate for formal letter |
| CV004 | Poems in at least 2 forms + performance | N/A | Appropriate -- poetry is measured differently |
| CV005 | Non-chronological report with subheadings and diagrams | 400-600 | Yes |
| CV006 | Fairy tale retelling with a twist | 500-700 | Yes |
| CV007 | Spelling log with word families and corrections | N/A | Appropriate -- not traditional writing |
| CV008 | Balanced discussion text with justified conclusion | 400-600 | Yes |

The word counts are sensible. 500-700 words is a challenging but realistic target for Year 4 extended narrative writing (2-3 pages of A4). 300-500 for a formal letter is appropriate.

### Assessment guidance quality

The assessment guidance and success criteria per vehicle are well-structured. Each vehicle has:
- 3-4 assessment questions (framed as "Can pupils...?")
- 4 success criteria (specific, observable, assessable)

These translate directly into:
- Teacher assessment checklists
- Self-assessment criteria for children
- AI-generated formative assessment questions

This is a genuine strength of the vehicle layer. Having assessment baked into the vehicle means that every unit has built-in assessment from the start.

---

## Summary Verdict

The graph has changed substantially since my v4 review. The addition of Content Vehicles addresses my most critical complaint -- the absence of texts -- and does so with sufficient detail (suggested texts, genre, grammar focus, writing outcomes, success criteria, assessment guidance) to be genuinely useful for planning and for content generation.

The Thinking Lenses add a cognitive framing layer that I did not ask for but that elevates the quality of teaching and learning when used well. The lens key questions gave my lessons a consistent intellectual framework, and the per-cluster rationales explain why each lens was chosen, which helps me understand and adapt the framing rather than following it blindly.

The graph is no longer just a curriculum reference tool. It is approaching a planning tool. An AI with access to this graph data could now generate English lessons that include specific texts, genre-appropriate writing tasks, grammar in context, and assessment criteria. That was not possible with v4.

The remaining gaps -- reading assessment content domains, reading level per text, text summaries, vocabulary progression, spoken language cross-domain links -- are significant but solvable. None of them are structural redesign issues. They are data enrichment tasks.

**Score: 8/10 for curriculum structure. 7/10 for content generation readiness.**

The path to 9/10: add reading content domain codes, reading levels per text, and text summaries. The path to 8/10 for content generation: fix the Rosen book error, add model text content or summaries, and close the vehicle-to-concept coverage gaps.

This graph is ready for pilot use. I would use it to plan my Year 4 English teaching. With the fixes above, I would trust an AI to generate first-draft lessons from it.
