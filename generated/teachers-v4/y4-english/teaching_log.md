# Teaching Log: Week 1 -- The Iron Man Unit
## Ms Amara Okonkwo, Year 4

**Context:** 28 children. Mixed-ability class with reading ages ranging from 6:08 to 11:02. 4 children receiving additional reading intervention. 3 children with EAL (fluent conversational English but academic vocabulary still developing). 1 child with an EHCP for speech and language needs. High engagement with fiction generally; this class loves being read to.

## Lesson 1 -- Monday: First Encounter: Prediction and Setting

### What happened

Started with the cover of *The Iron Man* -- no blurb, as planned. Immediately got more engagement than expected. Several children had heard of the book ("My dad read this!") but most had not. The cover illustration provoked strong reactions: "Is he a robot?", "He looks scary", "Is he a baddie?" I collected predictions on sticky notes for the working wall.

The read-aloud of Chapter 1 was electric. When the Iron Man falls off the cliff and his body scatters, I heard actual gasps. Elijah said, "Is he dead?" and Maya said, "He can't be, it's only Chapter 1." This was an inference moment I had not planned for -- Maya was using her knowledge of story structure to predict, which is exactly EN-Y4-C027 in action.

The close reading of Hughes's language went well. I had them in pairs annotating an enlarged copy of the opening paragraph. The comparison technique landed beautifully: "eyes like headlamps" and "head shaped like a dustbin" generated strong discussion. I asked the Thinking Lens question from Perspective and Interpretation: "Why does Hughes compare the Iron Man to everyday objects?" Amira said, "Because we don't know what an iron man looks like, so he gives us things we know." That is a Year 4 child articulating the concept of authorial purpose. I wrote it on the working wall.

### What the vehicle data informed

The vehicle (EN-Y4-CV001) specifying *Stig of the Dump* as a companion text shaped my forward planning. Having the suggested texts explicit in the vehicle data meant I could prepare the *Stig* extract for Friday in advance. Without that vehicle property, I would have been scrambling for a comparison text mid-week.

The grammar focus from the vehicle -- fronted adverbials, expanded noun phrases, direct speech -- gave me a clear directive for what to notice during reading. I was deliberately collecting expanded noun phrases onto the grammar working wall because the vehicle told me this was coming. This is significantly better than noticing grammar features ad hoc.

### How the Thinking Lens questions landed

The Evidence and Argument lens question ("What clues in the text support your prediction?") was effective but needed simplification. I rephrased it as: "What in the book made you think that?" This is essentially the same question but in language 8-year-olds naturally use. The AI instruction text for the lens says "prompt pupils to distinguish evidence from assertion" -- I would not use those words with Year 4, but the principle is sound. I asked: "Is that a guess or did something in the book tell you that?" Several children started self-correcting: "Well, I think he's a baddie because he's big and scary -- but actually the book doesn't say he's bad."

### What I would change

I underestimated how long the prediction activity would take. The children wanted to discuss their predictions at length. I cut the close reading from 15 minutes to 10, which was too short. Next time, I would reduce the prediction sharing to pairs only (not whole class) and give more time to annotation. The language analysis is where the real learning happens for this unit.

### Assessment notes

Most children could make predictions. About 60% could justify with textual evidence rather than personal opinion. The remaining 40% made predictions based on what they wanted to happen ("I think he will make friends") rather than what the text suggested. This is the distinction between EN-Y4-C027 (prediction from stated and implied detail) and wishful thinking. I need to address this explicitly in Lesson 4.

## Lesson 2 -- Tuesday: Inference: What Is the Iron Man Thinking?

### What happened

The comprehension check on Chapter 1 revealed that Jayden, Priya, and Oliver had not fully followed the sequence of events. All three are in my lower reading group. The Iron Man falling apart and reassembling was confusing for them -- they thought it was two different characters. This is a comprehension monitoring issue (EN-Y4-C024): they did not notice their understanding had broken down. I reread the passage with them at break time.

Chapter 2 read-aloud: the children were completely absorbed. The Iron Man returning night after night to eat machinery -- the repetition in Hughes's prose created a satisfying rhythm. I paused for comprehension monitoring as planned and asked, "Does this make sense?" Several children said yes, but Fatima raised her hand: "Why does he keep coming back? Why doesn't he eat all the metal at once?" Excellent comprehension monitoring -- she noticed a puzzle in the text rather than just accepting it.

The inference grid was the strongest part of the lesson. Working in pairs, children had to find exact quotes before making inferences. The requirement for two pieces of evidence forced them beyond surface-level reading. Highlights:

- Nathan and Zara inferred that the Iron Man is lonely because "he comes back to the same place" and "he never talks to anyone." Nathan said, "It's like he's looking for something but he doesn't know what it is." I wrote this on the working wall as an exemplary inference.

- The Thinking Lens question about the Iron Man's silence was powerful. "The Iron Man never speaks in the whole book. What can we infer from this silence?" This provoked genuine debate. Some children thought he was stupid ("He's just a machine"). Others argued he was misunderstood ("Maybe he speaks a different language"). Amira connected back to Perspective: "We never hear his side. The whole book is about him but we never know what he thinks." This is a sophisticated observation for Year 4 -- the concept of narrative perspective and whose voice is missing.

### What the vehicle data informed

The vehicle lists EN-Y4-C026 (Drawing inferences with evidence) as a delivered concept. The graph's concept teaching guidance was directly useful here: it says "Teach children to consider what is deliberately left unsaid as well as what is stated." I used this exact framing -- the deliberate silence of the Iron Man -- as my central teaching point. Without that guidance, I might have focused only on what the text says rather than what it withholds.

The grammar working wall continued to build. Collecting fronted adverbials from the text as we read ("Night after night," "Far away,") means that by Wednesday's grammar lesson (Lesson 6 next week), children will already have 10+ examples to work with. The vehicle's specification that fronted adverbials are a grammar focus for this unit gives me permission to foreground them during reading lessons, which I might not otherwise do.

### How the Thinking Lens questions landed

The Evidence and Argument lens question worked well at the inference stage. When children made unsupported inferences, I said: "What is your evidence? Show me where in the text." This is directly from the lens AI instruction. The children started using the language: "My evidence is on page 12 where it says..."

The Perspective and Interpretation lens question about the Iron Man's silence was the highlight of the lesson. It transformed a comprehension activity into a genuine literary discussion. The AI instruction says "look for omissions or contradictions" -- the Iron Man's silence is exactly an omission, and asking children to notice it pushed them into higher-order thinking.

### What I would change

The inference grid took longer than planned. I allocated 20 minutes and needed 25. The plenary (writing one inference with evidence) was rushed -- some children wrote inferences without evidence because they ran out of time. Next time, I would reduce the number of rows in the grid from four to three and protect the plenary writing time. The plenary is my assessment evidence; I cannot afford to rush it.

### Assessment notes

Strong lesson. About 75% of children could draw inferences supported by textual evidence. The remaining 25% could make reasonable inferences but struggled to locate specific evidence. Two children (Jayden, Oliver) are still at the retrieval stage -- they can find information in the text but are not yet making inferences from it. I will pair them with stronger readers for Lesson 4's discussion activity.

## Lesson 3 -- Wednesday: The Problem-Resolution Structure

### What happened

The genre investigation was more interesting than I expected. I asked: "What kind of story is *The Iron Man*?" and got six different answers: fairy tale, myth, science fiction, adventure, fantasy, and horror. This became a genuine classification activity. We listed the features of each genre and checked them against the text:
- Myth: quest, moral, supernatural -- partially yes
- Science fiction: technology, the future -- partially yes
- Adventure: protagonist, antagonist, problem, resolution -- yes

I used the vehicle's genre label ("adventure narrative") to settle the discussion, but I told the children that good books often cross genre boundaries. *The Iron Man* is an adventure narrative with elements of myth and science fiction. Several children found this satisfying -- it explained why they could not agree.

The structural mapping was the core of the lesson. Drawing the problem-resolution structure on the board and filling it in together worked well. The Structure and Function Thinking Lens question ("Why is the story structured this way? What would happen if Hughes had started with the trap?") provoked an interesting response from Leo: "If he started with the trap, we wouldn't care about the Iron Man yet, so we wouldn't be interested in whether he escapes." This child has intuitively grasped the purpose of narrative structure -- you need the opening to establish the character before the reader will invest in the conflict.

The theme discussion was harder. When I asked "What is this story really about?", the first response was "an iron man" (from several children). I had to scaffold heavily: "Not what happens -- what is the story really about?" Eventually we got to: fear of things we don't understand, friendship between different kinds of beings, solving problems with cleverness instead of violence. I started the theme-tracking chart.

### What the vehicle data informed

The vehicle's genre label ("adventure narrative") and its success criteria ("Identify the problem-resolution structure in the model text") gave this lesson a clear focus. Without the vehicle, I would have taught a generic "story structure" lesson. With the vehicle, I taught the specific structure of an adventure narrative: protagonist, antagonist, problem, complication, climax, resolution. The vocabulary list from the vehicle (narrative, protagonist, antagonist, setting, climax, resolution, suspense, dialogue) gave me the exact terminology to introduce.

The cross-reference to EN-Y4-CV002 (Greek Myths) was useful. I asked: "How does the Iron Man's structure compare to the Greek myths we studied?" Children immediately saw the parallels: hero, quest, monster, resolution. This cross-vehicle connection strengthens both units.

### How the Thinking Lens questions landed

The Structure and Function lens was the right choice for this lesson. "How does the structure of this story enable it to work as an adventure?" is a question that Year 4 children can access. Leo's answer about the trap proved it. However, I found the lens AI instruction ("prompt pupils to examine physical features and ask why they are shaped or arranged as they are") too oriented toward science/design contexts. For English, I adapted it: "Look at how the story is put together and ask why each part is in that order." The principle is the same but the language needs to be subject-specific.

### What I would change

I spent too long on genre classification (fun but not essential) and not enough on structural mapping (essential). The theme discussion felt rushed. I would restructure: 5 minutes on genre, 25 minutes on structure and theme combined, with the theme discussion flowing directly from the structural analysis. The question "What problem does the author solve with this resolution?" naturally leads to "What is the author really saying?" which is a theme question.

I also want to note that Chapter 3 was only summarised, not read. This is a compromise I made for time, but it means children's understanding of the full plot relies partly on my summary rather than the text itself. For next year, I would schedule this as a four-week unit, or assign Chapter 3 as a guided reading group activity earlier in the week.

### Assessment notes

Most children could identify the problem-resolution structure when scaffolded. About 50% could identify it independently (could map their own structure without my prompting). Theme identification was weaker -- perhaps 30% could articulate a theme beyond "it's about an iron man." This is developmentally appropriate for Year 4; theme work develops across the year. The vehicle's assessment question ("Can pupils identify the problem-resolution structure in The Iron Man?") is achievable for most children by the end of the unit. We are on track.

## Lesson 4 -- Thursday: The Climax and the Space-Bat-Angel-Dragon

### What happened

This was the lesson I had been waiting for. Reading the climax of *The Iron Man* aloud to 28 eight-year-olds who are genuinely invested in the story is one of the great pleasures of teaching. The Space-Bat-Angel-Dragon's arrival produced open-mouthed silence. When the Iron Man challenges the dragon to a contest of endurance, Marcus whispered, "He's going to lose." When the Iron Man wins by surviving being heated in the furnace, the class broke into spontaneous applause. I have never had that reaction to a read-aloud before. Ted Hughes earned it.

The Tell Me discussion in groups of four was strong. Groups found genuine puzzles:
- "Why does the Iron Man save the humans when they tried to trap him?" (Theme question)
- "Why does Hughes make the dragon turn into music? That's weird." (Authorial choice question)
- "Why doesn't the Iron Man just fight the dragon? Why a contest?" (Plot choice question)

The Thinking Lens question about the contest vs fighting was particularly productive. "The Iron Man challenges the dragon to a contest of endurance rather than fighting. What does this tell us about how problems should be solved?" Amira again (she is having an outstanding week): "Hughes is saying you don't have to fight to win. The Iron Man is cleverer than the dragon even though he's smaller." Marcus challenged her: "But is it clever or is it brave? He gets burned -- that's not clever, that's brave." This is exactly the kind of evaluative discussion the Evidence and Argument lens is designed to provoke.

The reading response writing (justifying views with evidence) produced the strongest written work of the week. Having built up evidence across four lessons, most children could now support their theme interpretations with specific references.

### What the vehicle data informed

The vehicle delivers EN-Y4-C026 (inference) and EN-Y4-C027 (prediction). Both were tested heavily in this lesson. The vehicle's assessment question -- "Can they make inferences about characters using evidence from the text?" -- was directly assessed through the inference grid in Lesson 2 and the discussion/written response today. I can now say: yes, about 80% of the class can do this with confidence.

The grammar focus on direct speech punctuation (EN-Y4-C057) was previewed by finding examples in the text. Hughes uses relatively little dialogue in *The Iron Man*, which is itself an interesting teaching point. But the dialogue that exists (Hogarth's conversations, the Iron Man's challenge) provided enough examples for the grammar wall.

### How the Thinking Lens questions landed

The Evidence and Argument lens question about the contest was the standout moment of the week. "What is your interpretation and what evidence supports it?" became a genuine debate. Children were arguing with each other -- citing different moments in the text to support different interpretations of the same scene. This is what the lens is for.

The Perspective and Interpretation lens also surfaced naturally. When one group puzzled over the dragon's transformation into music, I asked: "Whose perspective might explain this? What might Hughes have been thinking?" Fatima said: "Maybe Hughes thinks that even scary things can become beautiful if you give them a chance." This is theme articulation of a very high order for Year 4.

I want to be honest: not all children engaged at this level. About 6-8 children participated in the discussion enthusiastically but could not translate their verbal ideas into written evidence. Their reading journals contain vague statements like "I think the theme is friendship because they become friends." This is a valid start but lacks the specificity that EN-Y4-C064 (justifying views independently) requires. More scaffolding needed for these children -- sentence starters with evidence slots.

### What I would change

The Tell Me discussion took longer than 15 minutes because the puzzles were so rich. I do not regret this -- the discussion quality was exceptional -- but it meant the written response was rushed again. I am noticing a pattern: I consistently underestimate discussion time and lose writing time. For the next unit, I need to plan shorter discussions with structured talk protocols (2 minutes each, then rotate) rather than open-ended group conversations that stretch.

### Assessment notes

Assessment codes: No formal test framework codes apply to this lesson's reading focus (another gap -- reading comprehension content domains are still not mapped in the assessment layer). However, the vehicle's assessment criteria give me clear benchmarks. Informal assessment: 22/28 children can make inferences about characters using evidence from the text. 6 children need additional scaffolding -- they can infer but struggle to locate and cite evidence.

## Lesson 5 -- Friday: Comparing Texts: The Iron Man and Stig of the Dump

### What happened

Reading the *Stig of the Dump* extract cold was a good test of whether children could apply their reading skills to an unfamiliar text. Most could. The comparison activity was structured enough that even weaker readers could participate -- the grid gave them a framework.

The comparison generated some excellent observations:
- "Both stories have a child who finds someone nobody else understands, but Barney's reaction is curiosity and Hogarth's reaction is fear."
- "Stig's dump is described as cosy and warm. The Iron Man's cliff is cold and dark. The settings show us how to feel about the character."
- "Hughes makes you scared of the Iron Man first, then you like him. Clive King makes you like Stig straight away."

The Perspective and Interpretation lens question ("What might each author have left out?") was challenging but productive. Aisha said: "Hughes left out what the Iron Man was feeling. King tells you what Stig is feeling because Barney interprets it." This is a Year 4 child identifying the difference between external and internal focalization. She does not know the terminology, but she has grasped the concept.

The summarising activity (EN-Y4-C028) was weaker. Many children produced retellings rather than summaries. I had to model the difference explicitly: "A retelling tells everything that happened. A summary captures only the essential events." Even after modelling, about 40% of the class could not summarise *The Iron Man* in five sentences or fewer. Summarising across a whole text is significantly harder than summarising across paragraphs -- the vehicle does not explicitly address this, but the concept teaching guidance for EN-Y4-C028 says "Set word limits to force conciseness," which is exactly what I did.

The bridge to writing was well-received. Telling children they would write their own adventure narrative immediately provoked excited chatter. Several children already had character ideas. "Can my outsider be an alien?" "Can mine be a dragon?" "Can mine be a girl?" (Yes, yes, and obviously yes.)

### What the vehicle data informed

The companion text (*Stig of the Dump*) specified in the vehicle data was a good choice. It is at a similar reading level, shares the outsider/friendship theme, and offers enough contrast for meaningful comparison. Having this recommendation built into the vehicle saved me the planning time of selecting an appropriate companion text myself.

The vehicle's key vocabulary list (narrative, protagonist, antagonist, setting, climax, resolution, suspense, dialogue) has been introduced across the week through the reading. By Friday, most children were using "protagonist" and "climax" naturally in their discussions. This vocabulary progression was not something I planned explicitly -- it emerged from the vehicle data guiding my teaching.

The bridge to next week -- "You will write your own adventure narrative, 500-700 words" -- was strengthened by having the vehicle's word count specification. Children know exactly what is expected. The success criteria from the vehicle will become their self-assessment checklist.

### How the Thinking Lens questions landed

The Perspective and Interpretation lens was the right choice for comparison work. "How does each author present their outsider character differently, and what shapes those different presentations?" pushed children beyond surface comparison (one is metal, one is a caveman) into authorial choice analysis. However, the question as stated was too complex for Year 4. I broke it into two: "How does each author show us their character?" and "Why did each author make those choices?" The second question is harder and only about 40% of the class could engage with it meaningfully.

The Patterns lens might have been more accessible for the comparison activity -- "What patterns do you notice across both stories?" -- but the vehicle context data assigned Perspective and Interpretation as the primary lens for D003-CL002. In practice, both lenses were at work: children were noticing patterns (both have child protagonists, both have outsider characters) and interpreting perspectives (Hughes foregrounds fear, King foregrounds friendship). The lenses are not mutually exclusive in a real classroom.

### What I would change

The summarising activity needs more scaffolding. Next time, I would give children a frame: "The Iron Man is about _____ who _____. The problem is _____. In the end, _____." This reduces the cognitive load while still requiring them to identify essential information. The open "summarise in five sentences" prompt was too unstructured for most children at this point in the year.

The expanded noun phrase collection from both texts (the closing grammar activity) was rushed to three minutes. This is valuable content for next week's grammar lessons, so I should protect this time. I might move the summarising activity to guided reading and use the Friday lesson entirely for comparison and grammar preparation.

### Assessment notes

End-of-week informal assessment against vehicle criteria:
- **Problem-resolution structure:** 75% can identify it; 50% can identify it independently
- **Inferences with evidence:** 80% can make inferences; 65% can support with specific textual evidence
- **Effective language analysis:** 70% can discuss language choices and their effects

These are reading assessment scores. The writing assessment will come at the end of Week 3. On the basis of this week's reading, I am confident that most children have a strong enough understanding of the model text to write their own adventure narrative. The vehicle data has given me exactly the right combination of text, genre, and focus areas to make this unit work.

## Weekly Reflection

### Strengths this week
1. The text choice was outstanding. *The Iron Man* is short enough to read in a week, rich enough to sustain analysis, and dramatic enough to hold children's attention. The vehicle's selection was validated by the classroom response.
2. The Thinking Lens questions added genuine depth to discussions. Evidence and Argument and Perspective and Interpretation are the right lenses for reading comprehension work.
3. The grammar working wall is building organically from reading. By collecting examples from the text during comprehension lessons, the grammar focus (fronted adverbials, expanded noun phrases, direct speech) does not feel bolted on.

### Areas for development
1. Time management in discussion lessons. I consistently lose writing time to rich discussion. I need to be more disciplined.
2. Summarising skills are weaker than expected. I need to do more explicit teaching of this before the non-fiction unit (EN-Y4-CV005).
3. Six children need additional inference scaffolding. I will use guided reading groups next week to target this.
4. The Thinking Lens questions need Year 4 translation. The AI instruction language is pitched at the teacher/platform level, not at the child. This is correct -- the teacher should translate -- but I would value having a child-facing version of each key question.

### Vehicle data verdict after one week
Having the text, genre, grammar focus, writing outcome, assessment criteria, and success criteria all specified in the vehicle data made my planning significantly more efficient and more focused. Last year, planning this unit took me two full evenings. This year, with the vehicle data, it took one -- and the plan is better because the connections between reading and writing are explicit rather than intuitive.

The suggested texts were appropriate. The grammar focus was correct for Year 4 and aligned naturally with the text. The writing outcome (500-700 words, adventure narrative) is ambitious but achievable. The success criteria will translate directly into children's self-assessment checklists.

This is what I asked for in my v4 review: texts. The graph now has texts. And they make all the difference.
