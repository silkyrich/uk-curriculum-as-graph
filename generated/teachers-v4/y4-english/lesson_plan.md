# Year 4 English: 3-Week Unit Plan -- The Iron Man
## Ms Amara Okonkwo, Year 4 Class Teacher and English Lead

**Core Text Vehicle:** EN-Y4-CV001 -- Adventure Narrative: The Iron Man (text_study)
**Core Text:** *The Iron Man* by Ted Hughes
**Companion Text:** *Stig of the Dump* by Clive King (extracts for comparison)
**Duration:** 3 weeks, 15 lessons (5 per week)
**Writing Outcome:** Write an adventure narrative (500-700 words) with clear problem-resolution structure, vivid description, and dialogue (from EN-Y4-CV001)

---

## Unit Overview

This unit is built directly from Content Vehicle EN-Y4-CV001, which specifies:
- **Genre:** adventure narrative
- **Grammar focus:** fronted adverbials (EN-Y4-C056), expanded noun phrases (EN-Y4-C058), direct speech punctuation (EN-Y4-C057)
- **Success criteria:** Identify the problem-resolution structure in the model text; make inferences about characters supported by textual evidence; write an adventure narrative with clear structure (opening, build-up, climax, resolution); use fronted adverbials, expanded noun phrases, and correctly punctuated dialogue

The unit integrates reading comprehension, grammar in context, and composition, drawing on clusters from three domains:
- **EN-Y4-D003** (Reading Comprehension): CL002 (literary themes/forms), CL003 (infer, predict, justify)
- **EN-Y4-D006** (Composition): CL001 (plan, generate, rehearse), CL002 (structure with paragraphs/conventions), CL003 (evaluate, edit, present)
- **EN-Y4-D007** (VGP): CL001 (extend sentences -- fronted adverbials, direct speech), CL003 (expanded noun phrases, figurative language)

**Thinking Lenses applied across the unit:**
- **Perspective and Interpretation** (primary lens for D003-CL002): "Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?"
- **Evidence and Argument** (primary lens for D003-CL003): "What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?"
- **Structure and Function** (primary lens for D006-CL001 and CL002): "How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?"
- **Patterns** (primary lens for D007-CL001 and CL003): "What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?"

**Spelling:** Daily 15-minute discrete session runs alongside this unit using EN-Y4-CV007 (Word Detective). The spelling focus listed per lesson is the pattern being practised that week, not a standalone lesson.

## Week 1: Reading and Comprehension -- Into The Iron Man

**Focus:** Immersion in the text. Reading for comprehension, inference, and prediction. Analysing the author's craft. Introducing the genre features of adventure narrative.

---

### Lesson 1 -- First Encounter: Prediction and Setting
**Date:** Monday, Week 1
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C027 (Prediction from stated and implied detail), EN-Y4-C022 (Effective language in texts), EN-Y4-C016 (Wide reading for positive attitudes)
**Thinking Lens:** Evidence and Argument -- "What clues in the text support your prediction?"
**Vehicle link:** EN-Y4-CV001 delivers C016, C027

**Structure:**
1. **Hook (5 min):** Show the cover of *The Iron Man*. No blurb. Children write three predictions in their reading journals: What is this book about? Who is the Iron Man? Is he good or bad? Share predictions with a partner -- each pair must justify with evidence from the cover illustration alone.

2. **Shared reading (15 min):** Read Chapter 1 aloud ("The Coming of the Iron Man"). Pause at the cliff-edge moment: "The Iron Man came to the top of the cliff." Ask: "What do you think will happen?" Collect predictions on the working wall. Continue reading to the end of the chapter -- the fall and the rebuilding.

3. **Close reading -- language analysis (15 min):** Return to the opening paragraph. Display it on the board. Children annotate in pairs: highlight words and phrases that create atmosphere. Focus on Hughes's language: "Taller than a house... his head was shaped like a dustbin... his eyes like headlamps." Discuss: Why does Hughes compare the Iron Man to everyday objects? What effect does this have? (Thinking Lens: Perspective -- Hughes wants us to see something unfamiliar through familiar comparisons.)

4. **Prediction revisit (5 min):** Return to initial predictions. Which have been confirmed? Which need revising? What new predictions can we make for Chapter 2? Record in reading journals with evidence.

**Grammar link:** Notice Hughes's expanded noun phrases: "eyes like headlamps", "iron fingers", "the great iron head". Collect examples on the grammar working wall (EN-Y4-C058).

**Spelling focus:** Prefixes in-/im-/il-/ir- (EN-Y4-C032). Link to text vocabulary: impossible, incredible, immense, irregular.

**Assessment:** Can pupils make predictions justified by textual evidence? Can they identify effective language choices?

---

### Lesson 2 -- Inference: What Is the Iron Man Thinking?
**Date:** Tuesday, Week 1
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C026 (Drawing inferences with evidence), EN-Y4-C024 (Comprehension monitoring), EN-Y4-C022 (Effective language)
**Thinking Lens:** Evidence and Argument -- "What is the evidence for what the Iron Man feels?"
**Vehicle link:** EN-Y4-CV001 delivers C026

**Structure:**
1. **Recap and comprehension check (5 min):** Quick-fire retrieval questions on Chapter 1 to check understanding. Address any comprehension breakdowns (EN-Y4-C024). "What happened first? What happened after the Iron Man fell? How did he rebuild himself?"

2. **Read Chapter 2 (10 min):** "The Return of the Iron Man." Read aloud, pausing for comprehension monitoring: "Does this make sense? What confused you? What fix-up strategy could you use?"

3. **Inference focus (20 min):** The Iron Man eats Hogarth's father's tractor. Teach the inference equation: **Text clues + What we already know = Inference**.

   Inference grid activity (pairs):
   | What the Iron Man does | What the text says exactly | What we can infer | Our evidence |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | Returns to the cliff | "night after night" | He is driven by something -- hunger? longing? | The repetition suggests compulsion |
   | Eats metal | "crunching, munching" | He needs metal to survive -- it is food to him | Sound words suggest satisfaction/hunger |
   | Ignores people | - | He does not understand human concerns | No dialogue -- he never speaks |

   Key teaching point: The Iron Man never speaks in the whole book. What can we infer from this silence? (Perspective lens: Whose voice is missing? What would the Iron Man say if he could speak?)

4. **Plenary (5 min):** Children write one inference about the Iron Man in their reading journals, supported by at least two pieces of textual evidence.

**Grammar link:** Identify Hughes's use of fronted adverbials: "Night after night, the Iron Man came back." "Far away, on a remote hillside..." Collect on the grammar wall (EN-Y4-C056). Notice the comma after each one.

**Spelling focus:** Prefixes continued. Sort words: impossible/imperfect (im- before p/b/m) vs illegal/illogical (il- before l) vs irregular/irresponsible (ir- before r).

**Assessment:** Can pupils draw inferences supported by multiple pieces of textual evidence?

---

### Lesson 3 -- The Problem-Resolution Structure
**Date:** Wednesday, Week 1
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C029 (Language, structure and presentation contributing to meaning), EN-Y4-C020 (Themes and conventions), EN-Y4-C019 (Fairy stories, myths and legends)
**Thinking Lens:** Structure and Function -- "How does the structure of this story enable it to work as an adventure?"
**Vehicle link:** EN-Y4-CV001 delivers C019; success criteria specify identifying the problem-resolution structure

**Structure:**
1. **Genre investigation (10 min):** What kind of story is *The Iron Man*? Is it a myth? A fairy tale? An adventure? Discuss features. Introduce the adventure narrative genre features from the vehicle: protagonist, antagonist, problem, quest, climax, resolution. How does *The Iron Man* compare to myths we read earlier this year (cross-reference to EN-Y4-CV002 -- Greek Myths)?

2. **Mapping the structure (20 min):** Read Chapter 3 ("What's to Be Done with the Iron Man?") or summarise if time is short. Together, map the story so far onto the problem-resolution structure:

   | Structure element | What happens in The Iron Man | How does this serve the story? |
   |---|---|---|
   | **Opening/Setting** | The Iron Man appears on the cliff | Creates mystery -- where did he come from? |
   | **Problem** | He eats farmers' machinery | Creates conflict between Iron Man and humans |
   | **Build-up** | Hogarth's plan to trap him | Introduces the protagonist's agency |
   | **Complication** | The trap works... but then what? | Raises the stakes |

   Thinking Lens focus: "Why is the story structured this way? What would happen if Hughes had started with the trap? What job does each section do?" (Structure and Function)

3. **Theme discussion (10 min):** What is this story really about? (Thinking Lens: Perspective) Just a robot eating metal? Or something deeper -- fear of the unknown, judging things by appearance, humans vs nature? Begin a theme-tracking chart on the working wall. Children suggest themes with evidence.

**Grammar link:** Analyse sentence length in the trap scene. Hughes uses short sentences for tension: "They stopped. They listened. The Iron Man was coming." (EN-Y4-C052 -- varied sentence structure). Why does this work? (Structure and Function lens)

**Spelling focus:** Suffix -ation (EN-Y4-C032). Link to story vocabulary: destruction, exploration, observation, imagination.

**Assessment:** Can pupils identify the problem-resolution structure and explain how each element serves the story?

---

### Lesson 4 -- The Climax and the Space-Bat-Angel-Dragon
**Date:** Thursday, Week 1
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C026 (Inference), EN-Y4-C027 (Prediction), EN-Y4-C064 (Justifying views independently), EN-Y4-C031 (Discussion about books)
**Thinking Lens:** Evidence and Argument -- "What is your interpretation and what evidence supports it?"
**Vehicle link:** EN-Y4-CV001 delivers C026, C027

**Structure:**
1. **Read Chapters 4-5 (15 min):** Read the climax (the Space-Bat-Angel-Dragon threatens the world) and the resolution (the Iron Man's challenge, his transformation). This is the most dramatic section -- read expressively, pausing for children's reactions.

2. **Discussion (15 min):** Book discussion in groups of four using the "Tell Me" framework (EN-Y4-C031):
   - What did you like?
   - What puzzled you?
   - What patterns or connections did you notice?

   Each group must agree on one puzzle and one pattern to share with the class. Thinking Lens question: "The Iron Man challenges the dragon to a contest of endurance rather than fighting. What does this tell us about how problems should be solved? What is Hughes's perspective on conflict?"

3. **Justifying views (10 min):** Write a reading response in journals: "I think the main theme of The Iron Man is... because..." with at least three pieces of evidence (EN-Y4-C064). Share with a partner -- partner challenges with "But what about..." to push for stronger justification (Evidence and Argument lens).

**Grammar link:** Notice Hughes's use of direct speech in the climax. Find examples and check the punctuation pattern: reporting clause, comma, inverted commas, spoken words, punctuation inside inverted commas, close inverted commas (EN-Y4-C057).

**Spelling focus:** Suffix -ous (EN-Y4-C032). Link: dangerous, monstrous, enormous, marvellous, mysterious.

**Assessment:** Can pupils justify their interpretations of the text's themes with specific textual evidence?

---

### Lesson 5 -- Comparing Texts: The Iron Man and Stig of the Dump
**Date:** Friday, Week 1
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C020 (Themes and conventions), EN-Y4-C022 (Effective language), EN-Y4-C028 (Summarising main ideas), EN-Y4-C017 (Reading for different purposes)
**Thinking Lens:** Perspective and Interpretation -- "How does each author present their outsider character differently, and what shapes those different presentations?"
**Vehicle link:** EN-Y4-CV001 suggests *Stig of the Dump* as companion text

**Structure:**
1. **Introduce companion text (5 min):** Read the extract from *Stig of the Dump* where Barney first discovers Stig in the dump. This is the second suggested text from the vehicle.

2. **Comparison activity (20 min):** Paired work -- compare the two texts using a structured grid:

   | Feature | The Iron Man | Stig of the Dump |
   |---|---|---|
   | How is the outsider introduced? | Mystery, fear, awe | Curiosity, surprise, friendship |
   | What language creates atmosphere? | "Taller than a house" -- scale, power | "A sort of cave" -- cosiness, discovery |
   | What is the problem? | Iron Man threatens human world | Stig is alone, misunderstood |
   | Who is the protagonist? | Hogarth (child who befriends the outsider) | Barney (child who befriends the outsider) |
   | Shared conventions? | Child protagonist, outsider character, friendship theme | Same pattern |

   Thinking Lens: "What might Hughes have left out? What might Clive King have left out? Whose perspective are we reading from -- and whose perspective is missing?" (Perspective and Interpretation)

3. **Summarising (10 min):** Summarise the key events of *The Iron Man* in no more than five sentences. Teach: a summary captures the essential information, not every detail (EN-Y4-C028). Peer evaluation: is the summary concise? Does it capture the main ideas?

4. **Bridge to writing (5 min):** Introduce next week's writing focus. "You are going to write your own adventure narrative, inspired by *The Iron Man*. You will create your own outsider character, your own problem, and your own resolution. The vehicle tells us the writing should be 500-700 words with clear problem-resolution structure, vivid description, and dialogue."

**Grammar link:** Collect expanded noun phrases from both texts. How do Hughes and King build different images? "The great iron head, shaped like a dustbin but as big as a bedroom" vs King's descriptions. (EN-Y4-C058, Patterns lens)

**Spelling focus:** Dictation (EN-Y4-C039): Two sentences from *The Iron Man* including prefix/suffix words from this week.

**Assessment:** Can pupils compare themes and conventions across two texts? Can they summarise concisely?

---

## Week 2: Grammar in Context and Planning

**Focus:** Grammar skills from the vehicle (fronted adverbials, expanded noun phrases, direct speech) taught explicitly but always in the context of *The Iron Man*. Planning own adventure narrative using the model text.

---

### Lesson 6 -- Grammar Focus: Fronted Adverbials for Effect
**Date:** Monday, Week 2
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C056 (Fronted adverbials), EN-Y4-C055 (Conjunctions, adverbs and prepositions for time and cause)
**Thinking Lens:** Patterns -- "What patterns can I notice in how fronted adverbials work?"
**Vehicle link:** EN-Y4-CV001 grammar focus specifies fronted adverbials
**Assessment code:** G5.6b (Commas after fronted adverbials)

**Structure:**
1. **Investigation (10 min):** Display six sentences from *The Iron Man*, three with fronted adverbials, three without. Children sort into two groups. What is different about the first group? Teach: a fronted adverbial tells the reader when, where, or how before the main clause. It always has a comma after it. (Patterns lens: "What rule do you notice?")

2. **Classification (10 min):** Sort the collected fronted adverbials from this week's reading wall into categories:
   - **Time:** "Night after night," / "The next morning," / "Before dawn,"
   - **Place:** "Far away," / "At the top of the cliff," / "Beyond the scrapyard,"
   - **Manner:** "Silently," / "With enormous care," / "Like a great iron tower,"

3. **Sentence practice (15 min):** Children rewrite five plain sentences about *The Iron Man* by adding fronted adverbials. E.g., "The Iron Man stood on the cliff." becomes "High above the crashing waves, the Iron Man stood on the cliff." Oral rehearsal with a partner before writing each sentence (EN-Y4-C044).

4. **Application (5 min):** Write three original sentences about any scene from the book, each starting with a different type of fronted adverbial (time, place, manner). Self-check: did I use a comma?

**Spelling focus:** Homophones (EN-Y4-C034): there/their/they're, its/it's. Practise in sentence context.

**Assessment:** Can pupils use fronted adverbials of time, place, and manner with correct comma placement?

---

### Lesson 7 -- Grammar Focus: Expanded Noun Phrases for Vivid Description
**Date:** Tuesday, Week 2
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C058 (Expanded noun phrases), EN-Y4-C063 (Figurative language and academic vocabulary)
**Thinking Lens:** Patterns -- "What is the pattern for building a noun phrase? What happens when you change one part?"
**Vehicle link:** EN-Y4-CV001 grammar focus specifies expanded noun phrases
**Assessment code:** G3.2 (Expanded noun phrases)

**Structure:**
1. **Model text analysis (10 min):** Return to Hughes's descriptions. Display: "The Iron Man's eyes, each one as big as a football, were glowing." Identify the noun phrase and its modifiers. Build a model: **determiner + adjective(s) + noun + prepositional phrase/comparison**. E.g., "The enormous iron creature from beyond the stars."

2. **Expanding practice (10 min):** Start with basic nouns: "the man", "the dragon", "the cliff." Children expand in stages:
   - Add an adjective: "the tall man"
   - Add a prepositional phrase: "the tall man with iron hands"
   - Add a comparison: "the tall man with iron hands, as silent as stone"

   (Patterns lens: "Can you see the pattern for expanding? What happens to the image in your mind as each part is added?")

3. **Figurative language extension (10 min):** Link to EN-Y4-C063. Hughes uses simile and metaphor throughout: "eyes like headlamps", "the great iron head shaped like a dustbin." Children create their own figurative comparisons for a character they are beginning to imagine for their own story. Partner share: "Which comparison creates the strongest picture?"

4. **Writing application (10 min):** Describe the Iron Man arriving at a new location (a school, a city, the seaside) using at least three expanded noun phrases and one simile. Read aloud to a partner -- does the description create a vivid picture?

**Spelling focus:** Homophones continued: your/you're, whose/who's. Memory strategies.

**Assessment:** Can pupils expand noun phrases with modifiers before and after the noun? Can they use simile to create vivid description?

---

### Lesson 8 -- Grammar Focus: Direct Speech Punctuation
**Date:** Wednesday, Week 2
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C057 (Direct speech punctuation), EN-Y4-C044 (Oral rehearsal including dialogue)
**Thinking Lens:** Patterns -- "What is the consistent punctuation pattern for direct speech?"
**Vehicle link:** EN-Y4-CV001 grammar focus specifies direct speech punctuation
**Assessment code:** G5.7 (Inverted commas)

**Structure:**
1. **Drama starter (5 min):** Two children improvise a scene: Hogarth tells his father he has seen the Iron Man. Father does not believe him. Class observes: what did each character say? How did they say it?

2. **Punctuation investigation (10 min):** Display four speech sentences from the text. Children identify the pattern:
   - Reporting clause first: `Hogarth whispered, "I've seen the Iron Man."`
   - Speech first: `"Don't be silly," said his father.`
   - Interrupted speech: `"But I did," said Hogarth, "he was as tall as our house."`
   - New speaker, new line.

   Build a rules poster together (Patterns lens: "Does this always happen? What is the rule?").

3. **Oral rehearsal and writing (15 min):** Pairs rehearse a dialogue between two characters from the book orally -- speaking naturally, then adding reporting verbs: whispered, exclaimed, muttered, announced, demanded. Write the dialogue with correct punctuation. Mini-lesson on varying reporting verbs beyond "said" (EN-Y4-C044).

4. **Error hunt (10 min):** Give children a passage with deliberate speech punctuation errors. Find and correct all errors. Self-assess against the rules poster.

**Spelling focus:** Etymological patterns (EN-Y4-C035): /k/ spelt 'ch' from Greek -- character, chorus, scheme, echo. Link: "character" is a word we need for discussing The Iron Man.

**Assessment:** Can pupils punctuate direct speech correctly in all three positions (speech-first, reporting clause-first, interrupted)?

---

### Lesson 9 -- Planning: Creating Your Own Adventure Narrative
**Date:** Thursday, Week 2
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C042 (Planning from model texts), EN-Y4-C043 (Generating ideas), EN-Y4-C046 (Narrative elements: setting, character, plot)
**Thinking Lens:** Structure and Function -- "How does the structure of The Iron Man's story help it work? How will you use a similar structure for your story?"
**Vehicle link:** EN-Y4-CV001 success criteria -- "Write an adventure narrative with clear structure (opening, build-up, climax, resolution)"

**Structure:**
1. **Revisit the model structure (5 min):** Display the problem-resolution map from Lesson 3. This is our model. Each child's story should follow this structure -- but with their own characters, setting, and problem.

2. **Idea generation (15 min):** Brainstorm in response to three prompts:
   - **Your outsider character:** What is it? Where does it come from? What does it look like? What does it need? (Use expanded noun phrases from Lesson 7 to describe.) "Think about the Perspective and Interpretation lens: whose perspective will your story be told from? What might be missing from that perspective?"
   - **Your setting:** Where does the story take place? Use sensory details: what can you see, hear, smell, feel?
   - **Your problem:** What conflict arises? How does it escalate? What is the climax?

   Children discuss ideas with a talk partner, then record their strongest ideas.

3. **Boxing-up plan (15 min):** Use a 5-paragraph planning grid:

   | Paragraph | Purpose | Key content | Grammar focus |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | 1 -- Opening | Introduce setting and character | Expanded noun phrases for vivid description | Fronted adverbials of place |
   | 2 -- Build-up | Introduce the problem | Show character through action and dialogue | Direct speech |
   | 3 -- Complication | Raise the stakes | Tension-building techniques | Short sentences, fronted adverbials of time |
   | 4 -- Climax | The turning point | Most dramatic moment | Varied sentence lengths |
   | 5 -- Resolution | How the problem is solved | Theme comes through | Reflection, expanded noun phrases |

   (Structure and Function lens: "What job does each paragraph do? Why does the climax come in paragraph 4, not paragraph 2?")

4. **Peer review of plans (5 min):** Partner reads your plan. Can they identify the problem-resolution structure? Is each paragraph's purpose clear? Feedback on one strength and one improvement.

**Spelling focus:** Etymological patterns continued: /sh/ spelt 'ch' from French -- machine, chef, chalet, parachute.

**Assessment:** Can pupils plan a narrative using the model text's structure, with clear purpose for each paragraph?

---

### Lesson 10 -- Oral Rehearsal and Opening Paragraph
**Date:** Friday, Week 2
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C044 (Oral rehearsal), EN-Y4-C046 (Narrative elements), EN-Y4-C045 (Paragraphing), EN-Y4-C056 (Fronted adverbials), EN-Y4-C058 (Expanded noun phrases)
**Thinking Lens:** Structure and Function -- "What job does your opening paragraph need to do? How will you structure it to do that job?"

**Structure:**
1. **Revisit Hughes's opening (5 min):** Reread the first paragraph of *The Iron Man*. What does it achieve? (Introduces the character with vivid description; creates mystery; establishes tone.) Your opening must do the same job.

2. **Oral rehearsal (15 min):** Children rehearse their opening paragraph sentence by sentence with a talk partner. Partner listens and gives feedback: "I could picture..." or "I couldn't see..." Focus: at least one fronted adverbial of place, at least two expanded noun phrases, sensory description. Rehearse each sentence aloud before writing it.

3. **Drafting (15 min):** Write the opening paragraph (approximately 100-120 words). Teacher circulates, prompting: "Read that sentence back to me. Does it sound right? Can you add a prepositional phrase to that noun phrase? Where is your fronted adverbial?"

4. **Author's chair (5 min):** Three volunteers read their opening paragraphs aloud (EN-Y4-C051). Class gives specific feedback using the vehicle's success criteria: Is there vivid description? Can I picture the setting? Is there mystery?

**Spelling focus:** Dictation (EN-Y4-C039): Two sentences including homophones and etymological pattern words from this week.

**Assessment:** Can pupils draft an opening paragraph with fronted adverbials, expanded noun phrases, and vivid description?

---

## Week 3: Extended Writing, Editing, and Publication

**Focus:** Drafting the full narrative. Editing for the vehicle's grammar focus areas. Evaluating against success criteria. Publication and performance.

---

### Lesson 11 -- Drafting: Build-Up and Complication (Paragraphs 2-3)
**Date:** Monday, Week 3
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C046 (Narrative elements), EN-Y4-C045 (Paragraphing), EN-Y4-C044 (Oral rehearsal), EN-Y4-C057 (Direct speech)
**Thinking Lens:** Perspective and Interpretation -- "What does your character think and feel at this point? How will you show the reader without telling them directly?"

**Structure:**
1. **Revisit plan (5 min):** Reread your plan for paragraphs 2 and 3. Paragraph 2 introduces the problem; paragraph 3 raises the stakes. What is the difference between these two sections? (Structure and Function: paragraph 2 reveals; paragraph 3 escalates.)

2. **Dialogue focus (10 min):** Your build-up paragraph needs dialogue. Rehearse with a partner: one child is the protagonist, the other is a supporting character. Improvise the scene. Then write it as dialogue with correct punctuation (EN-Y4-C057). Reminder: reporting clause + comma + inverted commas + spoken words + punctuation inside + close inverted commas. Vary reporting verbs.

3. **Drafting (20 min):** Write paragraphs 2 and 3. Teacher circulates with targeted prompts:
   - "New paragraph -- you have changed the time/place/topic."
   - "Can you show me how your character feels through their actions, not just by telling me?"
   - "Where is the tension building? Use a short sentence."
   - "Read that dialogue aloud. Does it sound like something a real person would say?"

4. **Progress check (5 min):** Traffic light self-assessment: Green (on track, 3+ paragraphs drafted), Amber (some drafted, need support), Red (stuck -- book a writing conference for tomorrow).

**Spelling focus:** Statutory word list (EN-Y4-C036) words appearing in children's writing: different, disappear, imagine, particular, surprise.

**Assessment:** Can pupils write dialogue with correct punctuation and develop the problem through escalation?

---

### Lesson 12 -- Drafting: Climax and Resolution (Paragraphs 4-5)
**Date:** Tuesday, Week 3
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C046 (Narrative elements), EN-Y4-C044 (Oral rehearsal), EN-Y4-C052 (Multi-clause sentences), EN-Y4-C022 (Effective language)
**Thinking Lens:** Evidence and Argument -- "How will your resolution connect back to the theme? What evidence will the reader see?"

**Structure:**
1. **Analysing the climax (10 min):** Reread Hughes's climax (the contest between the Iron Man and the Space-Bat-Angel-Dragon). What techniques does he use? Short sentences for tension. Long sentences for the contest. Repetition. The absence of dialogue at the most intense moment. Children annotate a paragraph from the climax, identifying techniques they might borrow.

2. **Drafting the climax (15 min):** Write paragraph 4 -- the most dramatic moment. Oral rehearsal first: "Tell your partner what happens in your climax." Then write. Focus on varying sentence length: short sentences for action ("He ran. He hid. He waited."), longer sentences for description and reflection.

3. **Drafting the resolution (10 min):** Write paragraph 5 -- how the problem is solved, what the character learns. "Think about the theme you are weaving through your story. How does your ending connect to it?" (Evidence and Argument lens: "What evidence of your theme will the reader find in your resolution?")

4. **Word count check (5 min):** Count your words. The vehicle specifies 500-700 words. Are you in range? If under 500, which paragraph needs more development? If over 700, which details are not essential?

**Spelling focus:** Possessive apostrophe with plural nouns (EN-Y4-C037). Link to writing: "the children's screams", "the farmers' machines", "the villagers' fear."

**Assessment:** Can pupils write a climax with varied sentence structure and a resolution that connects to the story's theme?

---

### Lesson 13 -- Evaluating and Editing: Grammar Focus
**Date:** Wednesday, Week 3
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C048 (Evaluating writing), EN-Y4-C049 (Editing for grammar, vocabulary, consistency), EN-Y4-C054 (Pronoun choice for cohesion)
**Thinking Lens:** Evidence and Argument -- "Does the evidence in your writing support your intended effect? Where does it fall short?"
**Vehicle link:** Assessed against EN-Y4-CV001 success criteria

**Structure:**
1. **Self-evaluation against vehicle success criteria (10 min):** Children evaluate their draft against the four success criteria from EN-Y4-CV001:
   - [ ] Identified the problem-resolution structure in the model text (shown through own structure matching the model)
   - [ ] Made inferences about characters supported by textual evidence (shown through characterisation in own writing)
   - [ ] Written an adventure narrative with clear structure (opening, build-up, climax, resolution)
   - [ ] Used fronted adverbials, expanded noun phrases, and correctly punctuated dialogue

   Traffic light each criterion. Focus editing on the weakest area.

2. **Grammar editing pass (15 min):** Three focused editing passes with a coloured pen:
   - **Pass 1 -- Fronted adverbials:** Find each one. Is there a comma? Are there at least 4 across the whole piece? Vary the type (time, place, manner)?
   - **Pass 2 -- Expanded noun phrases:** Find your descriptions. Can any be expanded with a prepositional phrase? Are they vivid and precise?
   - **Pass 3 -- Direct speech:** Check every piece of dialogue against the rules poster. Is each new speaker on a new line? Correct punctuation?

3. **Cohesion check (10 min):** Read through and check pronoun reference (EN-Y4-C054). Is it always clear who "he" or "she" refers to? Are there any passages where the reader might be confused? Replace pronouns with nouns where needed for clarity. Check paragraph links: does each paragraph connect to the next?

4. **Partner feedback (5 min):** Swap with a partner. Partner identifies: one moment of vivid description they enjoyed, and one place where the grammar could be improved.

**Spelling focus:** Dictionary use for spelling (EN-Y4-C038). Children use dictionaries to verify any words they are uncertain about in their drafts.

**Assessment:** Can pupils evaluate their writing against specific success criteria and make targeted grammar edits?

### Lesson 14 -- Proof-Reading and Polishing
**Date:** Thursday, Week 3
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C050 (Proof-reading), EN-Y4-C049 (Editing for vocabulary), EN-Y4-C061 (Paragraphs to organise ideas around a theme)
**Thinking Lens:** Patterns -- "What patterns of error can you find in your writing? What patterns of success?"

**Structure:**
1. **Proof-reading lesson (10 min):** Model multi-pass proof-reading on a deliberately flawed paragraph projected on the board. Show the three-pass method:
   - Pass 1: Touch each word -- check spelling (especially statutory words and homophones)
   - Pass 2: Check sentence boundaries -- does every sentence have a capital letter and end punctuation?
   - Pass 3: Read aloud for sense -- does every sentence make sense? Does the tense stay consistent?

   Children identify the Patterns lens at work: "What patterns of error do you notice in your own writing? The same mistakes will occur more than once."

2. **Individual proof-reading (15 min):** Children proof-read their own narratives using the three-pass method. Use a different coloured pen for corrections. Focus on:
   - Homophones (their/there/they're, its/it's) -- EN-Y4-C034
   - Statutory word list words -- EN-Y4-C036
   - Consistent tense
   - Speech punctuation accuracy

3. **Vocabulary upgrade (10 min):** Reread your narrative looking for weak or repeated vocabulary. Replace at least three words with more precise alternatives. Use a thesaurus. E.g., "big" becomes "immense", "walked" becomes "strode" or "crept" (depending on context). Read the improved sentence aloud -- does the new word fit?

4. **Final check against word count (5 min):** Confirm 500-700 words. Final read-through.

**Spelling focus:** Proof-reading focus. Children specifically check for correct homophones and statutory word spellings in their narratives.

**Assessment:** Can pupils proof-read systematically and improve vocabulary choices?

### Lesson 15 -- Publication and Performance
**Date:** Friday, Week 3
**Concepts:** EN-Y4-C051 (Reading aloud own writing), EN-Y4-C048 (Evaluating writing), EN-Y4-C064 (Justifying views independently)
**Thinking Lens:** Perspective and Interpretation -- "How does the audience respond to your story? What would you change if you were writing for a different audience?"
**Vehicle link:** Full assessment against EN-Y4-CV001

**Structure:**
1. **Presentation preparation (5 min):** Children select their strongest passage (approximately 1-2 paragraphs) to read aloud to the class. Practise reading with expression: vary pace for tension and resolution, volume for drama, tone for dialogue.

2. **Performance and peer feedback (25 min):** Children read their selected passages aloud in groups of 5-6. After each reading, listeners give specific feedback using the vehicle's assessment questions:
   - "I could identify the problem-resolution structure because..."
   - "I could make an inference about your character because you showed..."
   - "Your fronted adverbial in the sentence about... created the effect of..."
   - "Your dialogue sounded realistic because..."

   Record one piece of specific feedback received in writing journals.

3. **Reflective writing (10 min):** Children write a short reflection:
   - What I learned about adventure narrative writing from studying *The Iron Man*
   - What I did well in my own story (with specific evidence from my text)
   - What I would improve if I wrote another adventure narrative
   - How the Thinking Lens questions helped my reading and writing

   (Perspective lens: "How would a reader who has never met the Iron Man respond to your story? What might they miss?")

**Spelling focus:** Personal spelling log review. Children identify the three words they most need to practise from their narrative writing.

**Final Assessment (against EN-Y4-CV001):**
- Can pupils identify the problem-resolution structure in *The Iron Man*? (reading comprehension)
- Can they make inferences about characters using evidence from the text? (reading comprehension)
- Can they write their own adventure narrative using fronted adverbials, expanded noun phrases, and correctly punctuated dialogue? (composition + grammar)
- Is the writing 500-700 words with clear structure? (composition)

## Note on Coverage Gaps

This 3-week unit is one of approximately six text-based units across the year. The concepts not covered here (EN-Y4-C030 Retrieval from non-fiction, EN-Y4-C047 Organisational devices, remaining VGP concepts like present perfect tense and Standard English verb inflections) would be covered by other Content Vehicles:
- **EN-Y4-CV005** (Non-Chronological Report) covers retrieval, organisational devices, and Standard English verb inflections
- **EN-Y4-CV003** (Persuasive Writing: Save Our Park) covers multi-clause sentences and persuasive technique
- **EN-Y4-CV002** (Greek Myths) covers themes, conventions, and present perfect tense
- **EN-Y4-CV004** (Poetry: Performance and Form) covers poetry forms and figurative language
- **EN-Y4-CV006** (Fairy Tales: Rewriting the Classics) covers comprehension monitoring and fairy tale conventions
- **EN-Y4-CV008** (Discussion and Debate) covers spoken language and balanced discussion writing

The vehicle system allows me to see at a glance which concepts each unit covers and which still need attention. This is a genuine improvement for planning.
