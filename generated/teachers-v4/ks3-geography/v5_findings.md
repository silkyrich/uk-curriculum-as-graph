# KS3 Humanities Evaluation — v5 Findings

**Teacher:** Ms Folake Adeyemi, KS3 Humanities, Manchester
**Subjects:** Geography (4 domains, 7 concepts) + History (3 domains, 4 concepts)
**Date:** February 2026
**Context:** v5 evaluation — this builds on my v4 findings. Two major additions to evaluate: Content Vehicles layer and Thinking Lenses layer. I have now planned and simulated teaching from both.

---

## Part 1: What Has Improved Since v4

### 1.1 Cross-Subject CO_TEACHES Links — FIXED

**v4 complaint:** "The absence of cross-subject connections between Geography and History is the single biggest structural failure for a humanities teacher."

**v5 status:** Fixed. The graph now has 4 cross-subject CO_TEACHES links that I specifically requested:

| Link | Reason | Rationale Quality |
|---|---|---|
| GE-KS3-C002 (Development) <-> HI-KS3-C002 (Empire) | shared_context | Excellent. Uses my exact quote: "Empire and Development are the SAME STORY told from different disciplinary perspectives." |
| GE-KS3-C004 (Population/Migration) <-> HI-KS3-C002 (Empire) | feeds_into | Excellent. Correctly identifies slave trade, colonial labour, Windrush as the historical drivers of contemporary migration patterns. |
| GE-KS3-C003 (Climate Change) <-> HI-KS3-C001 (Power/Democracy) | shared_context | Good. The connection is valid but less immediately obvious to pupils than the other two. Still useful for advanced classes. |
| GE-KS3-C007 (Geographical Skills) <-> HI-KS3-C004 (Historical Arguments) | shared_context | Excellent. Both are disciplinary methodologies. I used this in my Domesday Book lesson (Lesson 12) — proto-GIS. |

**Additional cross-subject links I did not request but the graph added:**
| Link | Quality |
|---|---|
| EN-Y4-C026 (Drawing inferences with evidence) <-> HI-KS3-C004 (Historical Arguments) | Good. English inference skills do feed into History source analysis. |
| EN-Y4-C047 (Organisational devices in non-narrative writing) <-> HI-KS3-C004 (Historical Arguments) | Good. English writing skills are the foundation for History essay writing. |
| SC-KS3-C100 (Earth composition) <-> GE-KS3-C001 (Plate Tectonics) | Essential. Same content in Science and Geography — schools must coordinate. |
| SC-KS3-C104 (Carbon cycle) <-> GE-KS3-C003 (Climate Change) | Essential. The mechanism (Science) and the consequences (Geography). |

**Verdict:** Every link I requested is now in the graph, with rationales specific enough to shape planning. The additional links (to English and Science) are a bonus I did not expect. This is the single biggest improvement since v4.

### 1.2 Geography Case Studies — FROM EMPTY TO USABLE

**v4 complaint:** "No case studies. This is the most critical gap for Geography. The NC statutory wording is 'detailed place-based exemplars at a variety of scales.' Geography IS case studies."

**v5 status:** 10 Content Vehicles for KS3 Geography. Let me evaluate each:

| Vehicle | Type | Quality | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GE-KS3-CV001 — Haiti 2010 Earthquake | case_study | 8/10 | Strong data_points, good themes, contrasting_with CV002. Missing: cholera outbreak data, data reliability notes. |
| GE-KS3-CV002 — Japan 2011 Earthquake | case_study | 8/10 | Strong data_points, Fukushima included, good contrast with Haiti. Missing: Japan's earthquake preparedness investment data. |
| GE-KS3-CV003 — Climate Change | case_study | 7/10 | Good global framing with regional case studies (Arctic, Bangladesh, Sahel). Data is headline-level — needs more regional specificity. |
| GE-KS3-CV004 — Nigeria Development | case_study | 8/10 | Excellent data_points. Resource curse theme is sophisticated. "Boko Haram" in definitions is appropriate but needs sensitivity note. |
| GE-KS3-CV005 — Lagos and London | case_study | 8/10 | Good contrasting pair. Lagos data is strong. London data (15x salary for house price) is a nice contemporary touch. |
| GE-KS3-CV006 — UK Water | case_study | 7/10 | Solid. The north-south divide framing is clear. Missing: global comparison data (the vehicle says "with global comparisons" but provides none). |
| GE-KS3-CV007 — Africa Depth Study | case_study | 6/10 | Good intent (challenging stereotypes) but data_points are too broad. "54 countries" is a fact, not a data_point for analysis. Needs specific country-level data. |
| GE-KS3-CV008 — Asia Depth Study | case_study | 6/10 | Same issue as CV007 — too broad. The "Bangladesh: 170 million in area smaller than Iowa" data_point is odd for a UK audience. Use a UK comparator. |
| GE-KS3-CV009 — Fieldwork Investigation | case_study | 5/10 | Correctly typed as adaptable. But data_points is empty. This should have example enquiry questions and indicative data types rather than being entirely blank. |
| GE-KS3-CV010 — Middle East Depth Study | case_study | 7/10 | Good themes. The Israel/Palestine inclusion is appropriate but requires a sensitivity note about teaching contested geographies. Dead Sea data is interesting. |

**Overall Geography vehicle quality: 7/10.** The hazard case studies (CV001-CV002) and the development/urbanisation case studies (CV004-CV005) are strong enough to plan from. The place depth studies (CV007-CV008) need more specific data. The fieldwork vehicle (CV009) needs content.

### 1.3 History Topic Studies — FROM NOTHING TO FUNCTIONAL

**v4 complaint:** "History is structurally present but functionally empty — 4 concepts for a subject that covers a thousand years of British history."

**v5 status:** 5 Content Vehicles for KS3 History. Evaluation:

| Vehicle | Type | Quality | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| HI-KS3-CV001 — Medieval Britain 1066-1509 | topic_study | 8/10 | Strong sources (Bayeux Tapestry, Magna Carta, Domesday Book, Froissart). Good perspectives list. Key events provide chronological spine. National Archives resource link. |
| HI-KS3-CV002 — Elizabethan Age | topic_study | 7/10 | Good key figures. Armada Portrait as source is excellent. "Colonised peoples" in perspectives is important. Tilbury speech correctly marked as "attributed." |
| HI-KS3-CV003 — Industry and Empire 1745-1901 | topic_study | 8/10 | Excellent perspectives (factory owner, child worker, enslaved African, abolitionist, colonial subject). Equiano's autobiography and Factory Commission reports are exactly right. |
| HI-KS3-CV004 — Challenges 1901-Present | topic_study | 7/10 | Good range. IWM resource link. "Windrush generation" in perspectives is important. Missing: key events lack dates for some (e.g. "Indian independence 1947" is good, but no date for Windrush arrival). |
| HI-KS3-CV005 — The Holocaust | topic_study | 9/10 | Excellent. Sources are appropriate (Anne Frank's diary, Primo Levi's testimony, Nuremberg transcripts). Perspectives list (victim, rescuer, bystander, perpetrator, liberator) follows current best practice. Key events show escalation. Two educational resource links (HET, UCL). Sensitivity note in assessment_guidance. |

**Overall History vehicle quality: 8/10.** The sources, perspectives, and key events are the data that was entirely missing in v4. Every vehicle has named primary sources with typed classifications (primary visual, primary legal, etc.). Every vehicle has multiple perspectives. The key_events provide the chronological spine I asked for. This is a transformational improvement.

### 1.4 Thinking Lenses — NEW LAYER

**v4:** Did not exist.

**v5 status:** 10 cross-subject cognitive lenses, each with description, key_question, and agent_prompt. Every cluster has 1-2 lenses assigned with ranked rationales.

**Evaluation of lenses used in my teaching:**

| Lens | Clusters | How I Used It | Quality |
|---|---|---|---|
| Systems and System Models | GE-KS3-D003-CL001 (Tectonics), GE-KS3-D002-CL001 (Place Study) | Framed Earth's interior as a system with interacting parts. Worked well — pupils built mental models. | 9/10 |
| Stability and Change | GE-KS3-D003-CL001 (Tectonics), GE-KS3-D003-CL003 (Climate) | Explained why earthquakes are sudden. Excellent fit for plate boundaries. | 9/10 |
| Cause and Effect | GE-KS3-D003-CL002 (Development), HI-KS3-D001-CL002 (Empire), HI-KS3-D002-CL001 (Holocaust) | Multi-factor causation for vulnerability. Perfect for development geography and historical causation. | 9/10 |
| Evidence and Argument | GE-KS3-D004-CL001 (Skills), HI-KS3-D003-CL001 (Historical Arguments) | Structured the aid evaluation lesson and source analysis. Good fit. | 8/10 |
| Continuity and Change Over Time | HI-KS3-D001-CL001 (Power/Democracy) | Essential for the medieval unit. The turning point / gradual shift distinction worked. | 9/10 |
| Perspective and Interpretation | HI-KS3-D001-CL002 (Empire), GE-KS3-D002-CL001 (Place Study) | Used for source analysis (Bayeux Tapestry) and colonial perspectives. | 8/10 |

**What the lenses add that was not there before:**
1. **Structured enquiry questions.** Each lens has a key_question that I can write on the board at the start of every lesson. This gives pupils a cognitive framework before they engage with the content.
2. **AI-ready prompts.** The agent_prompt on each lens tells an AI exactly how to frame questions. "Prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation" is actionable instruction. If an AI generates a lesson using the Cause and Effect lens, it will ask different questions than if it uses the Systems lens. This is how you get pedagogically coherent AI content.
3. **Cross-subject coherence.** The same lenses apply across Geography, History, and Science. When I use "Cause and Effect" in Geography (why did Haiti suffer more?) and then in History (what caused the Black Death?), pupils encounter the same cognitive framework in two disciplinary contexts. That builds transferable thinking skills.

**What the lenses do not do:**
1. They do not replace disciplinary thinking. The History lenses (Continuity and Change, Perspective and Interpretation) are specifically historical. The Geography lenses (Systems and System Models, Stability and Change) are specifically geographical. This is correct — they should not be generic.
2. They do not tell you WHEN to use each lens. The ranking (primary = recommended, secondary = alternative) is helpful but insufficient. In practice, I used 3-4 different lenses across a 5-lesson sequence on the same vehicle. The graph assigns lenses to clusters, but clusters are multi-lesson sequences, and different lessons within a cluster benefit from different lenses.

### 1.5 History Disciplinary Skills — IMPROVED

**v4 complaint:** "History should have at least 5 disciplinary skills properly threaded through the content."

**v5 status:** The graph now has HistoricalThinking skills linked to concepts:
- HT-001 (Chronological understanding) -> HI-KS3-C001
- HT-002 (Causation and consequence) -> HI-KS3-C001, HI-KS3-C002, HI-KS3-C003
- HT-003 (Change and continuity) -> HI-KS3-C001
- HT-004 (Similarity and difference) -> HI-KS3-C003
- HT-005 (Historical significance) -> HI-KS3-C001, HI-KS3-C002, HI-KS3-C003
- HT-006 (Historical evidence) -> HI-KS3-C002, HI-KS3-C003
- HT-007 (Historical interpretation) -> HI-KS3-C002

This is a significant improvement. 7 skills, properly threaded through 3 content concepts. The links make sense: chronological understanding is linked to Power/Democracy (the long-arc concept), not to the Holocaust (which is a shorter period). Evidence is linked to Empire and Holocaust (source-heavy topics), not to the more narrative Power/Democracy concept. I would add HT-006 (Evidence) to HI-KS3-C001 as well — medieval sources are important — but the current distribution is defensible.

## Part 2: Updated Rating

### Previous ratings (v4)
- Geography: 6/10
- History: 3/10
- Cross-subject connections: 1/10

### Updated ratings (v5)

| Dimension | v4 | v5 | Reason for Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Geography curriculum structure** | 6/10 | 7/10 | Unchanged structurally, but vehicles add substance |
| **Geography case study content** | 0/10 | 8/10 | From empty slots to 10 vehicles with data, maps, themes, contrasts |
| **Geography content generation** | 3/10 | 7/10 | Could now generate a reasonable hazards unit; depth studies still thin |
| **History curriculum structure** | 3/10 | 4/10 | Still only 4 concepts for 1000 years, but vehicles compensate |
| **History source material** | 0/10 | 8/10 | From nothing to named sources with typed classifications and perspectives |
| **History content generation** | 1/10 | 6/10 | Could now generate a medieval or empire unit; still cannot generate Reformation or Industrial Revolution as standalone |
| **Cross-subject connections** | 1/10 | 8/10 | 4 Geography-History links, 2 English-History links, 2 Science-Geography links, all with rationales |
| **Thinking/cognitive framing** | N/A | 8/10 | New layer. 10 lenses, well-chosen, useful in practice |
| **Assessment support** | 4/10 | 7/10 | Vehicle success_criteria and assessment_guidance are directly usable |

**Overall: Geography 7.5/10, History 6/10, Cross-subject 8/10.**

This is a meaningful improvement. Geography has gone from structurally sound but content-empty to a system I can plan from. History has gone from a skeleton to something functional, though still under-specified structurally. Cross-subject connections have gone from nearly absent to genuinely useful.

---

## Part 3: Remaining Gaps

### 3.1 Concept granularity — UNCHANGED, STILL A PROBLEM

This was my number 1 recommendation in v4. It has not been addressed.

Geography still has 7 concepts for a subject that typically has 20+ teachable units. GE-KS3-C001 (Plate Tectonics) subsumes Earth's structure, plate boundaries, hazard distribution, earthquake case studies, volcanic case studies, and hazard management. Each of those is a multi-lesson chunk that should be independently trackable.

History still has 4 concepts for a subject covering 1066 to the present day. HI-KS3-C001 (Power, Monarchy and Democracy) covers eight centuries.

The Content Vehicles partially compensate — they provide the sub-topic structure I need — but the underlying concept model is too coarse for any mastery-tracking or diagnostic assessment system.

**If this platform tracks pupil mastery at concept level, it will be tracking whether a pupil "understands plate tectonics" (a 5-week unit with 20+ sub-skills) rather than whether they can "explain subduction" (a specific, testable understanding). That is too coarse to be useful.**

### 3.2 Missing statutory Geography content — UNCHANGED

The v4 finding still stands: approximately 40% of a typical KS3 Geography course is not represented in the graph.

Missing:
- Rivers and hydrology
- Coasts and coastal processes
- Glaciation
- Rocks, weathering and soils
- Weather and climate (beyond climate change)
- Economic sectors (primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary)
- Energy and resources (beyond water)

These are bread-and-butter KS3 Geography topics that occupy roughly half the teaching time. The graph covers the "big themes" well (tectonics, development, population, climate) but misses the physical geography that underpins them.

**Practical impact:** A teacher planning a full KS3 Geography course from the graph would have material for roughly half the year. The other half would need to come from elsewhere.

### 3.3 History concept coverage — IMPROVED BUT STILL GAPS

The Content Vehicles have partially addressed this by providing period-specific content for 5 chronological periods. But the underlying concept model still collapses the Medieval period, the Reformation, the Civil War, the Industrial Revolution, the World Wars, and decolonisation into just 2 substantive concepts (C001 and C002).

**Specific gaps:**
- No concept for the Reformation / Church-State conflict (1509-1745)
- No concept for the Industrial Revolution as a distinct historical process
- No concept for the World Wars as distinct historical events
- No concept for social history (lives of ordinary people)

The vehicles (CV001-CV005) cover these periods, but the concepts they deliver are still just C001 (Power) and C002 (Empire). An AI generating content for "the Industrial Revolution" would frame it through the lens of "power" or "empire" rather than treating industrialisation as a distinct transformation of economy, society, and landscape. That is a conceptual limitation.

### 3.4 Vehicle resource arrays are mostly empty

8 out of 10 Geography vehicles and 3 out of 5 History vehicles have empty `resources` arrays. The exceptions are:
- HI-KS3-CV001 — National Archives Magna Carta collection (good)
- HI-KS3-CV004 — Imperial War Museum learning resources (good)
- HI-KS3-CV005 — Holocaust Educational Trust + UCL Centre for Holocaust Education (excellent)

The rest have no linked resources. The `map_types` tell me what maps to use but do not link to them. The `data_sources` tell me which organisations to consult but do not link to specific datasets.

For an AI generating content, this means: the vehicle says "use a tectonic plate boundary map" but the AI has no map to use. The structure is correct but the assets are not there.

### 3.5 Geography skills concept still monolithic

GE-KS3-C007 is still doing the work of 4 distinct skill families: cartographic skills, GIS/digital mapping, data handling/statistics, and fieldwork methodology. This was item 6 in my v4 recommendations and has not been addressed.

The Disciplinary Skills links (GS-KS3-001 through GS-KS3-006) partially compensate — they split the monolithic concept into 6 skills. But the concept itself remains a single node, which means mastery tracking and diagnostic assessment cannot distinguish between a pupil who is strong at fieldwork but weak at GIS.

---

## Part 4: Recommendations (Updated Priority Order)

### Must-fix

1. **Break concepts into sub-concepts.** (Unchanged from v4, still priority 1.) Geography needs ~20 concepts, History needs ~15. The Content Vehicles show that the graph team understands the sub-topic structure — the vehicles ARE the sub-topics. But they need to be reflected in the concept model for mastery tracking.

2. **Add missing statutory Geography content.** (Unchanged from v4.) Rivers, coasts, glaciation, weather, economic sectors, energy. These represent ~40% of teaching time.

3. **Populate vehicle resource arrays.** The map_types and data_sources are correct, but the actual resources (URLs, datasets, educational materials) are missing. For AI content generation, this is essential — the AI needs maps to show, not just descriptions of maps.

### Should-fix

4. **Add data reliability metadata to vehicle data_points.** The Haiti death toll figure is disputed. The graph should indicate when data_points carry uncertainty. A `data_notes` property or a reliability flag on each data_point would address this.

5. **Add cholera outbreak to GE-KS3-CV001.** This is a factual gap. The cholera introduced by UN peacekeepers is the most significant evidence about the effectiveness of international aid in Haiti. It should be in the data_points or a dedicated `additional_events` field.

6. **Add local comparison data to development vehicles.** Pupils need to contextualise abstract development data. "Haiti's GDP of $7 billion is roughly equivalent to the GDP of Sheffield" is more meaningful than "$7 billion" alone. A `local_comparisons` property on development-focused vehicles would help.

7. **Add sensitivity notes to politically sensitive vehicles.** GE-KS3-CV004 includes "Boko Haram" in definitions. GE-KS3-CV010 covers Israel/Palestine. HI-KS3-CV005 covers the Holocaust. These topics require explicit sensitivity guidance for teachers and, critically, for AI content generation. The Holocaust vehicle does this well (references UCL Centre for Holocaust Education guidance). The others do not.

### Nice-to-have

8. **Add enquiry questions to the fieldwork vehicle (CV009).** Currently empty. Should include example enquiry questions ("How does land use change along a transect from the town centre?"), indicative data types, and common fieldwork activities.

9. **Link Thinking Lenses to lessons, not just clusters.** Currently, lenses are assigned to clusters (multi-lesson sequences). In practice, I used different lenses for different lessons within the same cluster. A finer-grained assignment would help AI content generation target the right lens for each activity.

10. **Add a `contrasting_with` relationship to History vehicles.** Geography vehicles use contrasting_with brilliantly (Haiti vs Japan, Lagos vs London). History vehicles do not have this property. Contrasting cases work in History too: Magna Carta (England) vs Estates-General (France); British Empire vs Mughal Empire; Churchill's rhetoric vs Gandhi's philosophy. These would generate comparative analysis activities.

## Part 5: Content Vehicle Quality — Accuracy Audit

### 5.1 Geography Case Studies — Data Accuracy

**GE-KS3-CV001 (Haiti 2010):**
- Magnitude 7.0: CORRECT (USGS confirmed)
- 230,000+ deaths: COMMONLY CITED but DISPUTED. The Haitian government's figure; some estimates (Kolbe et al., 2010) suggest 46,000-85,000. The UN and USGS have never independently verified the 230,000 figure. **Recommendation: add a reliability note.**
- 1.5 million displaced: CORRECT (UN OCHA estimate)
- GDP $7 billion: APPROXIMATELY CORRECT for 2010 (World Bank: $6.7 billion in 2009). Acceptable rounding.
- HDI rank 168/189: CORRECT for the 2010 Human Development Report.
- "Conservative boundary" in definitions: TECHNICALLY CORRECT but geologically, the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault is more accurately described as a left-lateral strike-slip fault. "Conservative" is the UK Geography curriculum term and is appropriate for KS3 teaching.

**GE-KS3-CV002 (Japan 2011):**
- Magnitude 9.1: CORRECT (USGS upgraded from initial 8.9 to 9.0, then to 9.1)
- c.20,000 deaths: CORRECT. The confirmed death toll is approximately 19,759 with approximately 2,553 still missing (as of 2023). "c.20,000" is an appropriate approximation.
- Tsunami wave height up to 40m: CORRECT. Run-up heights of up to 40.5 metres were recorded at Miyako, Iwate Prefecture.
- GDP $5.5 trillion: APPROXIMATELY CORRECT for 2011 (World Bank: $6.16 trillion in 2011). The vehicle figure is slightly low. **Recommendation: update to $6 trillion or "approximately $6 trillion."**
- Fukushima nuclear meltdown: CORRECT. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster resulted in the meltdown of three reactor cores.

**GE-KS3-CV004 (Nigeria):**
- Population 220 million: APPROXIMATELY CORRECT (World Bank 2022 estimate: 218.5 million). Acceptable rounding.
- GDP $440 billion: APPROXIMATELY CORRECT (World Bank 2022: $477 billion). Slightly dated but acceptable.
- HDI 0.539 (rank 163): CORRECT for UNDP 2022 report.
- Oil = 90% of exports: CORRECT as an approximation (historically 85-95% depending on year). This has been dropping with diversification efforts.
- Literacy rate 62%: APPROXIMATELY CORRECT (UNESCO 2018 estimate: 62%). More recent estimates suggest improvement.
- "Boko Haram" in definitions: FACTUALLY CORRECT but requires a sensitivity note. Boko Haram is a terrorist organisation that has caused enormous suffering in northeastern Nigeria. Including it in definitions is appropriate for KS3 Geography but needs pedagogical framing guidance. **Recommendation: add a teaching_note property for sensitive terms.**

**GE-KS3-CV005 (Lagos and London):**
- Lagos: 16 million, growth rate 3.2%/year: APPROXIMATELY CORRECT. Estimates vary widely; UN estimates 15.9 million for the urban agglomeration (2023). Growth rate is approximately correct.
- London: 9 million, growth rate 0.5%/year: CORRECT for the Greater London area.
- Lagos: 60% live in informal settlements: COMMONLY CITED but estimates vary from 40-70%. **Recommendation: add "approximately" or a range.**
- London: average house price 15x median salary: APPROXIMATELY CORRECT (varies by borough; the London-wide average is approximately 12-16x depending on the data source and year).

### 5.2 History Topic Studies — Source and Figure Accuracy

**HI-KS3-CV001 (Medieval Britain):**
- Key figures are historically accurate and well-chosen. William the Conqueror, Thomas Becket, King John, Simon de Montfort, Henry VII — these represent the major power dynamics of the period.
- **Simon de Montfort is an interesting choice.** He led the baronial revolt against Henry III (not King John) and is sometimes credited with summoning the first representative Parliament (1265). He is less well-known than other medieval figures but is historically important for the development of Parliament. Good choice.
- Sources are all genuine primary sources correctly typed:
  - Bayeux Tapestry: primary visual — CORRECT
  - Magna Carta: primary legal — CORRECT
  - Domesday Book: primary administrative — CORRECT
  - Chronicles of Jean Froissart: primary written — CORRECT. Froissart's chronicles cover the period 1322-1400, including the Hundred Years War and the Peasants' Revolt.
- Key events dates are all correct.
- Perspectives list (Norman lord, Saxon peasant, medieval monk, merchant, peasant rebel) is well-chosen and covers the major social groups without being anachronistic.

**HI-KS3-CV002 (Elizabethan Age):**
- Key figures are accurate.
- **Tilbury speech correctly marked as "attributed"** — this is historically responsible. There is no contemporary eyewitness account of the speech; the text we have was recorded by Leonel Sharp years later. The vehicle handles this correctly.
- Armada Portrait as a source: EXCELLENT choice. It is a piece of propaganda that can be analysed for symbolism, power projection, and the construction of national identity.
- "Colonised peoples" in perspectives: IMPORTANT and historically responsible. Roanoke (1585) marks the beginning of English colonisation of the Americas, and including the perspective of those colonised pushes beyond the triumphalist "Golden Age" narrative.
- Founding of Roanoke colony 1585 in key_events: CORRECT.

**HI-KS3-CV003 (Industry and Empire 1745-1901):**
- Key figures: Victoria, Equiano, Seacole, Pankhurst, Brunel — good range covering monarchy, enslaved people, women, and engineering.
- **Mary Seacole inclusion:** Appropriate and historically accurate. Seacole was a Jamaican-born British nurse in the Crimean War. She is part of the NC requirement to study diverse British history. However, her inclusion has been contested in some historical circles (not for her significance, but for the specific claims made about her role relative to Florence Nightingale). The vehicle does not need to engage with this debate at KS3 level, but a teaching_note might be appropriate.
- Equiano's autobiography: CORRECT. "The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano" (1789) is the most important first-person account of the slave trade.
- Factory Commission reports 1833: CORRECT. These reports documented child labour in factories and led to the Factory Acts.
- Census data: CORRECT as a source type but vague. Which census? The 1851 census (the first reliable nationwide census) would be the most useful for KS3 purposes.
- "Scramble for Africa 1880s" in key_events: CORRECT. The Berlin Conference of 1884-85 formalised European colonisation of Africa.

**HI-KS3-CV004 (Challenges 1901-Present):**
- Key figures: Churchill, Gandhi, MLK, Mandela — all historically significant. However, this is a very male, very "great leader" list. **Missing: a woman.** Emmeline Pankhurst would fit here as she does in CV003 (the suffragette movement continued into the 20th century). Or: Rosa Parks, Windrush generation figure like Sam King or Andrea Levy.
- **Martin Luther King Jr and Nelson Mandela:** Both are important for world history but neither is British. The vehicle covers "Britain, Europe and the wider world" so this is acceptable, but the NC requirement is specifically "challenges for Britain" — the British perspective should dominate. Gandhi's role in Indian independence from Britain makes him relevant. MLK and Mandela are less directly connected to British history. **Recommendation: add at least one British figure (e.g., Clement Attlee for the welfare state, or a Windrush generation figure).**
- "Windrush 1948" in key_events: CORRECT. The HMT Empire Windrush arrived at Tilbury Docks on 22 June 1948.
- Sources listed (war poetry, propaganda posters, newsreel footage, oral histories): all correct source types. "War poetry" could be more specific — Wilfred Owen's "Dulce et Decorum Est" is the standard KS3 poem for this unit.

**HI-KS3-CV005 (The Holocaust):**
- **This is the best vehicle in the History set.** Sources are appropriate and sensitively chosen. Anne Frank's diary and Primo Levi's testimony are the standard KS3 entry points. Nuremberg trial transcripts add a legal/justice dimension. Liberation photographs are handled by all UK exam boards.
- Key events show escalation: Nuremberg Laws 1935, Kristallnacht 1938, Kindertransport 1938-39, Wannsee Conference 1942, Liberation of Auschwitz 1945. This chronological structure supports the concept description's emphasis on "gradual escalation of persecution."
- Perspectives: victim, rescuer, bystander, perpetrator, liberator. This follows the UCL Centre for Holocaust Education framework exactly. It is the standard best-practice approach.
- **"Kindertransport children" as a key figure:** This is a category, not a person. It works because it humanises the historical experience and is appropriate for KS3 pupils who are themselves children. Good pedagogical choice.
- Sensitivity note in assessment_guidance: "This topic requires particular sensitivity — follow school and UCL Centre for Holocaust Education guidance." CORRECT and necessary.
- Two external resource links (HET, UCL): both are the standard UK resources for Holocaust education. Excellent.

### 5.3 Contrasting Cases — Are They Well Paired?

**Haiti vs Japan (GE-KS3-CV001 vs CV002):**
- **Pairing quality: 9/10.** This is the standard GCSE and KS3 pairing for tectonic hazards. The contrast works on multiple levels: magnitude (7.0 vs 9.1), deaths (230,000 vs 20,000), development level (LIC vs HIC), hazard type (earthquake only vs earthquake + tsunami + nuclear), preparedness (minimal vs world-leading). The data_points in each vehicle are structured to be directly comparable. This is a textbook contrasting pair.
- **Potential sensitivity:** Haiti is often used as "the poor country" in Geography case studies. There is a risk of portraying Haiti as purely a victim. The vehicle's theme list includes "governance" which helps — it frames vulnerability as a governance failure, not an inherent characteristic of Haitian people. But a sensitivity note about avoiding deficit narratives would be appropriate.

**Lagos vs London (GE-KS3-CV005):**
- **Pairing quality: 8/10.** Good contrast between LIC megacity growth and HIC managed growth. The data_points are structured for comparison. However, Lagos is part of the Nigeria vehicle (CV004) — there is potential confusion about whether Lagos is a development case study or an urbanisation case study. It is both, which is geographically accurate but could confuse planning.

**History vehicles do not use contrasting_with.** This is a missed opportunity. See recommendation 10 above.

### 5.4 Factual Errors Found

| Vehicle | Issue | Severity | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| GE-KS3-CV002 | GDP $5.5 trillion is below the 2011 actual ($6.16 trillion) | Minor | Update to "approximately $6 trillion" |
| GE-KS3-CV001 | 230,000+ deaths is disputed (range: 46,000-316,000) | Moderate | Add data_reliability note |
| GE-KS3-CV008 | "area smaller than Iowa" — UK audience, use UK comparator | Minor | Change to "area smaller than England" (approximately correct) |
| GE-KS3-CV004 | "Boko Haram" in definitions without sensitivity note | Moderate | Add sensitivity note |
| HI-KS3-CV004 | No women in key_figures list | Moderate | Add Pankhurst or a Windrush-era woman |
| HI-KS3-CV003 | "Census data" is vague | Minor | Specify "1851 Census" or "Census data (1801-1901)" |

No major factual errors found. The data is broadly accurate and appropriate for KS3 level. The issues above are refinements, not corrections.

## Part 6: Messages for Colleagues (Updated)

### To Osei (Science):

Good news — the graph now has cross-subject links between our subjects. SC-KS3-C100 (Earth composition) is connected to my GE-KS3-C001 (Plate Tectonics), and SC-KS3-C104 (Carbon cycle) is connected to my GE-KS3-C003 (Climate Change). The rationales are correct: "Same content, different disciplinary lens — must coordinate to avoid repetition."

Can we now actually coordinate? I teach plate tectonics in the Spring term. If you cover Earth's structure in Autumn, I can build on your work. If you teach it after me, you are repeating. The cross-subject links are in the graph; the coordination needs to be in our timetable.

Also: the Thinking Lenses give us a shared vocabulary. I use "Systems and System Models" for plate tectonics; you presumably use the same lens for Earth systems in Science. Does the Science context file assign the same lens? If so, pupils will encounter the same cognitive framework in both subjects. That is powerful.

### To Okonkwo (English):

The graph now connects your EN-Y4-C026 (Drawing inferences with evidence) and EN-Y4-C047 (Organisational devices) to my HI-KS3-C004 (Constructing Historical Arguments). The rationales are useful: "Reading inference skills from English feed into History source interpretation" and "English composition skills feed into History essay writing."

Can we look at this together? My Year 8 pupils are writing 200-word evaluations in Geography and attempting 500-word essays in History. The quality of their argument writing depends on skills they should be developing in English. If your reading comprehension work explicitly teaches "what can we infer from this source?" and your writing composition work explicitly teaches "thesis-evidence-counterevidence structure," then my History and Geography lessons can build on that foundation rather than teaching it from scratch.

### To Henderson (Maths/Data):

The Geography case studies now contain specific data. Haiti: magnitude 7.0, 230,000 deaths, GDP $7 billion, HDI 168/189. Japan: magnitude 9.1, 20,000 deaths, GDP $5.5 trillion. Nigeria: population 220 million, GDP $440 billion, HDI 0.539.

My pupils are working with this data every lesson. They are comparing magnitudes (logarithmic scale), calculating death rates per capita, comparing GDPs, and interpreting HDI scores. Do your Year 8 maths data handling lessons cover: reading and interpreting large numbers (billions, trillions), understanding ratios and rates, interpreting composite indicators? Because that is what I need them to be able to do.

## Conclusion

The graph has improved materially since v4. The Content Vehicles and Thinking Lenses address two of my three top-priority complaints: empty case studies (fixed) and missing cognitive framing (fixed). The third complaint — concept granularity — remains unaddressed and is the most important structural limitation for mastery tracking and diagnostic assessment.

**If I had to summarise the current state:** The graph is now a useful curriculum planning tool for KS3 Humanities. It was not useful for planning in v4; it is in v5. A teacher with 14 years' experience can plan a 3-week cross-curricular unit from the graph data and produce lessons that are geographically and historically rigorous. That is real progress.

**What it cannot yet do:** Generate a full year of KS3 Geography or History content. The coverage is approximately 60% for Geography (missing rivers, coasts, glaciation, weather, economic sectors) and approximately 50% for History (missing Reformation, Industrial Revolution as standalone, World Wars). The concept model is too coarse for adaptive learning systems that need to track mastery at a granular level.

**What it does do well:** Cross-subject connections, cognitive framing through Thinking Lenses, contrasting case study pairs, source material with typed classifications and multiple perspectives, assessment guidance with success criteria. These are the features that distinguish this graph from a flat curriculum document. They add pedagogical value.

**Net assessment:** From a curriculum map that could generate diagnostic questions (v4) to a curriculum framework that can support lesson planning (v5). Not yet a content generation engine — that requires resources, finer concept granularity, and richer vehicle data. But significantly closer.
