# KS3 Humanities — 3-Week Cross-Curricular Unit Plan

**Teacher:** Ms Folake Adeyemi
**Class:** Year 8 (mixed attainment, 30 pupils)
**Term:** Spring Term, Weeks 4-6
**Duration:** 3 weeks, 15 lessons (5 x 50 min/week — 3 Geography, 2 History on my timetable)
**Unit title:** Forces That Shape Our World — Tectonic Hazards and Medieval Power

---

## Unit Overview

This is a cross-curricular unit that uses the new Content Vehicle layer to drive lesson content. Weeks 1-2 are Geography: the Haiti 2010 earthquake (GE-KS3-CV001) contrasted with the Japan 2011 earthquake and tsunami (GE-KS3-CV002). Week 3 is History: Medieval Britain 1066-1509 (HI-KS3-CV001). The contrasting case framework and the Thinking Lenses provide the intellectual architecture.

**Why this pairing works:** The Geography unit asks "why does the same physical hazard produce different human outcomes?" — the answer is development, governance, infrastructure. The History unit asks "how did power shift from the monarch to the people?" — the answer is through crisis, conflict, and institutional change. Both units are about how human systems respond to forces beyond their control. The cross-subject CO_TEACHES link between GE-KS3-C002 (Development) and HI-KS3-C002 (Empire) means I can thread the idea of structural inequality through both subjects.

| Week | Subject | Focus | Vehicle | Lessons |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Geography | Haiti Earthquake — tectonics, vulnerability, aid | GE-KS3-CV001 | L1-L5 |
| 2 | Geography | Japan Earthquake — contrast, preparedness, cascading hazards | GE-KS3-CV002 | L6-L10 |
| 3 | History | Medieval Britain — Conquest, Magna Carta, Black Death, power | HI-KS3-CV001 | L11-L15 |

## Thinking Lenses for This Unit

Each cluster has a primary and secondary Thinking Lens assigned by the graph. I am using these to frame enquiry questions and structure pupil thinking.

| Cluster | Primary Lens | Secondary Lens | My Framing |
|---|---|---|---|
| GE-KS3-D003-CL001 (Tectonics) | Systems and System Models | Stability and Change | The Earth as a system; plate boundaries as zones of instability |
| GE-KS3-D003-CL002 (Development) | Cause and Effect | Systems and System Models | Why did the same hazard produce different outcomes? Multi-factor causation |
| HI-KS3-D001-CL001 (Power/Democracy) | Continuity and Change Over Time | Cause and Effect | What changed, what stayed the same, and why? |

## WEEK 1: THE HAITI EARTHQUAKE — When the Ground Shakes in a Poor Country

### Vehicle: GE-KS3-CV001 — Haiti 2010 Earthquake

**Vehicle data I am using:**
- Location: Port-au-Prince, Haiti
- Data points: Magnitude 7.0, 230,000+ deaths, 1.5 million displaced, GDP $7 billion, HDI rank 168/189
- Themes: vulnerability, development, governance, international aid effectiveness
- Map types: tectonic plate boundary map, GIS hazard overlay, population density map, aid distribution map
- Data sources: USGS, World Bank, UN OCHA, Red Cross
- Contrasting with: GE-KS3-CV002 (Japan)
- Thinking Lens (primary): Systems and System Models
- Thinking Lens (for Lesson 4-5): Cause and Effect (from CL002, because we bridge into development)

**Enquiry question:** Why did the Haiti earthquake kill so many people?

### Lesson 1: The Earth Machine — Plate Tectonics as a System

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | GE-KS3-C001 (Plate Tectonics and Geological Processes) |
| **Vehicle** | GE-KS3-CV001 (Haiti — context setting only) |
| **Thinking Lens** | Systems and System Models (primary for CL001) |
| **Skills** | GE-KS3-C007 — atlas work, diagram interpretation; GS-KS3-001 (Applying maps and atlases) |
| **Type** | New content — introduction |

**Lens question to pupils:** "What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?"

**Teaching approach:** I begin with the Thinking Lens question written on the board: "What are all the parts of the Earth system, and how does A affect B?" Introduce Earth's internal structure as a system with components (crust, mantle, outer core, inner core) that interact. Use the egg analogy but push beyond it — an egg is static, the Earth is dynamic. Convection currents in the mantle are the engine of the system; tectonic plates are the moving parts. I draw a systems diagram on the board: heat from the core drives convection, convection moves plates, plate movement creates hazards. Pupils copy and annotate this diagram.

Quick atlas task: locate and label the major tectonic plates on a world map. Use the USGS data (from CV001 data_sources) to show a map of earthquake epicentres. Ask: "What patterns can you see?" This previews the Patterns lens even though I am primarily using Systems here.

The Haiti earthquake is introduced as a teaser only: show Port-au-Prince on the map. "This city was destroyed in 2010. By the end of this week, you will be able to explain exactly why."

**Key vocabulary:** crust, mantle, convection current, tectonic plate, system, interaction, component (from concept GE-KS3-C001 plus the Systems lens vocabulary)

### Lesson 2: Where Plates Meet — Boundaries and Hazards

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | GE-KS3-C001 |
| **Vehicle** | GE-KS3-CV001 (Haiti — conservative boundary), GE-KS3-CV002 (Japan — subduction zone, previewed) |
| **Thinking Lens** | Stability and Change (secondary for CL001) |
| **Skills** | GE-KS3-C007 — diagram interpretation, annotated sketching; GS-KS3-006 (Analysing data) |
| **Type** | New content |

**Lens question:** "What keeps the Earth's surface stable, and what causes sudden, violent change?"

**Teaching approach:** Three types of plate boundary: convergent (subduction), divergent, conservative (transform). For each: what happens physically, what landforms/hazards result, one real example. I spend extra time on the conservative boundary because that is what caused the Haiti earthquake — the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault zone. The vehicle data specifies "conservative boundary" in its definitions list, so I use Haiti's specific tectonic setting.

I also briefly introduce subduction because CV002 (Japan) requires understanding of the subduction zone that generated the tsunami. This is deliberate foreshadowing.

**Stability and Change framing:** Plate interiors are stable — London does not have earthquakes because it sits in the middle of the Eurasian plate. But at boundaries, stress accumulates until it is released suddenly. This is the conceptual foundation for understanding why earthquakes are unpredictable and sudden.

Address the misconception from the concept description: plates move at centimetres per year, not at speeds you can observe. The system is stable most of the time; change is sudden and catastrophic.

**Key vocabulary:** convergent, divergent, conservative, subduction, fault, epicentre, focus, stress, release (from GE-KS3-C001 + CV001 definitions)

---

### Lesson 3: 12 January 2010, 4:53pm — The Haiti Earthquake

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | GE-KS3-C001, GE-KS3-C002 (co-teach: tectonics + development) |
| **Vehicle** | GE-KS3-CV001 — full deployment |
| **Thinking Lens** | Cause and Effect (primary for CL002, activated here because we bridge into development) |
| **Skills** | GE-KS3-C007 — data interpretation, map work; GS-KS3-003 (GIS), GS-KS3-006 (Data analysis) |
| **Type** | Case study — core lesson |

**Lens question:** "What caused this to happen, and how do we know?"

**Teaching approach:** This is the core case study lesson. I deploy the full vehicle data from GE-KS3-CV001.

**Step 1 — Tectonic cause:** Use the tectonic plate boundary map (from CV001 map_types) to show the Caribbean Plate and North American Plate boundary. The Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault runs directly beneath Port-au-Prince. Magnitude 7.0 at shallow depth (13km). The USGS data (from CV001 data_sources) provides the seismographic evidence.

**Step 2 — Impact data:** Deploy the data_points from CV001:
- 230,000+ deaths
- 1.5 million displaced
- GDP $7 billion (for context: that is less than the GDP of the city of Sheffield)
- HDI rank 168/189

I present these as a data table and ask pupils to annotate: "What does each number tell us?"

**Step 3 — Population density map:** Use the map_types entry "population density map" — Port-au-Prince has 2.5 million people concentrated in an area with minimal building regulations. The population density map overlaid with the earthquake epicentre shows why the death toll was so high. This is where the GIS hazard overlay (another CV001 map_type) becomes relevant — hazard risk overlapping with population concentration.

**Step 4 — Writing frame:** Pupils write a structured paragraph using the Cause and Effect lens: "The Haiti earthquake was caused by... The effects were severe because..." I explicitly teach the "if... then... because..." construction from the Cause and Effect agent_prompt.

**Key vocabulary:** epicentre, magnitude, vulnerability, GDP, HDI, data, evidence (from CV001 definitions + Cause and Effect lens)

---

### Lesson 4: Why Haiti, Not Havana? — Vulnerability and Development

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | GE-KS3-C002 (Global Development and Inequality), GE-KS3-C001 (co-teach) |
| **Vehicle** | GE-KS3-CV001 — themes: vulnerability, development, governance |
| **Thinking Lens** | Cause and Effect (primary for CL002) |
| **Skills** | GE-KS3-C007 — evaluating multiple sources; GS-KS3-004 (Geographical enquiry) |
| **Type** | Analysis and evaluation |

**Lens question:** "Is there more than one reason why 230,000 people died?"

**Teaching approach:** This is the pivotal lesson where physical geography meets human geography. The vehicle's themes — vulnerability, development, governance, international aid effectiveness — drive the structure.

I pose the puzzle: Cuba had a similar earthquake in 1947 with far fewer deaths. Why? Haiti and Cuba sit on the same tectonic boundary. The physical hazard is the same. The difference is human.

**Four causes of vulnerability (drawn from CV001 themes and GE-KS3-C002 concept description):**
1. **Development** — GDP $7 billion, HDI 168/189. Poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. No money for earthquake-resistant buildings, no seismic monitoring network.
2. **Governance** — Decades of political instability, corruption, weak state institutions. Building codes existed on paper but were never enforced.
3. **Urbanisation** — 2.5 million people in Port-au-Prince, many in poorly constructed informal settlements on hillsides. Population pressure (CO_TEACHES link to C004).
4. **Historical factors** — Colonial legacy (French colony, sugar plantations, slave revolt, debt to France). This connects directly to the cross-subject CO_TEACHES link: GE-KS3-C002 (Development) to HI-KS3-C002 (Empire).

**Activity:** Card sort — give pupils 12 factor cards (physical and human) and ask them to arrange on a spectrum from "physical cause" to "human cause." Then rank the top 3 reasons for the high death toll. Most pupils will conclude that human factors mattered more than physical factors. This is the key geographical insight.

**I flag the cross-subject link explicitly:** "When we start History next week, you will learn about how powerful countries have conquered and exploited weaker ones for centuries. Haiti's poverty is not an accident — it has a history. Remember that."

**Key vocabulary:** vulnerability, resilience, governance, infrastructure, building codes, development indicator, human factors, physical factors

### Lesson 5: Did the Aid Work? — Evaluating the International Response

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | GE-KS3-C002, GE-KS3-C001 |
| **Vehicle** | GE-KS3-CV001 — theme: international aid effectiveness; data sources: UN OCHA, Red Cross |
| **Thinking Lens** | Evidence and Argument (from GE-KS3-D004-CL001 — skills cluster) |
| **Skills** | GE-KS3-C007 — evaluating evidence, constructing arguments; GS-KS3-004 (Enquiry using complex sources) |
| **Type** | Evaluation and extended writing |

**Lens question:** "What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?"

**Teaching approach:** I shift to the Evidence and Argument lens because this lesson is about evaluating claims using data. The CV001 assessment_guidance asks: "Can pupils evaluate the effectiveness of international response using data?"

**Deploy the aid distribution map** (from CV001 map_types). The Red Cross raised $488 million for Haiti. The UN deployed MINUSTAH. NGOs flooded in. But ten years later, many displaced people were still in camps. Cholera was introduced by UN peacekeepers, killing 10,000+.

**Structured debate:** "The international aid response to the Haiti earthquake was effective." For and against, using evidence from the data_sources (UN OCHA, Red Cross reports, World Bank assessments).

**Assessment:** I use the CV001 success_criteria as my mark scheme scaffold:
- Explain the tectonic cause of the Haiti earthquake (physical geography knowledge)
- Analyse why Haiti was particularly vulnerable (physical + human factors)
- Evaluate the effectiveness of international aid using data
- Compare impacts and responses with a contrasting HIC earthquake (this prepares for Week 2)

Pupils write a 200-word evaluation: "How effective was the international response to the Haiti earthquake? Use evidence to support your argument."

**Key vocabulary:** evidence, reliability, evaluation, aid, NGO, effectiveness, data, argument (from CV001 + Evidence and Argument lens)

## WEEK 2: THE JAPAN EARTHQUAKE — When the Ground Shakes in a Rich Country

### Vehicle: GE-KS3-CV002 — Japan 2011 Earthquake and Tsunami

**Vehicle data I am using:**
- Location: Tohoku region, Japan
- Data points: Magnitude 9.1, c.20,000 deaths, Tsunami wave height up to 40m, GDP $5.5 trillion, Fukushima nuclear meltdown
- Themes: preparedness, resilience, technology, cascading hazards
- Map types: tectonic plate boundary map, tsunami inundation map, population density map, nuclear exclusion zone
- Data sources: USGS, Japan Meteorological Agency, IAEA, World Bank
- Contrasting with: GE-KS3-CV001 (Haiti)

**Enquiry question:** Can technology save us from tectonic hazards?

---

### Lesson 6: Subduction — When One Plate Goes Under Another

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | GE-KS3-C001 |
| **Vehicle** | GE-KS3-CV002 — subduction zone mechanics |
| **Thinking Lens** | Systems and System Models (primary for CL001) |
| **Skills** | GE-KS3-C007 — diagram work, map interpretation; GS-KS3-001 (Maps and atlases) |
| **Type** | New content — extending understanding |

**Lens question:** "What are all the parts of the subduction system, and what happens when the Pacific Plate meets the North American Plate?"

**Teaching approach:** Return to the Systems lens. In Week 1 we studied a conservative boundary (Haiti — plates sliding past each other). Now we study a convergent boundary — the Pacific Plate subducting beneath the North American Plate off the coast of Japan. This is a more complex system: denser oceanic plate descends, creating a deep ocean trench (Japan Trench), generating earthquakes at depth, and — critically — displacing water to create tsunamis.

Use an animated cross-section diagram to show the subduction process. Explain why subduction zones produce the world's most powerful earthquakes (the magnitude 9.1 from CV002 data_points, compared to Haiti's 7.0). Address the misconception from GE-KS3-C001: the Richter scale is logarithmic — the Japan earthquake released approximately 700 times more energy than Haiti's.

**Map work:** Pupils locate the Japan Trench on the tectonic plate boundary map (CV002 map_type). They annotate the location of the epicentre relative to the coast and explain why a tsunami was generated.

**Key vocabulary:** subduction zone, oceanic plate, continental plate, trench, tsunami, logarithmic scale (from CV002 definitions)

---

### Lesson 7: 11 March 2011, 2:46pm — The Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | GE-KS3-C001, GE-KS3-C002 (co-teach) |
| **Vehicle** | GE-KS3-CV002 — full deployment |
| **Thinking Lens** | Stability and Change (secondary for CL001) |
| **Skills** | GE-KS3-C007 — data interpretation, GIS; GS-KS3-003 (GIS), GS-KS3-006 (Data analysis) |
| **Type** | Case study — core lesson |

**Lens question:** "What keeps Japan stable most of the time, and what caused everything to change in minutes?"

**Teaching approach:** Deploy the full CV002 data. Japan experiences approximately 1,500 earthquakes per year — most cause no damage because of building standards and preparedness. Japan is "stable" in its daily life despite sitting on one of the most tectonically active zones on Earth. But on 11 March 2011, the system tipped.

**Data deployment (from CV002 data_points):**
- Magnitude 9.1 — the fourth most powerful earthquake ever recorded
- Tsunami wave height up to 40m — higher than a 10-storey building
- c.20,000 deaths — despite advanced preparedness

Use the tsunami inundation map (CV002 map_type) to show how far inland the wave reached. Use the population density map to show the coastal communities that were in the path.

**Video evidence:** Show carefully selected footage of the tsunami crossing farmland (widely available educational footage). This is visceral and makes the data real. Address pupil reactions sensitively.

**Stability and Change framing:** Japan had invested billions in earthquake preparedness. Seismometers, early warning systems, earthquake drills in every school, building codes among the strictest in the world. All of that worked — for the earthquake. But the tsunami overwhelmed everything. The system's defences had a threshold, and this event exceeded it.

**Key vocabulary:** tsunami, inundation, seismometer, early warning system, preparedness, threshold (from CV002 definitions + Stability and Change lens)

---

### Lesson 8: Fukushima — When Hazards Cascade

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | GE-KS3-C001, GE-KS3-C003 (co-teach: tectonics + environmental) |
| **Vehicle** | GE-KS3-CV002 — theme: cascading hazards; data point: Fukushima nuclear meltdown |
| **Thinking Lens** | Systems and System Models |
| **Skills** | GE-KS3-C007 — evaluating evidence; GS-KS3-004 (Enquiry using complex sources) |
| **Type** | Case study extension — systems thinking |

**Lens question:** "What happened when one component of the system failed?"

**Teaching approach:** The Fukushima nuclear meltdown is the defining example of a cascading hazard. The earthquake damaged the power supply. The tsunami overwhelmed the backup generators. Without cooling, the reactor cores overheated and melted down. Each failure caused the next.

Use the nuclear exclusion zone map (CV002 map_type) to show the 20km evacuation zone. 154,000 people evacuated. Farmland contaminated. The data_point "Fukushima nuclear meltdown" in CV002 is deliberately listed alongside tectonic data because the graph treats it as an outcome of the tectonic event, not a separate incident.

**Systems diagram:** Pupils create a flow diagram showing the cascade: Earthquake damages power supply, Tsunami destroys backup generators, Cooling system fails, Reactor meltdown, Radiation release, Evacuation. I ask: "At which point could the cascade have been stopped? What would have needed to be different?" This is genuine systems thinking.

**CV002 success criterion addressed:** "Explain what 'cascading hazard' means using the Fukushima example."

**Key vocabulary:** cascading hazard, nuclear meltdown, exclusion zone, backup system, failure cascade (from CV002 definitions)

---

### Lesson 9: Haiti vs Japan — The Great Comparison

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | GE-KS3-C001, GE-KS3-C002 (co-teach) |
| **Vehicles** | GE-KS3-CV001 AND GE-KS3-CV002 — contrasting_with relationship |
| **Thinking Lens** | Cause and Effect (primary for CL002) |
| **Skills** | GE-KS3-C007 — data comparison, argument construction; GS-KS3-006 (Data analysis) |
| **Type** | Comparative analysis — the central geographical lesson |

**Lens question:** "What caused the difference in outcomes between Haiti and Japan?"

**Teaching approach:** This is THE lesson. The entire two-week unit builds to this comparison. The contrasting_with relationship between CV001 and CV002 is the structural backbone.

**Data comparison table** (all from vehicle data_points):

| | Haiti 2010 | Japan 2011 |
|---|---|---|
| Magnitude | 7.0 | 9.1 |
| Deaths | 230,000+ | c.20,000 |
| GDP | $7 billion | $5.5 trillion |
| HDI rank | 168/189 | 19/189 |
| Key feature | Conservative boundary | Subduction + tsunami |
| Additional hazard | Cholera (from aid response) | Fukushima nuclear meltdown |

The paradox is immediate: the weaker earthquake killed 10 times more people. Why?

**Structured comparison activity:** Pupils work in pairs. Each pair gets a comparison grid. They must identify at least 3 physical factors and 3 human factors that explain the difference. The Cause and Effect lens pushes them beyond listing: "Is there more than one reason? Which reason matters most?"

I draw out the key geographical principle: **it is not the hazard that kills people; it is the vulnerability.** Development level, governance quality, building standards, early warning systems, healthcare capacity — these human factors determine the impact of a physical event. This is the Cause and Effect lens at its most powerful.

**Key vocabulary:** comparison, contrast, vulnerability, resilience, HIC, LIC, development, preparedness, governance

---

### Lesson 10: Assessment — "Natural Disasters Are Not Natural"

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | All Geography concepts covered in Weeks 1-2 |
| **Vehicles** | GE-KS3-CV001, GE-KS3-CV002 |
| **Thinking Lens** | Evidence and Argument |
| **Skills** | All — assessment |
| **Type** | Summative assessment |

**Assessment structure (50 minutes):**

**Section A — Knowledge (10 marks, 10 min)**
1. Draw a labelled diagram of a subduction zone. (4 marks)
2. Define "magnitude" and "epicentre." (2 marks)
3. Give two data points from the Haiti earthquake and explain what each tells us about the impact. (4 marks) [Uses CV001 data_points directly]

**Section B — Data Skills (10 marks, 10 min)**
4. Study the data table comparing Haiti and Japan. Describe two differences in the impacts and suggest a reason for each. (6 marks) [Uses both vehicle data_points]
5. Study the map showing the tsunami inundation zone. Describe the pattern and explain why coastal communities were most affected. (4 marks) [Uses CV002 map_types]

**Section C — Extended Writing (15 marks, 30 min)**
6. "'Natural disasters' are not natural — they are caused by human decisions." Using your case studies of Haiti and Japan, how far do you agree? (15 marks)

This question synthesises both vehicles. The CV001 success_criteria ("Compare impacts and responses with a contrasting HIC earthquake") and CV002 success_criteria ("Compare Japan's preparedness and outcomes with Haiti's") are both assessed here. The Evidence and Argument lens drives the structure: claims must be supported by specific data from the case studies.

## WEEK 3: MEDIEVAL BRITAIN — When Power Belonged to One Man

### Vehicle: HI-KS3-CV001 — Medieval Britain 1066-1509

**Vehicle data I am using:**
- Period: 1066-1509
- Key figures: William the Conqueror, Thomas Becket, King John, Simon de Montfort, Henry VII
- Key events: Norman Conquest 1066, Murder of Becket 1170, Magna Carta 1215, Black Death 1348-49, Peasants' Revolt 1381, Battle of Bosworth 1485
- Sources: Bayeux Tapestry, Magna Carta, Domesday Book, Chronicles of Jean Froissart
- Source types: primary visual, primary legal, primary administrative, primary written
- Perspectives: Norman lord, Saxon peasant, medieval monk, merchant, peasant rebel
- Thinking Lens (primary): Continuity and Change Over Time
- Thinking Lens (secondary): Cause and Effect

**Enquiry question:** Who really had power in Medieval England?

---

### Lesson 11: 1066 — Conquest and Control

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | HI-KS3-C001 (Power, Monarchy and Democracy) |
| **Vehicle** | HI-KS3-CV001 — key event: Norman Conquest 1066; key figure: William the Conqueror |
| **Thinking Lens** | Continuity and Change Over Time (primary for HI-KS3-D001-CL001) |
| **Skills** | HI-KS3-C004 (Historical Arguments); HT-001 (Chronological understanding), HT-002 (Causation and consequence) |
| **Source** | Bayeux Tapestry (from CV001 sources — "primary visual") |
| **Type** | New content — period introduction |

**Lens question:** "What changed when William conquered England? What stayed the same?"

**Teaching approach:** I start with the Bayeux Tapestry — the first source listed in CV001. Not a photograph, not a painting, but a 70-metre embroidered narrative of the Norman Conquest. It is a primary visual source, and the vehicle correctly types it as such (source_types: "primary visual").

I use three panels: Harold's oath to William, the Battle of Hastings, Harold's death. Pupils describe what they see before I explain the context. Then I ask: "Who made this tapestry? Why? Can we trust it?" This activates the Perspective and Interpretation lens (secondary for CL002 but useful here for source work).

The Continuity and Change question: After 1066, what changed? (Language — French in court; land ownership — Norman lords replaced Saxon ones; castles — motte and bailey, then stone keeps; the Church — Norman bishops). What stayed the same? (The peasants still farmed; the Church still existed; the basic feudal structure was similar to what came before). William did not invent feudalism — he systematised it.

**CV001 perspective deployed:** The "Norman lord" perspective — William rewarded his followers with land. The "Saxon peasant" perspective — dispossession, the Harrying of the North, a new French-speaking ruling class.

**Key vocabulary:** conquest, feudalism, Domesday Book, motte and bailey, Norman, Saxon (from CV001 definitions)

---

### Lesson 12: The Domesday Book — How William Knew Everything

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | HI-KS3-C001 |
| **Vehicle** | HI-KS3-CV001 — source: Domesday Book ("primary administrative") |
| **Thinking Lens** | Evidence and Argument (from HI-KS3-D003-CL001) |
| **Skills** | HI-KS3-C004; HT-006 (Historical evidence) |
| **Type** | Source analysis |

**Lens question:** "What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?"

**Teaching approach:** The Domesday Book is the second great source from CV001 (source_types: "primary administrative"). It is the first nationwide survey of land and resources in English history — commissioned by William in 1085, completed in 1086.

I give pupils a simplified extract showing entries for a specific manor: who held the land before 1066 (a Saxon thegn), who holds it now (a Norman baron), how many ploughs, how many peasants, what it is worth. They read the data and answer: "What can we learn about how the Conquest changed this place?"

**Evidence and Argument framing:** The Domesday Book is administratively reliable — William needed accurate tax records. But it records what the king wanted to know, not what peasants wanted to say. What is missing? The lived experience of ordinary people. The source tells us about power and wealth; it tells us nothing about feelings, resistance, or suffering. This is a key historical insight about the nature of administrative sources.

**Cross-subject connection to Geography:** I make the link explicit: "The Domesday Book is essentially the first GIS database in English history — a spatial survey of who owned what, where. When you studied the population density map in Geography, you were using modern technology to do what William did with parchment and ink."

**Key vocabulary:** Domesday Book, survey, assessment, land tenure, administrative source, provenance (from CV001 definitions)

---

### Lesson 13: Magna Carta — Did It Change Anything?

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | HI-KS3-C001 |
| **Vehicle** | HI-KS3-CV001 — source: Magna Carta ("primary legal"); key figure: King John; key event: Magna Carta 1215 |
| **Thinking Lens** | Continuity and Change Over Time |
| **Skills** | HI-KS3-C004; HT-003 (Change and continuity), HT-005 (Historical significance) |
| **Type** | Source analysis + significance evaluation |

**Lens question:** "What changed because of Magna Carta? Was it a turning point or a false start?"

**Teaching approach:** Magna Carta is the most famous source in CV001. The concept description for HI-KS3-C001 flags the key misconception: "Pupils may present Magna Carta as establishing democracy; in reality it was a document protecting baronial privilege."

I show a photograph of the document itself. Then I read simplified versions of key clauses. Clause 39: "No free man shall be seized or imprisoned except by the lawful judgement of his equals." Clause 40: "To no one will we sell, to no one deny or delay right or justice."

**Two questions:**
1. Who was this written for? (Barons. Not peasants. Not women. Not serfs. The document protects the rights of the powerful against the king.)
2. Why does it matter today? (Because later generations reinterpreted it as a universal statement of rights. The American Constitution cites it. The UN references it.)

**CV001 perspectives deployed:** "Medieval monk" — the Church saw Magna Carta as protecting its independence from royal interference. "Saxon peasant" — it changed nothing for them in 1215; they were not "free men" in the legal sense.

**Continuity and Change framing:** In 1215, Magna Carta was a failure — John repudiated it within months, and the Pope annulled it. It was reissued after John's death. Its significance grew over centuries as people used it to argue for broader rights. This is the key insight: significance can change over time.

**CV001 assessment criterion addressed:** "Evaluate the significance of Magna Carta with evidence."

**Key vocabulary:** Magna Carta, charter, clause, rights, precedent, significance, reinterpretation (from CV001 definitions)

---

### Lesson 14: The Black Death — When Death Changed Everything

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | HI-KS3-C001 |
| **Vehicle** | HI-KS3-CV001 — key event: Black Death 1348-49; source: Chronicles of Jean Froissart ("primary written"); perspective: "peasant rebel" |
| **Thinking Lens** | Cause and Effect (secondary for CL001) |
| **Skills** | HI-KS3-C004; HT-002 (Causation and consequence) |
| **Type** | Causal analysis |

**Lens question:** "What caused the Black Death, and what were its consequences for power in England?"

**Teaching approach:** The Black Death killed an estimated 40-60% of the English population between 1348 and 1350. I use the Chronicles of Jean Froissart (CV001 sources — "primary written") as an eyewitness account: descriptions of the plague, the breakdown of social order, the overwhelming number of dead.

**Cause and Effect chain:**
1. Plague arrives via trade routes (Cause: globalisation before the word existed)
2. Population drops by 40-60% (Immediate effect)
3. Labour shortage — surviving peasants can demand higher wages (Economic consequence)
4. Statute of Labourers 1351 — government tries to freeze wages (Political response)
5. Peasants' Revolt 1381 — Wat Tyler marches on London (Rebellion)
6. Serfdom gradually disappears — by 1500, most English peasants are free (Long-term change)

**CV001 perspective deployed:** "Peasant rebel" — the Black Death created the conditions for the Peasants' Revolt. For the first time, ordinary people had economic leverage and used it. This is where the "Saxon peasant" becomes the "peasant rebel" — the vehicle explicitly includes both perspectives because the medieval period transforms one into the other.

**Cross-subject link to Geography:** "The Black Death spread along trade routes — the same routes that connected medieval Europe to Asia. When you studied globalisation and migration in Geography, you learned that connections between places bring both opportunities and risks. The Black Death is the medieval version of that lesson."

**CV001 success criterion addressed:** "Explain how the Black Death caused social and economic change."

**Key vocabulary:** Black Death, plague, mortality, labour shortage, Peasants' Revolt, serfdom, consequence (from CV001 definitions + Cause and Effect lens)

### Lesson 15: Assessment — Who Really Had Power?

| | |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** | HI-KS3-C001, HI-KS3-C004 |
| **Vehicle** | HI-KS3-CV001 — full assessment using success criteria |
| **Thinking Lens** | Continuity and Change Over Time + Evidence and Argument |
| **Skills** | All History skills |
| **Type** | Summative assessment |

**Assessment structure (50 minutes):**

**Section A — Chronology and Knowledge (10 marks, 10 min)**
1. Place these events in chronological order: Black Death, Battle of Bosworth, Norman Conquest, Magna Carta, Peasants' Revolt, Murder of Becket. (3 marks) [Uses CV001 key_events]
2. Name two key figures from Medieval Britain and explain their significance. (4 marks) [Uses CV001 key_figures]
3. Define "feudalism" and explain how it organised power in Medieval England. (3 marks) [Uses CV001 definitions]

**Section B — Source Analysis (10 marks, 15 min)**
4. Study Source A [extract from the Bayeux Tapestry panel showing Harold's death]. What can we learn from this source about the Norman Conquest? What are the limitations of this source? (6 marks) [Uses CV001 sources + source_types]
5. Study Source B [simplified extract from Magna Carta]. Who was this document written for? Explain why its significance has changed over time. (4 marks)

**Section C — Extended Writing (15 marks, 25 min)**
6. "Power shifted from the monarch to the people between 1066 and 1509." How far do you agree? Use evidence from the events, sources and people you have studied to support your argument. (15 marks)

This directly addresses CV001 success criterion 1: "Construct a sustained argument about change in power 1066-1509." The Continuity and Change lens structures the answer: pupils must identify what changed (Magna Carta, the Peasants' Revolt, the decline of serfdom) and what stayed the same (the king still had enormous power in 1509; Parliament was still a tool of the elite).
