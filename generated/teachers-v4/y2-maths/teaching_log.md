## Lesson 1 (Monday): Counting in 2s and 5s -- revision and extension

### What happened
Started the year with this diagnostic lesson. Choral counting in 2s went well -- nearly all children were secure to 20 from Year 1 (prerequisite MA-Y1-C002 confirmed for most). Extending to 100 stretched them but the rhythm carried it. Counting in 5s was similarly solid.

The hundred square shading was the highlight. When I asked "What patterns can you notice?" (Patterns lens, MA-Y2-D001-CL001 primary lens), the children immediately spotted the column pattern for 5s (whole columns shaded) and the diagonal pattern for 2s. Three children described the 2s pattern as "every other number" which is exactly the language that bridges to odd/even on Wednesday.

### What went well
- The Patterns lens question ("What patterns can you notice? What do they let you predict?") generated genuine mathematical talk. Liam predicted that the 2s pattern would "keep going the same way forever" -- early generalisation.
- Starting with revision built confidence on Day 1. No child was lost.
- The hundred square visual made abstract counting sequences concrete and spatial.

### What I would adjust
- I underestimated how long the hundred square shading would take. Some children had not finished when I needed to move to the plenary. Next time, pre-shade the first two rows and ask children to continue.
- The differentiation for above-expected (counting from non-zero multiples) was too easy. They finished in 3 minutes. Need a more challenging extension -- perhaps "Can you find a number that appears in BOTH the 2s and 5s sequences?" (leads to multiples of 10).

### Children needing intervention
- **Priya** and **Zain** struggled with counting in 2s beyond 20. Both were counting by adding 2 each time rather than recognising the sequence. They need concrete support (Numicon tiles in pairs) before Tuesday.
- No concerns with 5s for any child.

### How the graph data helped
- The prerequisite chain (MA-Y1-C002 -> MA-Y2-C001) told me exactly what to check in the diagnostic. I knew that fluent counting in multiples of 2, 5 and 10 from Year 1 was the entry point, and I could check it cleanly.
- The teaching guidance for C001 was spot-on about starting from 0 and extending to non-zero multiples. I did not need to invent this -- it was there.
- **What was missing:** No Content Vehicle for this cluster. CV001 (Place Value with Dienes) does not cover counting sequences. I was planning from the concept teaching guidance alone, which is fine for an experienced teacher but would leave an AI or NQT without structured CPA support. The Patterns lens was useful as a prompt but it is quite generic -- the same question serves a Y2 counting lesson and a Y9 algebra lesson.

## Lesson 2 (Tuesday): Counting in 3s -- new learning

### What happened
This was the genuinely new content and it was noticeably harder. The C001 teaching guidance flagged that "counting in threes is harder than twos and fives because the digit pattern is less obvious" -- completely correct. Making groups of 3 cubes on the carpet worked well as the concrete introduction, but when we moved to choral counting from 0, the class fell apart after 12. The decade-boundary error (C001 common misconception: "after 18, pupils often say 20 or 19 instead of 21") hit exactly as predicted. At least 10 children said "20" instead of "21."

The hundred square shading was revealing. Unlike the neat columns of 5s, the 3s pattern zigzags irregularly across the grid. I used the Patterns lens: "Is this pattern as neat as the 2s or 5s? Why not?" Several children said "because 3 doesn't fit into 10 properly" which is surprisingly close to a statement about divisibility.

### What went well
- The graph's misconception data for C001 was directly useful. Because I knew the decade-boundary error would happen, I addressed it proactively: "After 18, what do you think most people say by mistake? 20! But 18 + 3 is actually 21." This pre-emptive framing reduced the error rate.
- Physical cubes (groups of 3) gave a solid concrete foundation before abstract counting.
- The Patterns lens question generated genuine comparison between sequences -- children were noticing that different step sizes create different visual patterns.

### What I would adjust
- Backward counting in 3s was too ambitious for Day 2. The teaching guidance says "backward counting in steps of 3 is substantially harder than forwards and requires targeted practice" -- I should have heeded this more seriously. I will return to backward 3s on Friday rather than pushing it today.
- Need more time on the 18->21 transition specifically. Will create a targeted activity: "What comes next? 12, 15, 18, __" as a starter for the rest of the week.

### Children needing intervention
- **Priya** and **Zain** (flagged yesterday) still need support on 2s; they cannot layer 3s on top. I worked with them at the cubes station for 5 minutes and they could count in 3s to 12 with objects but not beyond.
- **Aiden** counted in 3s from 3 instead of 0 -- this is listed in C001 misconceptions ("Some pupils count in threes starting at 3 rather than 0, producing the correct sequence but starting at the wrong place"). He needs the explicit starting-point instruction.
- About 12 children are insecure beyond 21 in 3s. This is expected for Day 1 of new content.

### How the graph data helped
- The C001 misconception about decade-boundary errors was the single most useful piece of data this lesson. Without it, I might not have pre-empted the error so explicitly.
- The teaching guidance suggestion to "use hundred squares with every third square shaded" was the right activity.
- **What was missing:** The graph tells me that counting in 3s "is introduced specifically to support pupils' later understanding of a third as a fraction" but does not give me a way to make that connection concrete TODAY. In my v4 findings I asked for cross-domain links between counting and fractions -- that link still is not structurally in the graph (the CO_TEACHES link goes from C001 to C008 times tables, not to C012 fractions).

## Lesson 3 (Wednesday): Odd and even numbers

### What happened
Strong lesson. The concrete start -- sharing cubes equally into two groups -- worked brilliantly. Every child could physically determine odd or even for single-digit numbers within 2 minutes. The connection to counting in 2s ("the numbers we land on when counting in 2s from 0 are the even numbers") was the key conceptual bridge, and it landed cleanly because we had practised 2s thoroughly on Monday.

The digit rule (even numbers end in 0, 2, 4, 6, 8) emerged from pattern observation as intended. I asked 8 children to share different quantities and we listed the results on the board. "What pattern can you notice about the even numbers?" (Patterns lens.) Sophie immediately said "they end in the same numbers as counting in 2s" -- exactly the connection I wanted.

Testing with larger numbers (C011 teaching guidance: "they may not know whether larger numbers like 76, 83 are odd or even because they are beyond their memorised list") confirmed that about 20 children had genuinely internalised the digit rule, while 8-10 were still thinking in terms of their memorised list (2, 4, 6, 8, 10...).

The "Is 0 even or odd?" question in the plenary (C011 misconception: "Some pupils classify 0 incorrectly") produced a heated debate. About half the class said even, half said "it's not odd or even because it's nothing." The concrete model resolved it: 0 objects can be shared equally into 2 groups of 0. 0 is even. Three children were visibly surprised.

### What went well
- CPA progression worked naturally even without a Content Vehicle: concrete (cubes), pictorial (hundred square colouring), abstract (digit rule).
- The Patterns lens question produced genuine mathematical reasoning. Children were making and testing conjectures.
- C011 misconception data was accurate -- the three most common errors all appeared.
- The deliberate connection to C001 (counting in 2s) followed the CO_TEACHES relationship (C011 <-> C001, extracted) and it worked as a natural bridge.

### What I would adjust
- I spent too long on the hundred square colouring activity. It confirmed understanding but did not extend it. I should have moved to the larger-number testing sooner, because that is where the actual learning gap was.
- Need to revisit the 0 question tomorrow -- some children were unconvinced and I do not want "0 is special" becoming an embedded misconception.

### Children needing intervention
- **Ethan** and **Maya** are classifying numbers by "feel" rather than applying the digit rule. They said 14 was odd because "it sounds odd." They need more practice with the concrete sharing model.
- **Priya** is still insecure on counting in 2s. She could share objects into two groups, but when I asked "Is 16 even?" she counted in 2s from 0 to check: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16... yes. This is correct but not efficient. She needs the digit rule to stick.

### How the graph data helped
- C011 teaching guidance directed me to start concretely with sharing, then connect to the 2x table, then establish the digit rule -- that exact sequence worked.
- Misconception data caught all three error types that appeared (memorised list, 0 confusion, "sounds odd/even").
- The CO_TEACHES relationship C011 <-> C001 informed my lesson sequencing: counting in 2s before odd/even is not just a nice sequence, it is a pedagogical dependency.
- **What was missing:** I would have liked a Content Vehicle with specific diagnostic questions. The CV001 assessment asks "Can pupils partition any 2-digit number into tens and ones?" but there is no parallel for odd/even. I had to create my own assessment items. The graph's success criteria do not cover D001-CL001 at all -- CV001 only covers CL002.

## Lesson 4 (Thursday): Odd and even patterns -- deeper investigation

### What happened
The investigation lesson. "What happens when you add two even numbers?" Gave pairs of children cubes and a recording table. This was the first touch of MA-Y2-C021 (patterns and sequences) and it pushed the Patterns lens to its fullest: "Can you find a PATTERN? Can you make a RULE? Does your rule ALWAYS work?"

Results:
- Even + even = even: Most pairs found this within 3 examples. Confidence was high.
- Odd + odd = even: This surprised almost every child. They had expected odd + odd = odd. When I asked them to prove it with cubes (each odd number has one left over; two leftovers make a pair), about 12 children could articulate the reasoning. The rest accepted the pattern without fully understanding why.
- Even + odd = odd: Established quickly.

The cubes proof for odd + odd = even was the mathematical highlight of the week. Liam said "It's because the lonely ones find a friend" -- a beautiful informal explanation that captures the essence of the proof.

The extension (does the same rule work for subtraction?) stretched the above-expected group. They found: even - even = even, odd - odd = even, but even - odd = odd and odd - even = odd. The subtraction results mirror the addition results, which is itself a pattern -- though I did not have time to explore why.

### What went well
- The investigation format was age-appropriate and rigorous. Children were generating examples, recording, conjecturing, and testing -- mathematical reasoning (MR-KS1-002, MR-KS1-004) in action.
- The Patterns lens key questions ("What do you notice? Does this always happen?") mapped directly to what I was asking. This is where the lens is at its most useful -- guiding the teacher's questioning.
- The cross-domain CO_TEACHES link between C011 and C008 (times tables, "Even numbers are multiples of 2") is exactly what we were exploring, even though times tables are not formally taught until Spring. The graph's rationale says "Henderson: Connect deliberately when introducing tables." I will.

### What I would adjust
- The recording table took too long to set up. Next time, provide a pre-printed sheet with the table already drawn and example numbers to test.
- I should have asked EVERY pair to test at least 5 examples before stating their rule. Some rushed to a conclusion after 2 examples. The Evidence and Argument lens (secondary for D001-CL003) asks "How many examples do you need?" -- I should have invoked this explicitly.
- The plenary explanation of WHY odd + odd = even using cubes needed more time. I rushed it in 5 minutes. This deserves 10 minutes because it is genuine proof at Year 2 level.

### Children needing intervention
- **Ethan** and **Maya** (flagged yesterday for odd/even) improved today -- the investigation format with cubes gave them more concrete experience and both correctly identified the even + even = even rule. The hands-on work was better for them than the classification task.
- **Aiden** was still starting his 3s counting from 3 instead of 0. I corrected this individually during registration.
- No new concerns.

### How the graph data helped
- C011 teaching guidance mentions the investigation of adding odd/even numbers explicitly. The concept detail is rich enough to plan an investigation lesson without needing to add much.
- C021's description of "continuing, describing and creating repeating patterns and understanding the rule that generates a sequence" maps to what we did, even though we were working with odd/even rather than shape patterns.
- **What was missing:** The Thinking Lens for CL001 lists Cause and Effect as the secondary lens, with the question "What caused this to happen?" For this specific lesson, that framing would have been more powerful than Patterns: "What CAUSES odd + odd to always be even?" prompts the cube proof directly. The lens assignment is at the cluster level, not the lesson level, which means the secondary lens might sometimes be the better choice for individual lessons within the cluster. The AI instruction for the lens is too generic to help here.

## Lesson 5 (Friday): Consolidation and counting assessment

### What happened
Mixed lesson -- part consolidation, part formative assessment. The counting stick work at the start confirmed that most children can now count in 2s and 5s to 100 and in 3s to at least 21. Backward counting in 3s from 30 remains difficult. About 15 children managed it independently; the rest needed the counting stick with numbers visible.

The 15-question written assessment gave me clean data:

| Question type | Class average | Lowest score | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Count in 2s (Q1-3) | 93% | Priya, Zain scored 1/3 | Expected -- these two still need support |
| Count in 3s (Q4-6) | 72% | 8 children scored 0-1/3 | Decade-boundary errors confirmed at scale |
| Count in 5s (Q7-9) | 97% | No concerns | Strongest sequence |
| Odd/even (Q10-15) | 85% | Ethan 3/6, Maya 4/6 | Both misclassified numbers > 50; 0 was correct for 24/30 children |

The 3s counting data is the most important finding. 8 children (27%) scored 0 or 1 out of 3 on 3s, primarily because of the decade-boundary error (18 -> 20 instead of 21). This is a significant minority who need targeted intervention next week, even as the rest of the class moves to place value.

### What went well
- The assessment design (based on C001 and C011 concept specifications) hit the right targets. The 3s questions specifically tested the decade boundary (Q4: "Write the next 3 numbers: 15, 18, __") and this confirmed exactly the misconception the graph predicted.
- Self-marking in the plenary was efficient and motivating. Children could see their own errors immediately.
- Identifying intervention needs for Week 2 is actionable because the assessment is concept-referenced.

### What I would adjust
- The assessment was slightly too long for 10 minutes. Some children did not reach Q14-15. Next time, reduce to 12 questions.
- I should have included a backward counting question to assess that separately. All questions were forward counting.
- The odd/even questions did not include any "explain your reasoning" items. I asked "Is 76 odd or even?" but not "How do you know?" An explanation question would distinguish children who have the digit rule from those using the memorised list.

### Children needing intervention
- **Priya** and **Zain**: 2s still insecure. Will provide Numicon intervention at the start of Weeks 2-3 during soft-start time.
- **8 children** (Aiden, Callum, Grace, Hassan, Isla, Josh, Lucy, Omar): 3s counting not secure, specifically across decade boundaries. Small-group 3s counting practice Tuesdays and Thursdays during assembly time.
- **Ethan** and **Maya**: odd/even for larger numbers. Will pair them with confident children during Week 2 and provide sorting activities.

### How the graph data helped
- The concept-referenced assessment design was entirely driven by the graph data. Each question maps to a specific concept ID and targets a documented misconception.
- The prerequisite chain (Y1 -> Y2) correctly predicted which children would struggle: Priya and Zain had weak Y1 foundations.
- **What was missing:** No CV for CL001. The assessment I created was my own design, not from a Content Vehicle. CV001 begins with C002 (place value), leaving the entire counting/odd-even cluster without structured assessment or success criteria. This is a gap -- if an AI were generating assessment for this cluster, it would have to rely on the concept-level misconceptions and teaching guidance to infer appropriate questions, rather than having structured assessment criteria as it does for CL002 (via CV001).

## Week 1 Summary

### Overall assessment of graph support

| Aspect | Quality | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Concept specifications (C001, C011, C021) | Excellent | Teaching guidance, misconceptions, and vocabulary were accurate and directly usable |
| Prerequisite chains | Excellent | Y1 prerequisites correctly identified the children who struggled |
| CO_TEACHES relationships | Good | C011 <-> C001 correctly informed sequencing; C001 <-> C008 correctly noted for Spring term |
| Thinking Lens (Patterns) | Good but generic | Useful as a questioning framework but the AI instruction is not age-differentiated |
| Content Vehicle | Not available | No CV covers CL001 -- gap for counting/odd-even |
| Success criteria | Not available | CV001 success criteria cover CL002 only |
| Assessment guidance | Not available | Had to create all assessment items from scratch |
| Cluster sequencing | Correct | CL001 before CL002 is right |
| Misconception data | Outstanding | Every misconception I encountered was documented in the graph |

### The Patterns lens in practice
The Patterns lens was the right primary lens for this cluster. The key question ("What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?") maps naturally to counting sequences and odd/even classification. It was most useful in Lesson 4 (investigation) where pattern-spotting was the core mathematical activity. It was least useful in Lesson 2 (counting in 3s) where the issue was procedural accuracy, not pattern recognition -- children needed to count correctly before they could spot patterns.

The AI instruction ("prompt pupils to notice what repeats or follows a rule, classify examples by shared features, identify exceptions, and predict what comes next") is correct but reads as if it were written for a KS3 teacher, not for 6-year-olds. "Classify examples by shared features" is not the language a Year 2 teacher would use. The instruction would benefit from age-specific worked examples: "Ask Year 2: What do you notice? Can you see a pattern? What will come next?"

### The Content Vehicle gap
D001-CL001 has no Content Vehicle. This means:
- No structured CPA progression for counting or odd/even
- No manipulative list (I used cubes and hundred squares from experience)
- No common error list specific to CL001 (I relied on concept-level misconceptions, which were excellent)
- No assessment guidance or success criteria
- No defined vocabulary list beyond the concept-level vocabulary

For Weeks 2-5, Content Vehicles CV001 and CV002 will provide all of this. The contrast will be instructive.
