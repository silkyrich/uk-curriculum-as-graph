# Year 2 Mathematics -- Half-Term Lesson Plan (Autumn 1)

**Teacher:** James Henderson (Maths Lead)
**Class:** Year 2 (ages 6-7), 30 children
**Half-term:** Autumn 1, 6 weeks (30 lessons)
**Domains:** Number and Place Value (MA-Y2-D001), Addition and Subtraction (MA-Y2-D002)
**Content Vehicles used:** MA-Y2-CV001 (Place Value with Dienes Blocks), MA-Y2-CV002 (Addition and Subtraction with Number Lines)
**Thinking Lenses:** Patterns (primary for most clusters), Cause and Effect, Scale/Proportion/Quantity

---

## Planning Rationale

This half-term covers the two foundational number domains for Year 2. The cluster sequence from the graph is:

1. **MA-Y2-D001-CL001** -- Counting sequences and odd/even (introduction) -- Weeks 1-2
2. **MA-Y2-D001-CL002** -- Place value in two-digit numbers (practice) -- Weeks 2-3
3. **MA-Y2-D002-CL001** -- Number facts and two-digit calculation (introduction, keystone) -- Weeks 3-5
4. **MA-Y2-D002-CL002** -- Properties of addition and subtraction (practice) -- Week 5-6
5. **MA-Y2-D001-CL003** -- Patterns and sequences (practice) -- woven through, consolidated Week 6

**Content Vehicles** CV001 and CV002 provide the CPA progressions, manipulatives, common errors, and success criteria that drive the lesson design. Each week's notes reference specific vehicle properties.

**Thinking Lens** framing: The Patterns lens is primary for 4 of 5 clusters. This gives the half-term a unifying question: *"What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?"* I will use this as a recurring stem across all domains. The Scale/Proportion/Quantity lens supports place value and the Cause and Effect lens supports the properties cluster.

## Week 1: Counting Sequences and Odd/Even (D001-CL001)

**Cluster:** MA-Y2-D001-CL001 -- Extend the counting sequence and recognise odd and even numbers
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C001 (Counting in steps of 2, 3, 5), MA-Y2-C011 (Odd and even numbers)
**Thinking Lens:** Patterns (primary)
**Recurring question:** "What patterns can you notice? What do they let you predict?"

### Lesson 1 (Monday): Counting in 2s and 5s -- revision and extension
**Concept:** MA-Y2-C001 | **Type:** Revision/diagnostic

**Starter (5 min):** Quick diagnostic -- every child counts aloud in 2s to 20 and in 5s to 50 with a partner. I circulate to identify children still insecure from Y1. (Prerequisite check: MA-Y1-C002.)

**Main teaching (15 min):** Counting stick -- choral counting in 2s from 0 to 100, then backwards. Repeat for 5s. Emphasise the rhythm and the patterns in the ones digit: 2s give 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8... 5s give 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5... Shade multiples on a projected hundred square. **Patterns lens:** "What do you notice about where the coloured squares are? Can you predict which squares will be coloured next?"

**Practice (15 min):** Children shade their own hundred squares -- one for 2s, one for 5s. Describe the visual pattern in their books. Early finishers: can you count in 2s starting from a non-zero multiple (e.g. 14, 16, 18...)?

**Plenary (5 min):** "If I count in 5s, will I land on 73? How do you know?" (No -- 73 does not end in 0 or 5.)

**Key vocabulary:** count in twos, count in fives, multiple, step, sequence, pattern
**Differentiation:**
- Below: counting in 2s to 20 with Numicon tiles as support; start 5s at just 0-50
- Above: count in 2s and 5s from non-zero starting points; count backwards

---

### Lesson 2 (Tuesday): Counting in 3s -- new learning
**Concept:** MA-Y2-C001 | **Type:** New content

**Starter (5 min):** Rapid-fire counting in 2s and 5s from yesterday -- fingers up if you can hear the pattern.

**Main teaching (15 min):** "Today we learn a new counting pattern -- 3s. This is harder because the pattern in the ones digit is less obvious." Make groups of 3 cubes on the carpet. Count the total as each group is added: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21... Use the hundred square with every third square shaded. **Patterns lens:** "Look at the shaded squares. Is this pattern as neat as the 2s or 5s? Why not?"

Address the decade-boundary error explicitly: after 18, the next is 21, NOT 20 or 19. (From C001 common misconceptions.) Choral counting in 3s to 30 and back. The backward direction is significantly harder -- practise separately.

**Practice (15 min):** Paired counting with cubes: one child adds a group of 3, the other says the running total. Record the sequence in books. Shade every third number on the hundred square.

**Plenary (5 min):** "What comes after 27 when counting in 3s? Talk to your partner." (30.) "And after 18?" (21 -- the tricky one.)

**Key vocabulary:** count in threes, multiple, step, sequence, decade boundary
**Differentiation:**
- Below: counting in 3s to 15 only with physical cubes; use a number track not a hundred square
- Above: can you count in 3s from a number that is not a multiple of 3? What happens? (E.g. starting at 1: 1, 4, 7, 10...)

---

### Lesson 3 (Wednesday): Odd and even numbers
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C011 | **Type:** New content

**Starter (5 min):** Count in 2s from 0 to 30. "These numbers have a special name -- they are EVEN numbers."

**Main teaching (15 min):** Concrete first (following CV001 CPA stage: concrete -> pictorial -> abstract). Give every child a handful of cubes. "Can you share them equally into two groups? If yes, the number is even. If one is left over, the number is odd." Repeat 5 times with different quantities. **Patterns lens:** "What pattern do you notice about the even numbers? What do they all end in?"

Establish the digit rule through pattern observation after multiple examples: even numbers end in 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8. Odd numbers end in 1, 3, 5, 7 or 9. Test with larger numbers: Is 76 even or odd? Is 83? (From C011 teaching guidance -- ensure children can apply the rule beyond memorised lists.)

**Practice (15 min):** Sort numbers 1-30 into odd and even on a sorting diagram. Then apply to two-digit numbers: sort 34, 57, 62, 88, 41, 75, 90, 23. Hundred square: colour even numbers blue, odd numbers red.

**Plenary (5 min):** "Is 0 even or odd? Can you share 0 objects equally into 2 groups?" (Yes -- 0 in each group. 0 is even.) Address this misconception from C011 directly.

**Key vocabulary:** even, odd, multiple of two, share equally, pairs, digit rule
**Differentiation:**
- Below: work with numbers to 20 only; keep cubes available for every number
- Above: investigate -- is the sum of two even numbers always even? Always odd? Sometimes?

---

### Lesson 4 (Thursday): Odd and even patterns -- deeper investigation
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C011, MA-Y2-C021 (first touch) | **Type:** Investigation

**Starter (5 min):** Quick-fire odd or even? Flash two-digit numbers. Children show thumbs up (even) or thumbs down (odd).

**Main teaching (10 min):** "What happens when you add two even numbers? Two odd numbers? An odd and an even?" Children investigate with cubes in pairs. **Patterns lens at full stretch:** "Can you find a PATTERN? Can you make a RULE? Does your rule ALWAYS work?"

This is the first touch of MA-Y2-C021 (patterns and sequences) -- children are looking for a rule in a mathematical pattern. The cross-domain CO_TEACHES link between C011 and C008 (times tables) will be picked up in Spring term.

**Practice (20 min):** Children record findings in a table:

| + | Even | Odd |
|---|------|-----|
| Even | ? | ? |
| Odd | ? | ? |

Test at least 3 examples per cell. Write the rule in words. Extension: does the same rule work for subtraction?

**Plenary (10 min):** Share findings. "Even + even = even. Odd + odd = even. Even + odd = odd." Ask: "Why does odd + odd = even?" Use cubes to show: each odd number has one left over; two leftovers make a pair, so the total is even. This is genuine mathematical reasoning (MR-KS1-002).

**Key vocabulary:** even, odd, pattern, rule, predict, always, sometimes, never, prove

---

### Lesson 5 (Friday): Consolidation and counting assessment
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C001, MA-Y2-C011 | **Type:** Practice + formative assessment

**Starter (5 min):** Count in 2s, 3s and 5s -- teacher points to the counting stick, children respond. Mix the step size to keep them alert.

**Main teaching (10 min):** Revisit the hardest content from the week: counting in 3s backwards (C001 misconception: this is substantially harder than forwards) and applying odd/even to larger numbers. Quick teaching input on backward counting in 3s from 30: 30, 27, 24, 21, 18, 15, 12, 9, 6, 3, 0.

**Practice (10 min):** Short written assessment -- 15 questions, 10 minutes:
- Count in 2s: write the next 3 numbers after 14 (Q1-3)
- Count in 3s: write the next 3 numbers after 18 (Q4-6) -- tests the decade-boundary error
- Count in 5s: write the next 3 numbers after 45 (Q7-9)
- Odd or even? Six numbers to classify (Q10-15), including 0 and numbers > 50

**Plenary (15 min):** Self-mark and discuss. Identify children who need Week 2 intervention on counting in 3s specifically.

**Key vocabulary:** (consolidation -- no new vocabulary)
**Assessment note:** Results from this inform whether any child needs to stay on CL001 content during Week 2 rather than moving to CL002.

---

## Week 2: Place Value (D001-CL002) + Transition to Addition

**Cluster:** MA-Y2-D001-CL002 -- Understand place value in two-digit numbers
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C002 (Place value of tens and ones), MA-Y2-C003 (Comparing and ordering with < > =)
**Content Vehicle:** MA-Y2-CV001 (Place Value with Dienes Blocks)
**Thinking Lens:** Patterns (primary), Scale/Proportion/Quantity (secondary)
**Key question from CV001:** "Can pupils partition any 2-digit number into tens and ones using Dienes and without?"

### Lesson 6 (Monday): Place value -- tens and ones with Dienes
**Concept:** MA-Y2-C002 | **Type:** New content | **CPA stage:** CONCRETE

**Starter (5 min):** Spaced retrieval from Week 1: "Count in 3s from 0 to 21. Is 24 even or odd?"

**Main teaching (20 min):** This is the foundational lesson. Every child needs physical Dienes blocks (ten-sticks and unit cubes) -- CV001 specifies these as the primary concrete resource. Build numbers: "Show me 34 using your Dienes." Establish language: 34 has 3 tens and 4 ones. **The 3 represents 30, not 3.** (CV001 common error #1: "Thinking the digits represent their face value.")

Use place value mats (T | O columns) from CV001's representation list. Progress to numeral card overlays: 30 over 4 to make 34, physically showing that 34 = 30 + 4.

**Introduce flexible partitioning** (from C002 teaching guidance -- this is critical for subtraction later): 34 = 30 + 4, but also 34 = 20 + 14. Use exchange with Dienes: swap one ten-stick for 10 unit cubes.

**Scale/Proportion/Quantity lens:** "How many times bigger is a ten-stick than a unit cube? What does that tell us about how our number system works?"

**Practice (15 min):** Build and partition at least 8 different two-digit numbers using Dienes. Record partitions in books: 47 = 40 + 7, 47 = 30 + 17. CV001 success criterion 1: "Partition 2-digit numbers into tens and ones."

**Plenary (5 min):** "In the number 63, what does the 6 represent?" (60, not 6.) "How do you know?" (Because it is in the tens column -- 6 ten-sticks.)

**Key vocabulary:** tens, ones, digit, value, place value, partition, exchange, two-digit number
**Differentiation:**
- Below: work with numbers to 50; keep Dienes available throughout; partition in standard form only (no flexible partitioning yet)
- Above: flexible partitioning in 3 different ways (e.g. 47 = 40+7, 30+17, 20+27)

---

### Lesson 7 (Tuesday): Place value -- representing and reading numbers to 100
**Concept:** MA-Y2-C002 | **Type:** Practice | **CPA stage:** CONCRETE to PICTORIAL

**Starter (5 min):** Spaced retrieval: "Is 37 even or odd? How do you know?"

**Main teaching (15 min):** Transition from concrete to pictorial (CV001 CPA progression). Represent the same number in three ways: Dienes blocks, place value chart drawn on whiteboards, and numeral. Practise reading and writing numbers to 100 in numerals and words. Use the number line 0-100 as a key representation: locate numbers, first with tens marked, then estimating intermediate positions.

Address zero as a place holder (C002 teaching guidance): 30 has 3 tens and 0 ones. "The zero is important -- it holds the ones place. Without it, 30 would just be 3." (CV001 common error #3: writing numbers in reverse order, e.g. writing 41 for fourteen.)

**Practice (20 min):** Carousel:
1. Dienes station: build number, draw it, write it
2. Number line station: place numbers on the line, estimate positions
3. Written station: write numbers in words to 100

**Plenary (5 min):** "What is the same and what is different about 30 and 13?" (Both have 3 and 0/1 as digits, but 30 = 3 tens, 13 = 1 ten and 3 ones.)

**Key vocabulary:** tens, ones, place value, numeral, number line, estimate, represent, zero, place holder

---

### Lesson 8 (Wednesday): Comparing numbers to 100 with < > = symbols
**Concept:** MA-Y2-C003 | **Type:** New content | **CPA stage:** CONCRETE to ABSTRACT

**Starter (5 min):** Spaced retrieval: "Partition 56 in two different ways."

**Main teaching (15 min):** Introduce < > = symbols. Begin concretely (CV001 CPA stage): two towers of cubes -- which has more? Introduce the symbol: "The open end always points to the bigger number." The hungry crocodile mnemonic is a useful memory aid (C003 teaching guidance).

**Critical method:** When comparing two-digit numbers, compare tens digits first; if tens are equal, compare ones. Use place value understanding to justify: 47 > 39 because 4 tens is more than 3 tens. Practise with cases where tens are equal (45 vs 48) and where children might be misled (19 vs 21 -- C003 misconception: some pupils compare only the first digit).

**Patterns lens:** "What pattern do you use to compare two-digit numbers? Does the tens digit ALWAYS matter more than the ones digit?"

**Practice (15 min):** Write < > or = between pairs of numbers. Include carefully designed pairs that target C003 misconceptions: 19 __ 21, 38 __ 42, 55 __ 55, 67 __ 76. CV001 success criterion 3: "Compare 2-digit numbers using < > = symbols correctly."

**Plenary (5 min):** "Tom says 19 > 21 because 9 is bigger than 1. What has Tom got wrong?" (He is comparing the ones digits when the tens digits are different. 21 has 2 tens, 19 has only 1 ten.)

**Key vocabulary:** greater than, less than, equal to, compare, symbol, <, >, =
**Differentiation:**
- Below: compare with Dienes blocks alongside -- physically see which has more tens
- Above: compare three-digit numbers (just for those ready); order sets of 5+ numbers

---

### Lesson 9 (Thursday): Ordering sets of numbers
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C003, MA-Y2-C002 | **Type:** Practice | **CPA stage:** PICTORIAL to ABSTRACT

**Starter (5 min):** Quick-fire < > = with projected number pairs.

**Main teaching (10 min):** Order sets of 4-5 numbers from smallest to largest and largest to smallest. Introduce "ascending" and "descending." Strategy: find the smallest first (compare tens), then find the next smallest, and so on. Insert a number into an ordered sequence: "Where does 56 go in this list: 43, 51, __, 62, 78?"

**Practice (20 min):** Order sets of numbers. Include challenging sets with same tens digit: 34, 38, 31, 37, 33. Then mixed: 67, 12, 89, 45, 23.

CV001 success criterion 4: "Order a set of numbers from smallest to largest with explanation."

**Plenary (10 min):** Mini assessment: order 5 numbers and write 3 comparison statements using < > =. Mark together. CV001 assessment question: "Can they order a set of 2-digit numbers and explain their reasoning?"

**Key vocabulary:** order, ascending, descending, smallest, largest, sequence

---

### Lesson 10 (Friday): Place value checkpoint and bridge to addition
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C002, MA-Y2-C003 | **Type:** Assessment + bridge

**Starter (5 min):** Spaced retrieval from Week 1: "Count backwards in 3s from 21."

**Assessment (15 min):** Written checkpoint -- 12 questions:
- Q1-3: Partition numbers into tens and ones
- Q4-5: Flexible partitioning (e.g. 43 = 30 + ?)
- Q6-7: Represent numbers on a number line
- Q8-10: Compare pairs using < > =
- Q11-12: Order sets of 4 numbers

This addresses all CV001 assessment criteria and success criteria for the domain.

**Bridge to addition (15 min):** "We now know that 37 = 30 + 7. What if I asked you to work out 37 + 20? You know that 37 is 3 tens and 7 ones. Adding 20 means adding 2 more tens. So 3 tens + 2 tens = 5 tens. 50 + 7 = 57." This explicitly uses the cross-domain CO_TEACHES link: C002 (place value) feeds into C005 (two-digit addition).

**Plenary (5 min):** "Why did we learn place value before addition?" (Because understanding tens and ones is how we add bigger numbers.)

**Key vocabulary:** (assessment and revision -- no new vocabulary)
**Assessment note:** Results determine groupings for Weeks 3-5. Children below 60% on partitioning need small-group intervention before two-digit calculation.

---

## Week 3: Number Facts and Beginning Two-Digit Calculation (D002-CL001)

**Cluster:** MA-Y2-D002-CL001 -- Recall and use addition and subtraction facts to 20 and 100 [KEYSTONE]
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C004 (Facts to 20, derived to 100), MA-Y2-C005 (Two-digit add/sub)
**Content Vehicle:** MA-Y2-CV002 (Addition and Subtraction with Number Lines)
**Thinking Lens:** Patterns (primary)
**Key question from CV002:** "Can pupils add and subtract 2-digit numbers using a number line, showing jumps?"

### Lesson 11 (Monday): Number bonds to 10 and 20 -- rapid recall
**Concept:** MA-Y2-C004 | **Type:** Consolidation/fluency | **CPA stage:** CONCRETE (ten frames)

**Starter (5 min):** Prerequisite check (MA-Y1-C008): flash number bond cards to 10. Any child not recalling instantly is flagged for intervention.

**Main teaching (15 min):** Rapid-fire oral practice of bonds to 20 using "ping-pong" format: I say 13, you say 7. Introduce new vocabulary: "sum" and "difference" (new in Y2). The teaching point is AUTOMATICITY -- children should not be counting on fingers for 8 + 6 by this point (C004 teaching guidance). For those who are, provide ten frames (concrete support).

Practise all three forms of each bond: 8 + 6 = 14, 14 - 6 = 8, 14 - 8 = 6 (preparing for inverse relationship, C007).

**Practice (15 min):** Speed drill: 20 bonds to 20 in 2 minutes. Self-correct. Then partner ping-pong practice. **CV002 success criterion 2:** "Recall addition and subtraction facts to 20 fluently."

**Plenary (5 min):** "If you know 6 + 4 = 10, how many other facts can you write using those three numbers?" (3 more: 4 + 6 = 10, 10 - 4 = 6, 10 - 6 = 4.)

**Key vocabulary:** number bond, recall, fluent, sum, difference, addition, subtraction, fact

---

### Lesson 12 (Tuesday): Derived facts to 100
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C004, MA-Y2-C002 (cross-domain link) | **Type:** New content | **CPA stage:** CONCRETE

**Starter (5 min):** 10 rapid bonds to 20.

**Main teaching (20 min):** This is where place value meets number facts -- the cross-domain CO_TEACHES link (C002 <-> C004, rationale: "3+7=10 leads to 30+70=100"). Show with Dienes (CV002 manipulative): three ten-sticks + seven ten-sticks = ten ten-sticks = 100. The structure is identical to 3 + 7 = 10; only the UNIT has changed.

**Patterns lens:** "What PATTERN can you see between 3 + 7 = 10 and 30 + 70 = 100? Can you PREDICT what happens with 300 + 700?"

Derive: 6 + 4 = 10, so 60 + 40 = 100. What must I add to 50 to make 100? To 80?

**Practice (10 min):** Written practice: complete the derived fact chains. 2 + 8 = 10, so 20 + 80 = __. 5 + 5 = 10, so __ + __ = 100.

**Plenary (5 min):** "If 30 + 70 = 100, what is 30 + 71?" (101 -- extend to near-facts.)

**Key vocabulary:** derive, related fact, tens, number bond, place value

---

### Lesson 13 (Wednesday): Adding a two-digit number and ones (without bridging)
**Concept:** MA-Y2-C005 | **Type:** New content | **CPA stage:** CONCRETE to PICTORIAL

**Starter (5 min):** Spaced retrieval: "What is 40 + 60? What is 70 + 30?"

**Main teaching (15 min):** Model with Dienes (CV002 manipulative): 34 + 5. The tens stay the same; we add the ones: 4 + 5 = 9, so 34 + 5 = 39. Show on a number line (CV002 representation): start at 34, count on 5, land on 39.

Transition to pictorial: draw the jump on a number line. Begin column recording alongside: write 34 + 5 in a place value grid (CV002 CPA: pictorial to abstract).

**Practice (15 min):** 10 additions of 2-digit + ones with no bridging: 45 + 3, 61 + 7, 28 + 1, etc. Use Dienes alongside for any child who needs concrete support.

**Plenary (5 min):** "When I add ones to a two-digit number and the ones total is less than 10, what stays the same?" (The tens digit.)

**Key vocabulary:** add, ones, tens, count on, number line, column

---

### Lesson 14 (Thursday): Adding a two-digit number and ones (with bridging)
**Concept:** MA-Y2-C005 | **Type:** New content | **CPA stage:** CONCRETE to PICTORIAL

**Starter (5 min):** Quick 5 additions without bridging from yesterday.

**Main teaching (20 min):** Now the harder case: 37 + 6. The ones add to more than 10, so we cross the ten boundary. Model with Dienes: 7 ones + 6 ones = 13 ones = 1 ten and 3 ones. EXCHANGE: replace 10 unit cubes with 1 ten-stick. 37 + 6 = 43.

**CV002 common error #2:** "Not bridging through 10 correctly (e.g. 27 + 5)." Address this directly: 27 + 5 is NOT 22 (subtracting instead of adding) or 32 (not exchanging). Walk through step by step.

Show on number line with two jumps: 37 -> 40 (jump of 3) -> 43 (jump of 3). This "bridge through the next ten" strategy is the key difficulty.

**Practice (15 min):** Mixed: 5 without bridging, 5 with bridging. Children must identify which ones need bridging before calculating.

**Plenary (5 min):** "How do you know if a ones addition will need bridging?" (When the two ones digits add up to more than 9/10.)

**Key vocabulary:** add, ones, bridge, exchange, carry, count on, number line

---

### Lesson 15 (Friday): Adding a two-digit number and tens; subtracting tens
**Concept:** MA-Y2-C005 | **Type:** New content | **CPA stage:** CONCRETE to PICTORIAL

**Starter (5 min):** Spaced retrieval from Week 1: "Is 46 odd or even? Count in 3s from 18 to 30."

**Main teaching (15 min):** Model with Dienes: 34 + 20. Add the tens; the ones stay the same. Show on number line: start at 34, make two jumps of 10, land on 54. This is conceptually simpler than Thursday (no bridging).

Also introduce subtracting tens: 54 - 20 = 34, 78 - 30 = 48. Connect to place value: adding 20 means adding 2 tens, which changes the tens digit but not the ones.

**Cause and Effect lens:** "What CAUSES the tens digit to change? What CAUSES the ones digit to stay the same?"

**Practice (15 min):** Mixed addition and subtraction of tens: 45 + 30, 67 - 20, 18 + 50, 82 - 40. Column recording throughout.

**Plenary (5 min):** "I calculated 45 + 30 = 48. What mistake have I made?" (I have added the ones instead of the tens. The answer should be 75.)

**Key vocabulary:** add, subtract, tens, place value, jump, number line, column

---

## Week 4: Two-Digit Calculation (D002-CL001 continued)

**Cluster:** MA-Y2-D002-CL001 (continued -- this is the keystone cluster)
**Concept:** MA-Y2-C005 (continued)
**Content Vehicle:** MA-Y2-CV002
**Thinking Lens:** Patterns

### Lesson 16 (Monday): Adding two two-digit numbers (without bridging)
**Concept:** MA-Y2-C005 | **Type:** New content | **CPA stage:** CONCRETE to PICTORIAL

**Starter (5 min):** 5 mixed additions from last week (2-digit + ones, 2-digit + tens).

**Main teaching (15 min):** The most challenging addition type. Model 43 + 25 with Dienes: combine tens (4 + 2 = 6 tens), combine ones (3 + 5 = 8), total = 68. Partitioning strategy: 43 + 25 = (40 + 20) + (3 + 5) = 60 + 8 = 68.

Show on number line: start at 43, jump 20 (to 63), jump 5 (to 68). Column recording is essential -- it mirrors the Dienes work. CV002 CPA progression: "concrete (counting objects) -> pictorial (number line jumps) -> abstract (column method introduction)."

**Practice (20 min):** 8 additions of TU + TU without bridging, using number lines AND column recording side by side.

**Plenary (5 min):** "What is the same about adding TU + O, TU + T, and TU + TU?" (We always add ones with ones and tens with tens -- this is place value.)

**Key vocabulary:** add, partition, two-digit, tens, ones, column, total, sum

---

### Lesson 17 (Tuesday): Adding two two-digit numbers (with bridging)
**Concept:** MA-Y2-C005 | **Type:** New content | **CPA stage:** CONCRETE to PICTORIAL

**Starter (5 min):** 3 additions TU + TU without bridging.

**Main teaching (20 min):** 37 + 26. Ones: 7 + 6 = 13 = 1 ten and 3 ones. Tens: 3 + 2 + 1 (exchanged) = 6 tens. Total = 63. Model with Dienes: physically exchange 10 ones for 1 ten-stick.

Column recording: write 37 + 26 in columns. Emphasise: line up the tens and ones carefully. The "carry" goes above the tens column.

**Patterns lens:** "What pattern do you notice about WHEN we need to exchange?" (When the ones add up to 10 or more.)

**Practice (15 min):** 8 additions with bridging: 28 + 14, 37 + 45, 56 + 27, 19 + 33, etc.

**Plenary (5 min):** "I calculated 28 + 35 = 53. Am I right?" (28 + 35: 8 + 5 = 13, carry 1. 2 + 3 + 1 = 6 tens. 63, not 53. I forgot to carry.)

**Key vocabulary:** add, exchange, carry, bridge, column, tens, ones

---

### Lesson 18 (Wednesday): Subtracting two-digit numbers (without and with exchange)
**Concept:** MA-Y2-C005 | **Type:** New content | **CPA stage:** CONCRETE to PICTORIAL

**Starter (5 min):** Rapid bonds to 20 (spaced retrieval for C004).

**Main teaching (20 min):** Subtraction is harder. Model 48 - 23 with Dienes: remove 2 tens and 3 ones. Straightforward.

Now model 42 - 17: we need to remove 7 ones but only have 2. EXCHANGE one ten for 10 ones: 42 becomes 30 + 12. Now remove 7 ones (12 - 7 = 5) and 1 ten (3 - 1 = 2). Answer: 25. **This exchange links directly to the flexible partitioning taught in Lesson 6** (42 = 30 + 12).

**CV002 common error #3:** "Subtracting the smaller digit from the larger regardless of position." Address explicitly: children who subtract 2 - 7 and write 5, giving 35 instead of 25. Show with Dienes why this is wrong.

**Practice (10 min):** 4 subtractions without exchange, 4 with exchange. Use Dienes throughout.

**Plenary (5 min):** "Tom wrote 43 - 18 = 35. He subtracted 3 from 8 to get 5. Why is this wrong?" (You cannot subtract 8 from 3 that way -- you need to exchange a ten.)

**Key vocabulary:** subtract, difference, exchange, partition, count back, column

### Lesson 19 (Thursday): Adding three one-digit numbers
**Concept:** MA-Y2-C005 | **Type:** New content

**Starter (5 min):** 5 mixed additions and subtractions from this week.

**Main teaching (15 min):** A distinct skill. Model: 4 + 7 + 6. Strategy: look for a pair that makes 10 first. 4 + 6 = 10, so 4 + 7 + 6 = 10 + 7 = 17. This requires scanning all three numbers before calculating.

**Patterns lens:** "Can you spot the PATTERN of which pairs make 10? How does knowing your number bonds help?"

Practise: 8 + 3 + 2 (8+2=10), 5 + 9 + 5 (5+5=10), 7 + 4 + 3 (7+3=10). Note: this strategy relies on commutativity (C006), which we will formalise next week.

**Practice (15 min):** 10 three-number additions. Children ring the pair they add first and explain their strategy.

**Plenary (5 min):** "What if no pair makes 10? For 3 + 8 + 6, what is the easiest pair?" (8 + 6 = 14, or 3 + 6 = 9 then + 8 -- either is fine. The point is to look before you leap.)

**Key vocabulary:** add, total, sum, number bond, strategy, look for ten, three numbers

### Lesson 20 (Friday): Mixed calculation practice and checkpoint
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C004, MA-Y2-C005 | **Type:** Practice + assessment

**Starter (5 min):** Spaced retrieval from Weeks 1-2: "Partition 72 in two different ways. Is 72 > 68?"

**Practice carousel (20 min):**
1. Dienes station: build and solve TU + TU and TU - TU
2. Number line station: additions and subtractions with jumps drawn
3. Column recording station: formal written layout
4. Word problems: "I have 45p. I spend 28p. How much do I have left?"

CV002 assessment: "Can pupils add and subtract 2-digit numbers using a number line, showing jumps?"

**Mini checkpoint (15 min):** 12 questions:
- Q1-3: Bonds to 20 (rapid recall)
- Q4-5: Derived facts to 100
- Q6-7: TU + O (one with bridging)
- Q8: TU + T
- Q9-10: TU + TU (one with bridging)
- Q11: TU - TU with exchange
- Q12: Three one-digit numbers

Results inform groupings for Week 5.

## Week 5: Properties of Addition and Subtraction (D002-CL002)

**Cluster:** MA-Y2-D002-CL002 -- Understand properties and relationships of addition and subtraction
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C006 (Commutativity/associativity), MA-Y2-C007 (Inverse relationship)
**Content Vehicle:** MA-Y2-CV002 (covers C006 and C007)
**Thinking Lens:** Patterns (primary), Cause and Effect (secondary)

### Lesson 21 (Monday): Commutativity of addition
**Concept:** MA-Y2-C006 | **Type:** New content

**Starter (5 min):** Rapid bonds to 20.

**Main teaching (15 min):** "Does 5 + 3 give the same answer as 3 + 5?" Investigate with cubes: make a tower of 5 red and 3 blue. Turn it upside down -- now 3 blue and 5 red. Same total. Try with two-digit numbers: 24 + 13 and 13 + 24.

"This is called COMMUTATIVE -- it means the order does not matter for addition."

Now test subtraction: is 8 - 3 the same as 3 - 8? Number line: start at 8, count back 3, land on 5. Start at 3, try to count back 8 -- you go below zero. Subtraction is NOT commutative.

**CV002 success criterion 3:** "Explain that addition can be done in any order but subtraction cannot."

**Cause and Effect lens:** "What CAUSES addition to work both ways around? What CAUSES subtraction not to?"

**Practice (15 min):** Check calculations by reordering: calculate 45 + 23, then check with 23 + 45.

**Plenary (5 min):** "I say 15 - 8 = 8 - 15. Am I right? Convince me." (No -- subtraction is not commutative.)

**Key vocabulary:** commutative, order, rearrange, same total, check

---

### Lesson 22 (Tuesday): Commutativity applied -- efficient strategies
**Concept:** MA-Y2-C006 | **Type:** Practice

**Starter (5 min):** Spaced retrieval: "37 + 26 = ?"

**Main teaching (10 min):** Use commutativity strategically. For 3 + 47, do not count on 47 from 3 -- rearrange to 47 + 3. For 5 + 2 + 1, the curriculum says check by reordering: 5 + 2 + 1 = 1 + 5 + 2 = 1 + 2 + 5. This establishes associativity too -- grouping does not matter.

**Practice (20 min):** Rewrite calculations in the most efficient order. Verify that reordering gives the same answer. Identify when commutativity is useful (small number + large number) and when it does not matter.

**Plenary (10 min):** Link forward: "When we learn multiplication, do you think that will be commutative too?" (Cross-domain CO_TEACHES link: C006 <-> C010, rationale: "Teach as deliberate pair.")

**Key vocabulary:** commutative, associative, rearrange, efficient, strategy

---

### Lesson 23 (Wednesday): Inverse relationship -- fact families with bar models
**Concept:** MA-Y2-C007 | **Type:** New content

**Starter (5 min):** "If 8 + 5 = 13, what is 13 - 5?" (Testing inverse understanding informally.)

**Main teaching (20 min):** Addition and subtraction undo each other. Start with the bar model (part-whole model) -- CV002 representation. The whole is 12, the parts are 5 and 7. From this one model, write four facts: 5 + 7 = 12, 7 + 5 = 12, 12 - 7 = 5, 12 - 5 = 7. This is a "fact family."

**Patterns lens:** "What PATTERN do you see in the fact family? How are all four facts connected?"

Practise generating fact families from given numbers. Then apply to checking: if 36 + 27 = 63, what is 63 - 27? Children should answer immediately without recalculating.

**CV002 success criterion 4:** "Use the inverse operation to check answers."

**Practice (10 min):** Write complete fact families for 5 sets of three numbers. Use bar model diagrams for each.

**Plenary (5 min):** "I calculated 45 - 18 = 23. Check using the inverse." (23 + 18 = 41, not 45. So the answer is wrong. Correct answer: 45 - 18 = 27. Check: 27 + 18 = 45.)

**Key vocabulary:** inverse, opposite, undo, fact family, part, whole, bar model, check

---

### Lesson 24 (Thursday): Inverse relationship -- missing number problems
**Concept:** MA-Y2-C007, MA-Y2-C006 | **Type:** Practice

**Starter (5 min):** Write the fact family for 8, 6, 14.

**Main teaching (15 min):** Missing number problems require using the inverse. If ? + 9 = 16, then ? = 16 - 9 = 7. If ? - 5 = 13, then ? = 13 + 5 = 18. The position of the unknown changes the strategy.

Use bar models to make structure visible: which PART is missing? If the whole is missing, add the parts. If a part is missing, subtract from the whole.

C007 misconception: "Missing number problems where the unknown is at the start are consistently hardest." Give extra practice: ? - 5 = 13, ? + 7 = 24, ? - 12 = 30.

**Practice (15 min):** 12 missing number problems, all three positions: a + b = ?, a + ? = c, ? + b = c, and subtraction equivalents.

**Plenary (5 min):** "? - 15 = 28. Show me how you use the inverse to find the answer." (28 + 15 = 43.)

**Key vocabulary:** missing number, inverse, unknown, bar model, fact family

---

### Lesson 25 (Friday): Properties consolidation and mid-half-term check
**Concepts:** MA-Y2-C006, MA-Y2-C007 | **Type:** Consolidation + assessment

**Starter (5 min):** Spaced retrieval from Weeks 1-3: "Count in 3s from 12 to 30. Partition 85 in two ways. What is 60 + 40?"

**Practice (20 min):** Mixed problems requiring commutativity, inverse, and calculation:
- "Calculate 67 + 24, then check using commutativity."
- "Calculate 52 - 35, then check using the inverse."
- "Find the missing number: ? + 38 = 71."
- "Write the fact family for 46 + 29 = 75."

**Assessment (15 min):** CV002 full assessment check:
- Recall facts to 20 fluently? (timed: 20 in 2 minutes)
- Add and subtract TU + TU with number line? (3 questions)
- Explain commutativity? ("Is 24 + 35 the same as 35 + 24? Is 35 - 24 the same as 24 - 35?")
- Use inverse to check? (1 question)

This completes CV002 success criteria coverage.

## Week 6: Patterns, Consolidation and End-of-Half-Term Assessment

**Cluster:** MA-Y2-D001-CL003 (Patterns and sequences) + cross-domain consolidation
**Concept:** MA-Y2-C021 (Patterns and sequences)
**Thinking Lens:** Patterns (primary), Evidence and Argument (secondary)

### Lesson 26 (Monday): Patterns and sequences with mathematical objects
**Concept:** MA-Y2-C021 | **Type:** New content

**Starter (5 min):** Spaced retrieval: "? - 17 = 25. Use the inverse."

**Main teaching (15 min):** Patterns work connects to everything we have done this half-term. Begin with shape patterns: triangle, circle, triangle, circle -- what comes next? Progress to more complex repeating patterns: ABB (red, blue, blue, red, blue, blue), ABBC. Patterns that change in multiple attributes (shape AND colour AND size).

**Patterns lens at its fullest:** "What is the RULE? Can you PREDICT what comes next? Can you DESCRIBE the pattern so someone else could continue it without seeing it?"

Connect to number sequences: counting in 2s, 3s, 5s are sequences with a rule. The 2x table is a sequence: 2, 4, 6, 8... with the rule "add 2 each time."

**Practice (15 min):** Continue 6 different patterns (3 shape, 3 number). Create own pattern for a partner to continue.

C021 misconception: "Pupils often copy rather than identifying the rule -- they cannot continue a pattern shown from the middle."

**Plenary (5 min):** Show a pattern from the middle and ask: "What is the rule? What came before?"

**Key vocabulary:** pattern, sequence, repeat, rule, next, continue, predict, term

---

### Lesson 27 (Tuesday): Number patterns and early algebraic thinking
**Concept:** MA-Y2-C021 | **Type:** Practice

**Starter (5 min):** Continue the pattern: 5, 10, 15, __, __, __. What is the rule?

**Main teaching (10 min):** Growing patterns -- sequences where the amount CHANGES. 1, 3, 5, 7, 9... (add 2 each time, starting from 1 -- odd numbers!). Make with cubes: 1, then 3, then 5... draw each arrangement. Growing patterns are harder than repeating patterns (C021 teaching guidance).

**Evidence and Argument lens:** "How many examples do you need before you are SURE of the rule? Is 3 examples enough? 5?"

**Practice (20 min):**
- Identify rules for 6 sequences
- Generate 3 sequences from given rules ("Start at 4, add 3 each time")
- Investigation: "My sequence goes 2, 5, 8, 11... Will the number 20 appear in my sequence?"

**Plenary (10 min):** "Will 20 appear? How can you PROVE it?" (No -- the sequence goes ...17, 20, 23... Wait, it DOES land on 20! Check: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20. Yes.) Reasoning practice.

**Key vocabulary:** pattern, sequence, rule, growing, predict, term, prove

### Lesson 28 (Wednesday): Cross-domain problem solving
**Concepts:** All covered concepts | **Type:** Application

**Starter (5 min):** Mixed spaced retrieval: one from each week.

**Main teaching (5 min):** "Today we use everything we have learned this half-term together."

**Practice (30 min):** Problem-solving carousel -- 5 stations, 6 minutes each:
1. **Place value + addition:** "I think of a number. I add 25 and get 61. What was my number?" (Inverse: 61 - 25 = 36.)
2. **Odd/even + patterns:** "I start at 3 and count in 2s. Are all my numbers odd or even? Why?"
3. **Calculation + money context:** "A book costs 47p. I pay with a 50p coin. What change do I get?"
4. **Comparison + ordering:** "Put these results in order: Team A scored 34, Team B scored 43, Team C scored 38."
5. **Missing numbers + bar models:** "? + 28 = 65. Draw a bar model and solve."

**Plenary (5 min):** "Which station was hardest? Why?"

---

### Lesson 29 (Thursday): Revision and preparation
**Concepts:** All | **Type:** Revision

**Starter (5 min):** Quick-fire questions: one from every concept.

**Main teaching (10 min):** Address the most common errors from the Week 5 assessment. Typically: bridging errors in addition, exchange errors in subtraction, missing number problems with the unknown at the start.

**Practice (20 min):** Children work on personalised revision based on their checkpoint results:
- Group A (below expected): number bonds to 20 fluency + TU + O with bridging
- Group B (at expected): TU + TU with bridging + subtraction with exchange
- Group C (above expected): multi-step problems + generating own fact families for large numbers

**Plenary (5 min):** "What are you most confident about? What will you check carefully tomorrow?"

- Q24: Check using inverse
- Q25: Pattern -- continue a sequence and state the rule
