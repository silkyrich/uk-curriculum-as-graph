## Lesson 1 -- Monday: Light Sources and Vision

### What happened

The dark den experience was excellent. Every child was completely engaged. Two pupils (Alfie, Mei) claimed they could "kind of see" in the dark after waiting -- exactly the misconception documented in C022: "We can see in complete darkness if we wait long enough for our eyes to adjust." I asked them to close their eyes and keep them closed for 30 seconds, then open them inside the den. They conceded they still could not see the objects. I made the teaching point explicitly: "In COMPLETE darkness -- not a single photon of light -- we cannot see. At all. Ever. If you can see something, some light is getting in."

The luminous/non-luminous sorting activity worked well with the Drag to Categorise format (Y5 primary interaction type). Most pupils sorted correctly. Six pupils put the Moon in the luminous category -- again, exactly the misconception the graph flags for C022. I did not correct immediately. Instead I asked the Cause and Effect lens question: "What CAUSES us to see the Moon?" Two pupils worked it out: "The Sun shines on it and the light bounces to us." Good -- the Thinking Lens question genuinely provoked the right reasoning path.

**Sun safety (O027):** I delivered this as a non-negotiable safety instruction. The graph flags it under teaching guidance for C022 and under CV007 safety notes ("Do not shine torches directly into eyes"). I extended this to: never look directly at the Sun, use eclipse viewers, UV-blocking sunglasses. This took less time than planned -- I used 5 minutes rather than 10.

### Thinking Lens reflection

The Cause and Effect key question -- "What caused this to happen, and how do we know?" -- worked powerfully as a lesson frame. Displaying it on the board all lesson gave pupils language to use. By the end of the lesson, three pupils spontaneously used "because" in their exit ticket answers: "The Moon is non-luminous BECAUSE it does not produce its own light." This is precisely the "if... then... because..." frame that the Thinking Lens AI instruction recommends. I had not explicitly taught the frame yet, but the question prompted it naturally.

### Equipment notes

**Dark den:** I used the stock cupboard with a blackout cloth over the door frame. This is not listed in CV007's equipment list. CV007 lists "torches, opaque objects, white screen/card, mirrors, ruler, metre stick" -- all focused on the shadow investigation. Lesson 1 needs different equipment: a darkened space, assorted objects for the dark den, picture cards for sorting. This is a gap in CV007 -- the vehicle covers the investigation but not the introductory lesson that precedes it.

**Torches:** CV007 lists torches. I used a class set of 15 LED torches (one per pair). These are adequate but not ideal -- they produce a broad beam rather than a focused point source, which makes ray diagrams harder to demonstrate. A torch with a narrow beam would be better for Lesson 3. CV007 should specify "focused/narrow-beam torches" rather than just "torches."

### Pupil responses

Exit ticket results: 27/30 correctly named two luminous and two non-luminous objects. 23/30 correctly explained why the Moon is non-luminous. The 7 who struggled tended to write descriptions rather than explanations: "The Moon is not luminous because it is in space" (incorrect reasoning) rather than "because it does not produce its own light, it reflects the Sun's light."

## Lesson 2 -- Tuesday: Shadow Investigation (CV007 Core Practical)

### What happened

This was the big CV007 practical lesson. The Content Vehicle gave me everything I needed for the investigation structure, and it worked.

**Variables (from CV007):**
- Independent: distance between light source and object -- pupils understood this immediately after our planning discussion.
- Dependent: size of shadow (cm height) -- this required clarification. Several pupils wanted to measure shadow WIDTH as well as height. I allowed it for extension pairs but kept the main recording on height.
- Controlled: same light source, same object, same screen distance, darkened room -- this is where the value of CV001's structured variable format became clear. Having the controlled variables listed meant I could ask "What do we need to keep the same?" and check their answers against the list. All groups identified at least 3 of the 4 controlled variables.

**CV007 success criterion 1 addressed:** "Identify the independent, dependent, and controlled variables" -- checked for this formally in the planning phase.

The "if... then... because..." prediction frame from the Thinking Lens worked beautifully. Most pupils wrote: "IF we move the object closer to the light, THEN the shadow will get bigger, BECAUSE more light is blocked." This is actually a correct prediction with partially correct reasoning -- the shadow gets bigger because diverging rays are intercepted over a wider area, not simply because "more light is blocked." I did not correct this yet because the ray diagram explanation comes in Lesson 3. The graph's prerequisite chain is right: C024 (Shadow Formation) before C067 (Light Travels in Straight Lines).

**Recording format (from CV007):** "results table -> line graph -> ray diagram showing light travel." We completed the results table and began the line graph. The line graph was the right choice -- distance is continuous, so it should be a line graph not a bar chart. Some pupils initially drew a bar chart (the default for Y5 after the friction investigation in previous years). I had to explicitly teach: "When the independent variable is measured in numbers (cm), we use a line graph. When it is categories (carpet, wood, tile), we use a bar chart." This is a valuable teaching point that CV007 implicitly requires but does not explicitly flag. The vehicle should note: "Line graph appropriate because independent variable (distance) is continuous."

### Equipment issues

**Darkened room:** CV007 lists "darkened room" as a controlled variable. My classroom has large windows and inadequate blinds. I could not achieve true darkness. Shadows were visible but faint, and ambient light made measurement imprecise. I moved the investigation to the stock cupboard corner area where I could create better darkness using blackout cloth. This limited me to running 4 pairs at a time while others worked on vocabulary and prediction tasks at their desks. This is a genuine practical constraint that CV007 does not address.

**Recommendation for CV007:** Add a note under equipment or safety: "A darkened room or area is essential for clear shadow formation. If the classroom cannot be fully darkened, use a blackout tent, large cardboard box with one end open, or a corridor area with controllable lighting. Ambient light significantly reduces measurement accuracy."

**White screen/card:** CV007 lists "white screen/card." I used A3 white card taped to a book stand. This worked well. Some pupils needed a second person to hold the card steady while they measured. Pairs worked better than individuals for this reason.

**Metre stick vs ruler:** CV007 lists both. The ruler was sufficient for measuring shadow height (shadows ranged from 5cm to 35cm in our setup). The metre stick was needed for measuring the distance between torch and object (setup was approximately 60cm). Both were necessary.

### Safety considerations

CV007 safety note: "Do not shine torches directly into eyes. Supervise mirror use."

This is minimal and I supplemented it in practice:
1. Torch rule: beams stay pointed at the screen or table surface. Never at faces. I enforced this three times during the lesson -- Y5 children are generally sensible but excitement during practicals leads to carelessness.
2. One pair accidentally knocked a torch off the table and it broke open, scattering batteries. No injury, but I now tape the battery compartments shut before distributing torches. CV007 should mention this under safety.
3. No mirrors were used in this lesson (mirrors are for Lesson 4). CV007's safety note about mirrors was not yet relevant.

**What CV007 safety notes should add:**
- "Tape torch battery compartments to prevent accidental opening."
- "A darkened environment increases trip hazards. Ensure clear floor space and stable equipment placement before turning off lights."
- "Pupils should not stand on chairs or tables to adjust torch height."

### Recording format effectiveness

The CV007 recording format "results table -> line graph -> ray diagram" was exactly right for this investigation. However, it is ambitious for a single lesson. We completed the results table and started the line graph. The ray diagram component belongs in Lesson 3 (explaining the results using the straight-line model). In practice, CV007's recording format spans Lessons 2-3, not a single lesson. This is fine for planning -- but an AI generating a single-lesson plan from CV007 would try to cram all three recording formats into one session, which is unrealistic.

### Pupil responses

All 15 pairs obtained results showing the correct pattern (shadow size increases as object-to-torch distance decreases). Three pairs had anomalous results at one distance due to torch position shifting mid-test. I used this as a teaching point: "This is why we do 3 trials and calculate the mean -- to smooth out errors."

## Lesson 3 -- Wednesday: Light Travels in Straight Lines (C067)

### What happened

The most important lesson of the week -- introducing the Y6 straight-line model (C067). This is the explanatory concept that underpins everything else in Light.

**Generation Effect (Y5 pedagogy technique):** I started by asking pupils to write down what they think happens to light between a torch and a wall. The graph's pedagogy profile says: "Before showing the worked example or revealing the formula: 'What do you remember about how [X] works?'" This worked. Most pupils wrote "light goes from the torch to the wall" or "light shines on the wall." Three pupils drew straight lines. Two drew wavy lines (confusing light with sound waves -- an interesting misconception not documented in the graph). Nobody drew light going from the eye to the wall, which I had expected to see based on C067's documented misconception about emission theory.

**Torch-and-cards demonstration:** This is described in C067 teaching guidance: "Shine a torch through a series of cards with holes -- the light only reaches the end if all holes are aligned." I used 4 pieces of A4 card with 1cm holes punched in the centre, held in line with Blu-Tack on metre sticks stood in modelling clay. When aligned: bright spot visible on the screen. When one card misaligned by 2cm: no light. The class gasped. This is an excellent demonstration -- the graph's teaching guidance describes it well.

**Issue:** The torch-and-cards demonstration requires specific equipment that is NOT listed in CV007. CV007's equipment is: "torches, opaque objects, white screen/card, mirrors, ruler, metre stick." The demonstration needs: multiple cards with pre-cut holes, supports for the cards (Blu-Tack, modelling clay, or card stands), and a narrow-beam torch. I had to improvise the supports. This is a significant omission -- the demonstration is the key teaching moment for C067, and CV007 should include the specific equipment for it.

**Laser pointer:** C067 teaching guidance mentions "Use laser pointers (teacher-operated, safely) in a dusty or misty room to show the straight beam." CV007 does not list a laser pointer. I used a green laser pointer (class 2, eye-safe at brief exposure) in a room with a small amount of chalk dust in the air. The visible beam was dramatic and highly effective. Safety: I held the pointer throughout, kept the beam at waist height, and pointed it away from pupils. No issues.

**Laser pointer safety should be in CV007:** Class 2 laser pointers are standard primary science equipment. CV007 should list them with the note: "Teacher-operated only. Class 2 (< 1mW) laser pointer. Keep beam below eye level. Do not allow pupils to handle. Point away from faces. Use in well-ventilated room with light dust or mist to make beam visible."

**Ray diagrams:** The teaching guidance for C067 says to "draw ray diagrams showing light blocked by the object, creating a shadow behind it." Pupils drew their first ray diagrams. Most understood the concept but struggled with the drawing convention: straight lines with arrows, originating from the source. Common errors: drawing rays that curved, drawing rays from the object instead of toward the object, drawing rays coming from the eye. I modelled three examples on the board before asking them to draw independently.

### Thinking Lens reflection

The Cause and Effect lens was powerful here. "What CAUSED the light to be blocked?" -- the misaligned card. "What does this tell us about HOW light travels?" -- it goes in straight lines and cannot bend around the card. Every pupil could answer these questions verbally. The lens gave them a reasoning scaffold for the explanation.

However, I noticed the Thinking Lens AI instruction says: "prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation." This is appropriate for fair test investigations but slightly off-target for the straight-line model lesson, which is more about building an explanatory model than testing causation. The lens question "What caused this to happen?" still works, but the deeper prompt about correlation vs. causation does not quite fit. The Thinking Lens rationale for CL002 reads: "Fair testing and investigations are designed to isolate variables and establish causal relationships" -- but CL002 is about explanation and modelling, not fair testing. The rationale text is identical across both Light clusters, which suggests it was assigned generically rather than tailored. I will flag this in my v5 findings.

### Misconception check

I explicitly tested C067's key misconception: "Does light travel FROM your eyes TO the object, or FROM the object TO your eyes?" I used the historical framing (Alhazen vs. the Greeks). 26/30 pupils answered correctly (from the object to the eye). The 4 who were unsure were not committed to the wrong answer -- they were uncertain, which is a good starting position for Lesson 4's "how we see" model.

## Lesson 4 -- Thursday: Reflection and How We See

### What happened

**Mirror investigation:** CV007 lists mirrors in the equipment. I used small flat mirrors (10cm x 10cm, plastic-backed for safety). The challenge to redirect a torch beam around an obstacle using mirrors was highly engaging. Pairs worked out that they needed to angle the mirror so the beam bounced toward the target. Three pairs managed to bounce the beam off two mirrors in sequence.

**Safety considerations for mirrors:** CV007 says "Supervise mirror use." In practice, the safety considerations are more specific:
1. Reflective beams: when pupils angle mirrors toward each other or the ceiling, reflected beams can hit faces and eyes. I established the rule: "Mirror beams stay below shoulder height."
2. Broken mirrors: I used plastic-backed mirrors to eliminate glass shard risk. Standard glass mirrors should not be used for Y5 practicals. CV007 should specify "plastic-backed or acrylic mirrors."
3. One pupil accidentally reflected sunlight from the window across the room and into another pupil's eyes. The pupil was fine (brief glare, no harm), but this reinforced the need for the below-shoulder-height rule. This is a foreseeable hazard that CV007 does not mention.

**The "how we see" model:** Drawing the full light path -- light source -> object -> reflected to eye -- was the culminating teaching point. I modelled three scenarios on the board:
1. Seeing a lamp (direct light to eye -- luminous object)
2. Seeing a book (light source -> reflects off book -> to eye)
3. Seeing a friend (light source -> reflects off friend -> to eye)

Thinking Lens: "What CAUSES us to see a book on the desk?" Pupils traced the light path. 24/30 drew correct ray diagrams independently. The 6 who struggled mostly forgot the reflection step -- they drew light going directly from the source to the eye, skipping the object. This is not a documented misconception in the graph; it is a procedural error in ray diagram drawing. The graph's misconception data covers conceptual errors (emission theory, only mirrors reflect) but not diagrammatic errors. This is a reasonable gap -- diagrammatic conventions are hard to encode in a knowledge graph.

**Cross-domain link:** The graph identifies a CO_TEACHES link between SC-KS2-C067 and MA-Y5-C015 (Reflections and translations in all four quadrants). I mentioned angles briefly: "The angle the light hits the mirror equals the angle it bounces off." Four extension pupils measured this with protractors and found approximate equality (within a few degrees). This is a genuine and useful cross-domain connection. The graph's rationale -- "Light investigation (angles of incidence/reflection) requires understanding of angles from Maths" -- is accurate.

### CV007 success criteria check

CV007 success criterion 4: "Draw a ray diagram showing how we see objects (light source -> object -> eye)."
Result: 24/30 achieved. 6 pupils need additional support before Friday's assessment.

### Recording format

CV007 specifies "ray diagram showing light travel" as the final recording format stage. This was appropriate. Pupils drew ray diagrams in their science books. The better diagrams included: arrows showing direction, labels for each component (source, object, eye), and the word "reflects" at the object surface.

---

## Lesson 5 -- Friday: Assessment

### What happened

The assessment was structured around CV007's four success criteria, with additional misconception-targeting questions drawn from the concept descriptions.

**Section A (Ray Diagrams):** This directly tested CV007 success criteria 1-4.
- Q1 (label a "how we see" diagram): 25/30 fully correct. 3 partially correct (forgot arrows). 2 incorrect (light from eye to object -- the emission theory misconception from C067 persisting in 2 pupils despite explicit teaching).
- Q2 (explain shadow shape using ray diagrams): 22/30 fully correct. 5 drew the shadow but did not use rays to explain. 3 did not attempt.
- Q3 (explain why shadow gets bigger when object moves closer): 19/30 fully correct. The weaker answers described the pattern ("the shadow gets bigger") without explaining the mechanism (diverging rays).

**Section B (True/False -- misconception targeting):** All 6 statements were derived from documented misconceptions in C022, C023, C024, C067.
- "We see because light travels from our eyes to objects" -- 28/30 correctly said FALSE. The 2 who said TRUE are the same 2 who drew incorrect ray diagrams in Section A. These pupils need targeted intervention.
- "Only shiny things like mirrors reflect light" -- 26/30 correctly said FALSE. 4 pupils wrote "TRUE" and then corrected themselves during peer discussion, suggesting the knowledge was there but not yet automatic.
- "The Moon is a light source" -- 29/30 correctly said FALSE. The dark den activity in Lesson 1 embedded this effectively.

**Section C (Cyclist explanation):** This application question required pupils to combine C023 (reflection) and C067 (straight lines) in a real-world context.
- 20/30 gave a full explanation: car headlights shine light -> light travels in straight lines to cyclist -> reflects off reflective jacket -> travels in straight lines back to driver's eyes.
- 7/30 gave partial explanations (missing one step, usually the return path to the driver's eye).
- 3/30 wrote "the jacket shines" without explaining the mechanism.

### Assessment verdict

**CV007 Success Criteria Achievement:**
| Criterion | Achieved | Partial | Not achieved |
|-----------|----------|---------|--------------|
| Explain that light travels in straight lines | 27 | 1 | 2 |
| Explain how shadows are formed by opaque objects blocking light | 25 | 3 | 2 |
| Predict and test how shadow size changes with distance | 22 | 5 | 3 |
| Draw a ray diagram showing how we see objects | 24 | 3 | 3 |

Overall: 20/30 pupils (67%) achieved all four criteria. 8 achieved three. 2 need significant support.

The misconception data in the graph was directly responsible for the quality of the True/False section. Every distractor came from a documented misconception. This is the graph's strongest feature for assessment generation.

### Thinking Lens -- end-of-week reflection

I asked: "What patterns did you notice across all our light investigations this week?" (Patterns lens, secondary for both clusters.)

Responses:
- "Light always goes in straight lines -- it never curves." (13 pupils)
- "The closer to the light, the bigger the shadow." (9 pupils)
- "Shiny things reflect more light than dull things." (5 pupils)
- "We always need light to see." (3 pupils)

The Patterns lens worked well as a consolidation tool. The Cause and Effect lens worked better as a real-time enquiry tool during lessons. Using both lenses across the week -- Cause and Effect during the investigation, Patterns for reflection -- was a natural pairing that the graph already encodes (both clusters have Cause and Effect primary, Patterns secondary).

## Week 1 Summary

### What CV007 gave me that I could not plan without

1. **Structured variables** (independent, dependent, controlled) -- this saved 10 minutes of planning time and ensured I did not miss a controlled variable. The explicit list also meant I could CHECK pupils' planning against a known-correct answer.
2. **Recording format** (results table -> line graph -> ray diagram) -- the three-stage progression was exactly right. An NQT could follow this without modification.
3. **Expected outcome** -- knowing what the result should be before the lesson starts is essential. I could monitor pairs during the practical and immediately intervene when results did not match expectation (usually a setup error, not a conceptual error).
4. **Success criteria** -- these gave me a ready-made assessment checklist. I used them verbatim on the Friday assessment.
5. **Definitions list** -- pre-agreed vocabulary meant my working wall matched the Content Vehicle, which will match any AI-generated content. Consistency.

### What CV007 did NOT give me that I needed

1. **Lesson-by-lesson equipment breakdown.** CV007 lists equipment for the investigation but not for the introductory/explanatory lessons. Lessons 1 and 3 needed additional equipment (dark den materials, cards with holes for the straight-line demo, laser pointer) that is not in the vehicle.
2. **Darkened room guidance.** Essential for the investigation and not addressed beyond "darkened room" as a controlled variable.
3. **Laser pointer.** Mentioned in C067 teaching guidance but not in CV007 equipment. This is the single most effective demonstration tool for the straight-line concept and should be listed with safety notes.
4. **Mirror safety specifics.** "Supervise mirror use" is insufficient. Need: plastic-backed mirrors, beam-below-shoulder-height rule, no reflecting sunlight from windows.
5. **Time allocation guidance.** The recording format "table -> line graph -> ray diagram" spans at least 2 lessons. CV007 presents it as one sequence without indicating this. An AI generating a single-lesson plan would overpack the lesson.

### What the Thinking Lenses gave me

1. **A consistent question frame** displayed all week that pupils internalised. By Friday, 13/30 spontaneously used "because" in their explanations. The Cause and Effect lens scaffolded explanation without me explicitly teaching "how to write an explanation."
2. **A second lens for consolidation.** Patterns as the secondary lens gave me a natural reflection question for the end of the week.
3. **Language for the AI.** If this class were using an AI tutor, the Thinking Lens AI instructions would generate questions in the same frame I used in class. That consistency between classroom and AI is valuable.

### What the Thinking Lenses did NOT give me

1. **The CL002 rationale is generic, not tailored.** The Cause and Effect rationale for both CL001 and CL002 reads: "Fair testing and investigations are designed to isolate variables and establish causal relationships." CL002 is about explanation and modelling (ray diagrams, the straight-line model), not fair testing. The rationale should differ.
2. **No lens for the "how we see" model specifically.** The "how we see" model (Lesson 4) is fundamentally a Structure and Function concept -- "how does the structure of the eye/light path enable us to see?" The Cause and Effect lens still worked, but Structure and Function might be more precise for that specific lesson.
