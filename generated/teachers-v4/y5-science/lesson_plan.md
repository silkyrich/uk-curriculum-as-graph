# Y5 Science Lesson Plan: Light and Forces (2-Week Unit)

**Teacher:** Mrs Priya Kapoor, Y5 Class Teacher and Science Coordinator
**Class:** Y5 (30 pupils) | **Duration:** 2 weeks, 5 lessons per week (1 hour each)
**Domains:** Light (SC-KS2-D005) and Forces & Magnets (SC-KS2-D006)
**Content Vehicles:** SC-KS2-CV007 (Light and Shadows), SC-KS2-CV001 (Friction Investigation)
**Thinking Lenses:** Cause and Effect (primary for Light and Magnets CL002), Patterns (primary for Forces CL001, secondary across all)

---

## Planning Rationale

This unit pairs Light (SC-KS2-D005) and Forces & Magnets (SC-KS2-D006) across two weeks. Light concepts span Y3 (C022, C023, C024) and Y6 (C067), so I am compressing Y3 retrieval into starters and focusing new learning time on the Y6 straight-line model. Forces & Magnets (D006) is entirely Y3 content -- for Y5 this is retrieval and consolidation before the Y5 Forces domain (D013: gravity, resistance forces, mechanisms) which they will meet next half-term.

The graph provides two Content Vehicles that structure the practical work:
- **SC-KS2-CV007** (Light and Shadows) -- a fair test investigation with explicit variables, equipment, and recording formats
- **SC-KS2-CV001** (Friction Investigation) -- a fair test investigation with structured variables and success criteria

Both clusters in Light use the **Cause and Effect** lens as their primary Thinking Lens. Forces CL001 uses the **Patterns** lens as primary. I will thread the lens key questions through each lesson to frame the enquiry.

### Prerequisites Checked (from graph)
- SC-KS1-C026 (Material Properties) feeds into both SC-KS2-C022 and SC-KS2-C027 -- pupils should know basic material properties (opaque/transparent, rough/smooth)
- SC-KS2-C022, C023, C024 are prerequisites for SC-KS2-C067 -- Y3 light concepts must be secure before the straight-line model
- SC-KS2-C025 is prerequisite for SC-KS2-C055 (Gravity, Y5) -- contact/non-contact framework must be established this unit

### Cross-Domain Links (from graph)
- SC-KS2-C067 (Light) links to MA-Y5-C015 (Reflections and translations) -- angles of reflection require maths geometry
- SC-KS2-C027 (Friction) links to MA-Y3-C015 (Formal columnar subtraction) -- measurement skills for force meters and distances

## WEEK 1: LIGHT (SC-KS2-D005)

### Content Vehicle: SC-KS2-CV007 -- Light and Shadows (investigation)
**Enquiry type:** fair_test
**Equipment needed (from CV007):** torches (class set of 15), opaque objects (set of assorted shapes), white screen/card (A3), mirrors (15 small flat mirrors), ruler, metre stick
**Additional equipment (teacher supplement):** cards with holes for straight-line demo, darkened room/blackout blinds, protractor (for extension), laser pointer (teacher only)

### Thinking Lens: Cause and Effect (primary for CL001 and CL002)
**Key question displayed all week:** "What caused this to happen, and how do we know?"
**AI instruction from graph:** Prompt pupils to distinguish correlation from causation, design tests that isolate variables, construct "if... then... because..." explanations, and identify multiple causes.

---

### Lesson 1 -- Light Sources and Vision (Retrieval + New Framing)
**Monday, Period 1**

**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C022 (Light and Vision) -- retrieval from Y3
**Cluster:** SC-KS2-D005-CL001 (Investigate light sources, vision, and the formation of shadows)
**Objectives:** SC-KS2-O025 (recognise that they need light to see), SC-KS2-O027 (sun safety)
**WS focus:** WS-KS2-002 (Making systematic observations) -- linked to C022 via disciplinary skills
**Thinking Lens:** Cause and Effect -- "What causes us to see things?"

**Lesson structure:**

1. **(5 min) Retrieval starter -- Thinking Lens hook.**
   Display the Cause and Effect key question: "What causes us to see things?"
   Pupils write their initial answer on whiteboards. Collect -- these will reveal the "light goes from eye to object" misconception (documented in C067 misconceptions). Do not correct yet.

2. **(10 min) Dark den experience.**
   Equipment: blacked-out area (cupboard with blackout cloth), selection of objects.
   Pupils enter in pairs and attempt to identify objects in complete darkness.
   Key teaching point (from C022 teaching guidance): "In complete darkness we cannot see at all -- dark is the absence of light, not a substance."
   Address misconception (from C022): "We can see in complete darkness if we wait long enough for our eyes to adjust" -- no, in truly complete darkness, we cannot see anything.

3. **(15 min) Classifying light sources.**
   Using CV007 definitions: light source, opaque, transparent, translucent.
   Interaction type: Drag to Categorise (primary for Y5).
   Sort objects/images into: luminous (produces own light: sun, torch, candle, TV screen) vs. non-luminous (reflects light: moon, table, book, mirror).
   Address misconception (from C022): "The Moon produces its own light" -- it reflects sunlight.
   Thinking Lens prompt: "What CAUSES us to see the Moon if it does not produce light?"

4. **(10 min) Sun safety (statutory objective O027).**
   Never look directly at the sun. UV-blocking sunglasses. Eclipse viewers.
   CV007 safety note: "Do not shine torches directly into eyes" -- establish this rule for the whole unit.

5. **(10 min) Vocabulary wall and prediction.**
   Set up Light vocabulary wall using CV007 key vocabulary: light source, opaque, transparent, translucent, shadow, reflection, ray, straight line.
   Return to opening question. Revisit whiteboards -- has anyone changed their mind? Preview: "This week we will find out exactly what causes us to see."

6. **(5 min) Exit ticket.**
   "Name two luminous and two non-luminous objects. Explain why the Moon is non-luminous."

**Equipment checklist:** Blackout cloth or dark den, assorted objects for dark den, picture cards for sorting, torches x15, vocabulary cards.

### Lesson 2 -- Shadow Formation Investigation (CV007 Core Practical)
**Tuesday, Period 1**

**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C024 (Shadow Formation) -- retrieval from Y3; fair test is the CV007 investigation
**Cluster:** SC-KS2-D005-CL001
**Objectives:** SC-KS2-O028 (shadows form when light blocked), SC-KS2-O029 (patterns in shadow size)
**WS focus:** WS-KS2-003 (Planning enquiries and controlling variables) -- linked to C067 via disciplinary skills
**Thinking Lens:** Cause and Effect -- "What causes the shadow to change size?"
**Enquiry type:** fair_test (from CV007)

**Lesson structure:**

1. **(5 min) Retrieval starter.**
   "What is a shadow?" Retrieve Y3 knowledge. Address misconception (from C024): shadows are NOT reflections -- they are areas where light has been blocked.
   Classify materials: opaque (blocks light, creates shadow), translucent (some light through, faint shadow), transparent (most light through, no shadow).

2. **(10 min) Investigation setup -- using CV007 structured variables.**
   Display the investigation question: "How does the distance between the light source and the object affect shadow size?"
   **Variables (from CV007):**
   - Independent: distance between light source and object
   - Dependent: size of shadow (cm height)
   - Controlled: same light source, same object, same screen distance, darkened room

   Thinking Lens prompt: "IF we move the object closer to the light, THEN what will happen to the shadow, BECAUSE...?"
   Pupils write predictions using the "if... then... because..." frame.

3. **(20 min) Practical investigation.**
   Equipment (from CV007): torches, opaque objects, white screen/card, ruler, metre stick.
   Pairs set up torch at one end, screen at other end (60cm apart). Place opaque object at 10cm, 20cm, 30cm, 40cm, 50cm from torch. Measure shadow height each time.
   **Recording format (from CV007):** Results table with columns: Distance from torch (cm) | Shadow height trial 1 (cm) | Shadow height trial 2 (cm) | Shadow height trial 3 (cm) | Mean (cm)
   Safety (from CV007): Do not shine torches directly into eyes. Supervise mirror use.

4. **(10 min) Recording and pattern identification.**
   **Recording format (from CV007):** table of results leading to line graph.
   Pupils begin plotting line graph (distance on x-axis, mean shadow height on y-axis).
   Thinking Lens -- Patterns (secondary): "What pattern can you see in your results? Does it always happen?"
   Expected outcome (from CV007): "Shadow size increases as the object moves closer to the light source."

5. **(5 min) Conclusion -- Cause and Effect frame.**
   "The shadow got bigger BECAUSE the object blocked MORE of the light WHEN it was closer to the source."
   Preview: "Tomorrow we will find out WHY this happens -- using a model about how light travels."

**Equipment checklist:** Torches x15, opaque objects (solid shapes) x15, white card screens x15, rulers x15, metre sticks x8, masking tape, graph paper.

### Lesson 3 -- Light Travels in Straight Lines (The Key Y6 Concept)
**Wednesday, Period 1**

**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C067 (Light Travels in Straight Lines) -- NEW Y6 content, the explanatory model
**Cluster:** SC-KS2-D005-CL002 (Explain how light travels in straight lines and is reflected from surfaces)
**Objectives:** SC-KS2-O079 (light appears to travel in straight lines)
**WS focus:** WS-KS2-003 (Planning enquiries and controlling variables) -- linked to C067
**Thinking Lens:** Cause and Effect -- "What causes light to reach us? What stops it?"

**Lesson structure:**

1. **(5 min) Retrieval starter -- Generation Effect (Y5 pedagogy technique).**
   "Before I show you, write down: what do you think happens to light between a torch and the wall?"
   Accept all answers. This generation attempt improves encoding of the correct model.

2. **(15 min) Teacher demonstration -- torch and cards.**
   Equipment: 4 pieces of card with identical small holes, torch, darkened room.
   Demonstration (from C067 teaching guidance): "Shine a torch through a series of cards with holes -- the light only reaches the end if all holes are aligned."
   Step 1: Align all 4 cards. Light passes through to the end. Step 2: Misalign one card. Light is blocked.
   Thinking Lens: "What CAUSED the light to be blocked? What does this tell us about HOW light travels?"
   Introduce the model: light travels in STRAIGHT LINES from its source. It cannot bend around obstacles.
   Use laser pointer (teacher-operated only -- CV007 safety: "Do not shine torches directly into eyes" extends to laser pointers) in a slightly dusty or misty room to make the straight beam visible.

3. **(15 min) Ray diagrams -- modelling tool.**
   Introduce the term "ray" -- a straight line with an arrow showing the direction light travels.
   Model how to draw ray diagrams:
   - Light source emitting rays outward
   - Rays hitting an opaque object -- blocked (shadow behind)
   - Rays passing around the object -- illuminate the screen
   Pupils draw ray diagrams to explain why the shadow has the same shape as the object (C067 teaching guidance).
   Thinking Lens: "What CAUSED the shadow to be the same shape? Draw the rays to prove it."

4. **(10 min) Applying the model to Lesson 2 results.**
   "Now explain WHY the shadow was bigger when the object was closer to the light."
   Draw diverging rays from a point source. When the object is closer, it intercepts a wider spread of rays.
   Pupils annotate their line graphs from Lesson 2 with this explanation.

5. **(5 min) Misconception check.**
   Address C067 misconception directly: "Does light travel FROM your eyes TO the object, or FROM the object TO your eyes?"
   Historical context: the Greeks believed light came from the eye (emission theory). Alhazen proved it comes to the eye.
   Assessment check (from CV007): "Can pupils explain how shadows are formed using the concept of light travelling in straight lines?"

**Equipment checklist:** Cards with holes x4, torch x1 (teacher), laser pointer x1 (teacher only), darkened room, whiteboard for ray diagram modelling.

### Lesson 4 -- Reflection and How We See (CV007 Continuation)
**Thursday, Period 1**

**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C023 (Reflection of Light), SC-KS2-C067 (Light Travels in Straight Lines)
**Cluster:** SC-KS2-D005-CL002
**Objectives:** SC-KS2-O026 (light reflected from surfaces), SC-KS2-O080, SC-KS2-O081 (how we see objects)
**WS focus:** WS-KS2-002 (Making systematic observations) -- linked to C022 via disciplinary skills
**Thinking Lens:** Cause and Effect -- "What causes us to see objects that do not produce their own light?"

**Lesson structure:**

1. **(5 min) Retrieval starter -- interleaved practice (Y5 pedagogy technique).**
   Mix questions from Lessons 1-3:
   - "Name the 3 types of material by transparency" (opaque, translucent, transparent -- C024)
   - "Draw a ray showing light travelling from a torch to a wall" (C067)
   - "Why is the Moon not a light source?" (C022)

2. **(15 min) Mirror investigation.**
   Equipment (from CV007): mirrors x15 (small flat mirrors), torches x15.
   Challenge 1: In a darkened room, use a mirror to redirect a torch beam around an obstacle.
   Challenge 2: Can you bounce the beam off TWO mirrors to reach a target?
   Key teaching point (from C023 teaching guidance): "Shiny, smooth surfaces (mirrors, foil, still water) reflect light well, while rough or dark surfaces reflect less light."
   Address misconception (from C023): "Only shiny objects like mirrors reflect light" -- ALL visible objects reflect some light. That is how we see them.
   CV007 safety: "Supervise mirror use." Ensure pupils do not reflect beams into eyes.

3. **(15 min) The complete "how we see" model.**
   Draw the full ray diagram model:
   Light source --> light travels in straight lines --> hits object --> reflects off object --> travels in straight lines --> enters our eye.
   Thinking Lens: "What CAUSES us to see a book on the desk? Trace the light."
   This addresses SC-KS2-O080 and O081 directly.
   CV007 success criterion: "Draw a ray diagram showing how we see objects (light source -> object -> eye)"
   Pupils draw their own "how we see" diagrams for 3 scenarios: seeing a lamp, seeing a book, seeing a friend's face.

4. **(10 min) Everyday applications.**
   Connect to real life (from C023 teaching guidance): bicycle reflectors, reflective clothing, cat's eyes on roads.
   Why do these work? They reflect car headlight beams back towards the driver's eyes.
   Cross-domain link (from graph): SC-KS2-C067 links to MA-Y5-C015 (Reflections and translations) -- angles. Y5 extension: the angle of reflection equals the angle at which light hits the mirror. Use protractors.

5. **(5 min) Exit ticket -- CV007 assessment check.**
   "Draw a ray diagram showing how you see your pencil case on the table. Label: light source, reflected ray, eye."
   Assessment (from CV007): "Can they draw a ray diagram showing how we see an object?"

**Equipment checklist:** Torches x15, flat mirrors x15 (small, no sharp edges), protractors x15 (extension), obstacles (books), darkened room.

   **Section C: Explanation (4 marks)**
   "A cyclist wears a reflective jacket at night. Explain, using the idea that light travels in straight lines, how a car driver is able to see the cyclist." [4 marks]
   -- Applies C023, C067, and CV007 success criterion 1.

3. **(10 min) Peer discussion and self-assessment.**
   Pairs compare answers. Discuss: where in the building would you find the biggest shadows? The smallest? Why?
   Thinking Lens -- Patterns: "What patterns did you notice across all our light investigations this week?"

4. **(5 min) Bridge to next week.**
   "Next week we investigate FORCES. Light travels in straight lines -- but what makes objects MOVE? What STOPS them?"
   Preview the Cause and Effect lens question for forces: "What caused this to happen, and how do we know?"

**CV007 Success Criteria Checklist (teacher tracking):**
- [ ] Explain that light travels in straight lines
- [ ] Explain how shadows are formed by opaque objects blocking light
- [ ] Predict and test how shadow size changes with distance
- [ ] Draw a ray diagram showing how we see objects (light source -> object -> eye)

**Key question displayed Week 2:** "What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?" (CL001) transitioning to "What caused this to happen?" (CL002)

---

### Lesson 6 -- Contact and Non-Contact Forces (Retrieval from Y3)
**Monday, Period 1**

**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C025 (Contact and Non-Contact Forces) -- retrieval from Y3
**Cluster:** SC-KS2-D006-CL001 (Identify and compare contact and non-contact forces)
**Objectives:** SC-KS2-O031 (contact forces vs magnetic forces at a distance)
**Thinking Lens:** Patterns -- "What patterns can we find when sorting forces?"

**Lesson structure:**

1. **(5 min) Retrieval starter -- interleaved with Light.**
   One Light question (spaced practice): "Draw a ray diagram showing how you see the board."
   One Forces activation: "Write down every PUSH or PULL you have done today."

2. **(15 min) Sorting forces -- the organising framework.**
   Provide 12 force scenario cards. Pupils sort into two categories (no labels given initially):
   - Kicking a ball, sliding on ice, braking a bicycle, rubbing hands together (contact)
   - Dropping a ball, magnet attracting a nail, static electricity pulling hair (non-contact)
   Thinking Lens -- Patterns: "What do the forces in each group have in common? What is the pattern?"
   Reveal categories: CONTACT forces (objects must touch) vs. NON-CONTACT forces (act at a distance).
   Interaction type: Drag to Categorise.

3. **(15 min) Demonstrations.**
   Contact forces: Push a book across the desk. Pull a bag. Feel friction when rubbing hands.
   Non-contact forces: Drop a ball (gravity -- no touching). Attract a paper clip with a magnet (no touching). Rub a balloon on hair, then hold near small paper pieces (static).
   Use force arrows on simple whiteboard diagrams to show direction and type.
   Teaching guidance from C025: "Create a two-column sorting activity: 'forces that need touching' versus 'forces that act at a distance'."
   Address misconception from C025: "Gravity only acts on heavy objects" -- gravity acts on ALL objects with mass.

4. **(10 min) Key vocabulary and evidence wall.**
   CV001 key vocabulary: friction, force, contact force, surface, fair test, variable, conclusion.
   Additional from C025: push, pull, contact, non-contact, gravity, magnetic, direction.
   Thinking Lens -- Evidence and Argument (secondary for CL001): "What EVIDENCE would you need to PROVE that magnetism is a non-contact force?"

5. **(5 min) Exit ticket.**
   "Name 3 contact forces and 2 non-contact forces. Explain the difference."
   Prerequisite check for D013 (Y5 Forces next half-term): pupils must have the contact/non-contact framework secure. SC-KS2-C025 is a prerequisite of SC-KS2-C055 (Gravity).

**Equipment checklist:** Force scenario cards x12 (laminated), ball, magnets x2, balloon, paper pieces, whiteboard.

---

### Lesson 7 -- Friction Investigation (CV001 Core Practical)
**Tuesday, Period 1**

**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C027 (Friction and Movement on Surfaces) -- retrieval from Y3; fair test is the CV001 investigation
**Cluster:** SC-KS2-D006-CL001
**Objectives:** SC-KS2-O030 (compare how things move on different surfaces)
**WS focus:** WS-KS2-003 (Planning enquiries and controlling variables), WS-KS2-005 (Recording data in varied formats) -- both linked to C027 via disciplinary skills
**Thinking Lens:** Cause and Effect -- "What CAUSES the car to travel different distances?"
**Enquiry type:** fair_test (from CV001)

**Lesson structure:**

1. **(5 min) Investigation question and prediction.**
   "How does the surface type affect how far a toy car travels?"
   Thinking Lens: "IF we change the surface, THEN what will happen to the distance, BECAUSE...?"
   Pupils write predictions.

2. **(10 min) Planning the fair test -- using CV001 structured variables.**
   **Variables (from CV001):**
   - Independent: surface type (carpet, wood, sandpaper, tile, fabric)
   - Dependent: distance travelled by toy car (cm)
   - Controlled: ramp angle, car mass, release point, same car

   CV001 success criterion 1: "Identify the independent, dependent, and controlled variables."
   Pupils complete a planning frame with their identified variables. Check understanding: "What would happen if we used a different car for each surface? Would it still be fair?"
   Cross-domain link (from graph): SC-KS2-C027 links to MA-Y3-C015 -- measurement skills. Ensure pupils can read a metre stick accurately in cm.

3. **(25 min) Practical investigation.**
   Equipment (from CV001): ramp, toy car, metre stick, surface samples (carpet, wood, sandpaper, tile, fabric), masking tape.
   Safety (from CV001): "Low risk. Ensure ramp is stable and surfaces are secured flat."
   Each pair tests 5 surfaces x 3 repeats = 15 runs.
   **Recording format (from CV001):** Results table:
   | Surface | Distance trial 1 (cm) | Distance trial 2 (cm) | Distance trial 3 (cm) | Mean (cm) |

   CV001 success criterion 2: "Measure distance travelled accurately using standard units."

4. **(10 min) Results and pattern identification.**
   **Recording format (from CV001):** "table of results -> bar chart -> written conclusion"
   Begin bar chart (surface on x-axis [categorical], mean distance on y-axis).
   CV001 expected outcome: "Rougher surfaces produce more friction, so the car travels a shorter distance. Smooth surfaces produce less friction."
   Thinking Lens -- Patterns: "What pattern do you notice? Can you predict what would happen on a DIFFERENT surface?"

5. **(5 min) Conclusion using the Cause and Effect frame.**
   "The car travels a shorter distance on rough surfaces BECAUSE friction is greater. Friction is a CONTACT force that opposes motion."
   CV001 success criterion 4: "Explain results using the concept of friction."

**Equipment checklist:** Ramps x8, toy cars x8 (identical), metre sticks x8, surface samples (carpet 30cm square, smooth wood, sandpaper, floor tile, fabric) x8 sets, masking tape, graph paper.

---

### Lesson 8 -- Magnetic Materials Investigation
**Wednesday, Period 1**

**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C026 (Magnetic Properties) -- retrieval and extension
**Cluster:** SC-KS2-D006-CL002 (Investigate the properties and uses of magnets)
**Objectives:** SC-KS2-O032 (magnets attract/repel), SC-KS2-O033 (magnetic and non-magnetic materials)
**WS focus:** WS-KS2-004 (Classifying and identifying patterns)
**Thinking Lens:** Cause and Effect -- "What causes some materials to be attracted to magnets and not others?"

**Lesson structure:**

1. **(5 min) Retrieval starter -- interleaved with Friction.**
   "Draw a labelled diagram showing the forces acting on a toy car on a ramp." (Gravity pulling down, friction opposing motion -- links C025 and C027.)
   "What type of force is magnetism: contact or non-contact?" (Non-contact -- C025.)

2. **(20 min) Systematic material testing.**
   Equipment: bar magnets x15, collection of materials (iron nail, copper coin, aluminium foil, steel paper clip, brass key, wooden block, plastic ruler, fabric, glass marble, nickel coin).
   Teaching guidance from C026: "Challenge pupils to predict and then test which materials are attracted to magnets, recording results in a table."
   Recording format: Prediction table then results table:
   | Material | Prediction (Y/N) | Result (Y/N) | Metal? |

   Key finding (from C026 teaching guidance): "Only iron, nickel, cobalt and their alloys (e.g., steel) are magnetic -- copper, aluminium, gold and silver are NOT."
   Address misconception (from C026): "All metals are magnetic" -- test the copper coin, aluminium foil, and brass key to disprove this directly.
   Thinking Lens -- Patterns: "What pattern do you notice about which materials are magnetic?"

3. **(15 min) Magnetic force through materials.**
   Investigation (from C026 teaching guidance): "Test whether magnetic force acts through materials (paper, wood, plastic, water) by trying to move a paper clip through a table."
   This demonstrates that magnetism is a genuine non-contact force -- it works through solid barriers.
   Thinking Lens -- Cause and Effect: "What CAUSES the paper clip to move even though the magnet is not touching it?"

4. **(5 min) Key terminology and magnet types.**
   Introduce magnet types (from C026 teaching guidance): bar magnet, horseshoe magnet, ring magnet.
   Address misconception from C026: "Bigger magnets are always stronger" -- not necessarily; depends on material and magnetisation.

5. **(5 min) Exit ticket.**
   "Name 3 magnetic materials and 3 non-magnetic metals. Explain why 'all metals are magnetic' is wrong."
   CV001 assessment check (adapted for magnets): Can pupils classify materials as magnetic or non-magnetic with evidence?

**Equipment checklist:** Bar magnets x15, horseshoe magnets x5, material collections x15 sets (iron nail, copper coin, aluminium foil, steel paper clip, brass key, wooden block, plastic ruler, fabric, glass marble, nickel coin), paper clips x30.

### Lesson 9 -- Magnetic Poles and Fields
**Thursday, Period 1**

**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C026 (Magnetic Properties) -- poles, fields, attraction and repulsion
**Cluster:** SC-KS2-D006-CL002
**Objectives:** SC-KS2-O034 (magnets have two poles), SC-KS2-O035 (predict attract/repel)
**WS focus:** WS-KS2-004 (Classifying and identifying patterns)
**Thinking Lens:** Patterns -- "What patterns can you find in how magnets behave?"

**Lesson structure:**

1. **(5 min) Retrieval starter -- spaced practice from Week 1.**
   "Draw a ray diagram showing why a shadow forms behind an opaque object." (Light, spaced 4 days.)
   "Name 2 magnetic materials and explain how you know." (Magnets, yesterday.)

2. **(15 min) Poles investigation.**
   Equipment: bar magnets x15 (clearly labelled N and S), string for suspending.
   Teaching guidance from C026: "Demonstrate that like poles repel and unlike poles attract using bar magnets on a smooth surface or suspended from string."
   Pairs systematically test all combinations: N-N, N-S, S-N, S-S. Record in table:
   | Pole 1 | Pole 2 | Result (attract/repel) |
   Thinking Lens -- Patterns: "What is the PATTERN? Can you now PREDICT what will happen before you test?"
   CV001 format adapted: observation table -> pattern statement.

3. **(15 min) Visualising the magnetic field.**
   Equipment: iron filings, paper, bar magnets.
   Teaching guidance from C026: "Explore the magnetic field using iron filings on paper above a bar magnet."
   Safety: iron filings are fine particles -- do NOT inhale. Keep paper between filings and magnet (recovery is easier). Wash hands after handling. Teacher demonstrates first.
   Observe the field pattern. Where are the filings densest? At the poles.
   Address misconception from C026: "Magnets are strongest in the middle" -- strength is at the poles, as shown by the filing concentration.

4. **(10 min) Compass connection.**
   Suspend a bar magnet from string -- it settles pointing north-south.
   Explain: Earth has a magnetic field. A compass is a suspended magnet.
   Extension: make a simple compass by magnetising a needle and floating it on water (from C026 teaching guidance).

5. **(5 min) Exit ticket.**
   "Draw two magnets that will ATTRACT each other. Label the poles. Draw two that will REPEL. What is the pattern?"

**Equipment checklist:** Bar magnets x15 (N/S labelled), string, iron filings (teacher supply, use with care), A4 paper x15, compasses x5 (optional), needles x5 + cork/polystyrene + bowl of water (extension).

**Iron filings safety note (teacher addition -- NOT in CV001):** Iron filings are not listed in CV001 equipment but are described in C026 teaching guidance. They should be added to CV001. Use only under direct supervision. Place paper on magnet first, sprinkle filings on paper, do not allow pupils to handle filings directly. Return to sealed container after use.

### Lesson 10 -- Forces and Magnets Assessment
**Friday, Period 1**

**Concepts:** SC-KS2-C025, SC-KS2-C026, SC-KS2-C027 (all Forces and Magnets concepts)
**Clusters:** SC-KS2-D006-CL001 and CL002 -- consolidation
**Objectives:** All 6 Forces and Magnets objectives (O030-O035)
**Assessment format:** Practical stations (20 min) + written task (20 min)
**Aligned to CV001 success criteria + magnet assessment

**Lesson structure:**

1. **(5 min) Retrieval warm-up -- interleaved Light and Forces.**
   3 quick-fire questions mixing both topics (interleaved practice):
   - "What type of force is friction: contact or non-contact?" (Forces)
   - "Why can we see a red jumper?" (Light -- reflection)
   - "Will a magnet attract aluminium foil?" (Magnets -- no)

2. **(20 min) Practical station assessment (3 stations, 6 min each).**

   **Station 1: Sort force cards.** 12 force scenarios -- sort into contact and non-contact. Record in table. (C025)

   **Station 2: Mystery magnetic materials.** 5 unlabelled objects wrapped in paper. Predict: magnetic or not? Test with magnet. Record prediction and result. (C026)
   CV001 assessment check (adapted): "Can they explain their results using the concept of magnetic materials?"

   **Station 3: Friction challenge.** Given a toy car and ramp: "Which of these 3 surfaces will the car travel furthest on? Predict, test, explain." (C027)
   CV001 success criteria:
   - [ ] Identify the independent, dependent, and controlled variables
   - [ ] Measure distance travelled accurately using standard units
   - [ ] Explain results using the concept of friction

3. **(20 min) Written assessment.**

   **Q1 (6 marks):** "Explain why a car travels further on a smooth floor than on carpet. Use the word 'friction' and draw force arrows." (C027, CV001)

   **Q2 (4 marks):** "A magnet can pick up a steel paper clip through a piece of cardboard. Explain why this is possible. What type of force is this?" (C026, C025)

   **Q3 (4 marks):** "Correct this statement and explain why it is wrong: 'All metals are attracted to magnets.'" (C026 misconception)

   **Q4 (6 marks):** "Priya says: 'Magnets are strongest in the middle.' Amir says: 'Magnets are strongest at the ends.' Who is correct? Describe an investigation you could do to find out, and explain what you would expect to see." (C026 misconception, WS-KS2-003)

4. **(5 min) Bridge to next half-term.**
   "You now understand contact forces (friction) and non-contact forces (magnetism, gravity). Next half-term, we investigate GRAVITY in more detail -- why do things fall? What is air resistance? How do levers and pulleys work?"
   This previews D013 (Forces, Y5): SC-KS2-C055 (Gravity), SC-KS2-C056 (Resistance Forces), SC-KS2-C057 (Mechanisms).

**CV001 Success Criteria Final Checklist:**
- [ ] Identify the independent, dependent, and controlled variables
- [ ] Measure distance travelled accurately using standard units
- [ ] Record results in a table and present as a bar chart
- [ ] Explain results using the concept of friction
