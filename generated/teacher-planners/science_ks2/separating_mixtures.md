## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Extended Material Properties (SC-KS2-C047)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Comparing and grouping materials based on a wider range of properties: hardness, solubility, transparency, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and response to magnets. Builds on KS1 and Y4 materials knowledge with additional property types.

**Teaching guidance:** Set up a systematic investigation of material properties using a range of tests: scratch test for hardness (compare wood, metal, plastic, stone), dissolving test for solubility (test sugar, sand, salt, chalk in water), transparency test (classify as transparent, translucent or opaque), thermal conductivity test (wrap identical cups of hot water in different materials and measure cooling rate), electrical conductivity test (insert into a circuit gap), and magnet test. Record results in a property comparison table. Discuss how property knowledge helps engineers and designers choose the right material for each purpose.

**Key vocabulary:** property, hardness, solubility, transparency, conductivity, thermal, electrical, magnetic, opaque, translucent, transparent, dissolve, soluble, insoluble, compare, group, material, purpose

**Common misconceptions:** Children often confuse thermal conductivity with temperature — a metal spoon feels cold not because it is colder than a wooden spoon but because it conducts heat away from your hand faster. Some pupils think that if a material dissolves it has disappeared or been destroyed, rather than understanding it has dispersed into the liquid. Children may believe that hardness and strength are the same thing — glass is hard but brittle, while rubber is soft but strong.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Describing observable properties of familiar materials — hard/soft, rough/smooth, transparent/opaque — and sorting materials by one property. | Sort these materials into two groups: hard and soft. Materials: metal spoon, sponge, rubber band, stone, cotton wool, glass. | Struggling with materials that seem to fit both categories (rubber is soft but bouncy); Confusing the property of the material with the object it is made from |
| **Developing** | Comparing materials using a wider range of properties — hardness, solubility, transparency, conductivity, magnetism — and testing each property systematically. | Test these five materials for thermal conductivity. Which material would be best for keeping a drink warm? Explain how you tested. | Not using a control cup (unwrapped) for comparison; Confusing thermal conductors (transfer heat quickly) with good insulators (slow heat transfer) |
| **Expected** | Grouping materials based on multiple properties simultaneously and explaining why specific materials are chosen for specific purposes based on their properties. | A saucepan has a metal body and a plastic handle. Explain why different materials are used for each part, referring to their properties. | Only mentioning one property per material instead of explaining multiple relevant properties; Not connecting each property to the specific function of that part |
| **Greater Depth** | Evaluating materials for a design task by considering trade-offs between multiple properties. | You are designing a lunchbox. It needs to keep food cool, be lightweight, not break when dropped, and be transparent so you can see inside. No single material has all these properties. How would you solve this? | Trying to find a single material rather than combining materials; Not acknowledging the trade-offs involved in material selection |

> **Model response (Entry):** *Hard: metal spoon, stone, glass. Soft: sponge, rubber band, cotton wool.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *I wrapped identical cups of warm water in each material, measured the starting temperature, then measured again after 10 minutes. Results: cotton wool — only 2°C drop. Newspaper — 3°C drop. Plastic bag — 5°C drop. Aluminium foil — 7°C drop. Nothing (control) — 8°C drop. Cotton wool is best for keeping a drink warm because it is the poorest thermal conductor — it traps air and slows heat escaping.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *The metal body is chosen because metals are good thermal conductors — they transfer heat quickly from the hob to the food inside. Metal is also strong, rigid and has a high melting point, so it does not deform or melt at cooking temperatures. The plastic handle is chosen because plastic is a poor thermal conductor (good insulator) — it does not transfer heat to your hand, so you can hold the pan safely. Plastic is also lightweight and can be moulded into a comfortable grip shape. Each part of the saucepan uses a material whose properties match its function perfectly.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *No single material has all four properties, so I would combine materials. The main body and lid could be transparent plastic — it is lightweight, shatter-resistant, and see-through. But plastic is a poor insulator, so I would line the inside with a thin insulating layer (like foam or a reflective material) to keep food cool. The latch could be metal for strength and durability. I would need to compromise on transparency slightly — the insulating lining would cover some of the inside. This shows that real-world design involves trade-offs: you cannot maximise every property, so you prioritise the most important ones and use combinations of materials to get the best overall result.*

### Secondary concept: Dissolving and Solutions (SC-KS2-C048)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Understanding that some materials dissolve in liquid to form a solution — the solute appears to disappear but is not lost. Understanding that a dissolved substance can be recovered by evaporating the solvent. Dissolving is different from melting.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Knowing that some materials disappear when stirred into water (dissolve) and that this makes a solution. | Thinking the sugar has vanished or been destroyed; Not using the word 'dissolved' to describe what happened |
| **Developing** | Understanding that dissolving is different from melting, and that dissolved substances can be recovered by evaporating the water. | Confusing dissolving with melting — they are different processes; Thinking you cannot get a dissolved substance back |
| **Expected** | Investigating factors that affect dissolving rate (temperature, stirring, grain size) and explaining that the total mass of a solution equals the mass of solute plus solvent. | Not controlling all variables — changing temperature AND stirring rate; Not explaining why hotter water dissolves substances faster |
| **Greater Depth** | Applying dissolving knowledge to explain real-world phenomena and understanding saturation — that there is a limit to how much solute can dissolve. | Thinking the salt at the bottom has been rejected or is different from the dissolved salt; Not knowing that temperature affects how much can dissolve (solubility) |

### Secondary concept: Separating Mixtures (SC-KS2-C049)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Understanding that mixtures of solids, liquids and gases can be separated using various techniques: filtering (remove insoluble solids from liquids), sieving (separate solids by particle size), evaporating (recover dissolved solids). Technique chosen depends on properties of components.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Knowing that you can separate some mixtures, such as using a sieve to separate large pieces from small ones. | Choosing a sieve with the wrong size holes; Not recognising that the separation works because of different particle sizes |
| **Developing** | Using filtering to separate insoluble solids from liquids and evaporation to recover dissolved solids, choosing the correct method for each mixture. | Thinking filtering can remove dissolved substances (it cannot — only insoluble particles); Confusing filtering with sieving |
| **Expected** | Selecting the appropriate separation technique for different mixtures and explaining why each technique works based on the properties of the components. | Trying to filter the dry mixture (salt and sand particles are similar size, so this will not work); Forgetting the evaporation step to recover the salt from solution |
| **Greater Depth** | Applying separation knowledge to unfamiliar or multi-step problems and evaluating the effectiveness of different separation strategies. | Not recovering the water (just letting it evaporate into the air rather than condensing it); Using the steps in the wrong order, making later separations harder |

### Secondary concept: Reversible Changes (SC-KS2-C050)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Understanding that some material changes are reversible — the original materials can be recovered. Examples: dissolving, mixing, melting, freezing, evaporation, condensation. The material is changed in form but not in substance.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Knowing that some changes can be undone — for example, ice can melt and then be frozen again. | Thinking melted chocolate has permanently changed; Not connecting cooling to the reverse of melting |
| **Developing** | Understanding that reversible changes include dissolving, melting, freezing, evaporation and condensation, and that the original materials can be recovered. | Thinking dissolving is irreversible because the solid seems to disappear; Not understanding that evaporation can be reversed by condensation |
| **Expected** | Explaining what makes a change reversible — no new substance is formed — and distinguishing reversible from irreversible changes using this criterion. | Thinking baking is reversible because you can see the original ingredients; Not using the test 'has a new substance been formed?' |
| **Greater Depth** | Evaluating ambiguous cases and explaining why some changes are harder to classify than others. | Thinking physical difficulty means chemically irreversible; Not distinguishing between 'hard to reverse in practice' and 'scientifically irreversible' |

### Secondary concept: Irreversible Changes (SC-KS2-C051)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Understanding that some changes result in the formation of new materials and are not easily reversed. Examples: burning, rusting, acid reacting with bicarbonate of soda, cooking. New substances are formed that cannot easily be changed back.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Knowing that some changes cannot be undone — for example, you cannot turn a cooked egg back into a raw egg. | Thinking you could reverse it by cooling the toast; Not recognising that a new substance has been formed |
| **Developing** | Identifying signs that a new substance has been formed: colour change, gas production, temperature change, or a substance with different properties from the starting materials. | Thinking the fizzing is just air escaping; Not recognising gas production as evidence of a new substance forming |
| **Expected** | Explaining multiple examples of irreversible changes, identifying evidence that new materials have formed, and contrasting with reversible changes. | Thinking melting and burning are the same because both involve heat; Not identifying the specific new substances formed during burning |
| **Greater Depth** | Explaining irreversible changes in terms of new substances being formed with different properties, and recognising useful irreversible changes in everyday life. | Only thinking of irreversible changes as destructive (burning, rusting); Not explaining why permanence is the useful feature in each example |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Material properties link physical structure (molecular arrangement, surface texture) to functional behaviour (waterproofing, strength, flexibility) — the key question is always 'why does this material behave this way?'

**Question stems for KS2:**
- How does the shape or arrangement help it do its job?
- Can you find two different structures that do the same thing? How do they compare?
- If you were designing this, what would you keep and what would you change?
- Why is this material or structure better suited than another?

**Secondary lens:** Cause and Effect — Fair testing and investigations are designed to isolate variables and establish causal relationships — the cognitive demand is reasoning from controlled evidence to causal claims.

---

## Session structure: Fair Test

### Fair Test
The classic scientific enquiry: formulating a testable question, making a prediction based on scientific understanding, designing a method that controls variables, collecting and recording data systematically, analysing results, and drawing a conclusion linked back to the original hypothesis.

`question` → `hypothesis` → `method` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `conclusion`

**Assessment:** Structured scientific report including question, hypothesis with reasoning, method with variables identified, results table/graph, and conclusion evaluating whether results support the hypothesis.

**Teacher note:** Use the FAIR TEST template: frame a testable question and guide pupils to identify the variable they will change, measure, and keep the same. Support them in making a prediction with a scientific reason. Collect measurements using appropriate equipment and record results in a table. Guide pupils to describe patterns in their results and say whether their prediction was supported.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What is our testable question?
- What will you change, measure, and keep the same?
- What pattern can you see in your results?
- Does the evidence support your prediction? How do you know?

---

## Variables

**Independent:** separation method (filtering, sieving, evaporating, magnetic)
**Dependent:** success of separation (observation)
**Controlled:** same amount of mixture

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- salt
- sand
- water
- iron filings
- filter paper
- funnels
- sieves
- evaporating dishes
- magnets
- safety goggles

**Safety notes:** Wear safety goggles during evaporation activities. Teacher supervises all heating. Do not taste solutions or mixtures. Iron filings can irritate eyes — handle carefully and keep magnets away from electronic devices. (Hazard level: standard)

---

## Expected outcome

Different mixtures require different separation methods based on particle size and solubility. Dissolving and filtering are reversible. Burning and cooking are irreversible because new substances are formed.

**Recording format:** method diagram for each separation, results table, reversible vs irreversible sorting activity

## Enquiry type

### Fair Test
A controlled investigation where one variable is deliberately changed while all others are kept the same, to determine whether the changed variable has an effect on a measured outcome. The gold-standard enquiry type for causal questions in science.

**KS2 guidance:** At KS2, fair tests should involve tangible, observable variables. Pupils identify what they will change, measure, and keep the same. Predictions use 'I think... because...' stems. Data is recorded in tables and presented as bar charts or line graphs. Conclusions state whether the prediction was supported and give a simple causal explanation.

**Question stems:**
- How does [independent variable] affect [dependent variable]?
- Does changing [variable] make a difference to [outcome]?
- What is the relationship between [variable A] and [variable B]?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What will you change? (independent variable)
- What will you measure or observe? (dependent variable)
- What will you keep the same? (controlled variables)
- What do you predict will happen? Why?
- Was your prediction correct? What does the evidence show?

### Identifying and Classifying
An enquiry where pupils observe, identify, and sort objects, organisms, or materials into groups based on their observable characteristics. Develops careful observation, the ability to select relevant criteria for grouping, and understanding of why classification systems are useful in science.

**KS2 guidance:** At KS2, classification uses observable properties (hardness, colour, texture, size, behaviour). Pupils should use branching keys and Venn diagrams. They should understand that the same items can be classified in different ways depending on the criteria chosen. Link classification to real scientific examples (rocks, plants, animals).

**Question stems:**
- How can we sort these [items] into groups?
- What properties can we use to classify [these things]?
- Can you make a key to identify [these specimens]?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What can you observe about these [objects/organisms/materials]?
- What properties could you use to sort them?
- How have you decided which group each one belongs to?
- Could you sort them a different way? What would change?
- Can you make a key that someone else could use to identify them?

## Known misconceptions

### Melting and dissolving confusion
**What pupils may say:** Melting and dissolving are the same thing.
**Correct explanation:** Melting is a change of state caused by heating — a solid becomes a liquid (e.g. ice melts to water). Dissolving is a substance mixing into a solvent to form a solution (e.g. sugar dissolves in water). Melting involves one substance and heat; dissolving involves two substances and no heat is necessarily required. A melted substance can be recovered by cooling; a dissolved substance can be recovered by evaporating the solvent.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- What is the difference between melting chocolate and dissolving sugar?
- Does sugar melt or dissolve when you put it in tea?
- How would you recover melted butter? How would you recover dissolved salt?

### Dissolved substances disappear
**What pupils may say:** When something dissolves, it disappears — it is gone.
**Correct explanation:** When a substance dissolves, it breaks into particles too small to see, but the substance is still there in the solution. The total mass is conserved — if you weigh the water, then add and dissolve sugar, the solution weighs the same as the water plus sugar combined. The dissolved substance can be recovered by evaporating the solvent.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- If you dissolve salt in water and then weigh the solution, will it weigh more than the water alone?
- How could you prove that the salt is still in the water after it dissolves?
- Has the salt 'gone' when you can no longer see it?

### All changes are reversible
**What pupils may say:** All changes can be undone if you try hard enough.
**Correct explanation:** Some changes are reversible (melting, dissolving, evaporating — the original substances can be recovered). Other changes are irreversible — they form new substances that cannot be changed back to the originals. Burning, cooking, and rusting are irreversible. The key test is: can you get the original substances back? If new substances are formed, the change is irreversible.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- Can you un-cook an egg? Why not?
- Give an example of a reversible change and an irreversible change.
- What makes a change irreversible? What is formed that was not there before?

## Why this study matters

Fair testing separation methods gives pupils authentic problem-solving experience — they must choose the right technique for each mixture based on the properties of its components. This builds the critical KS2 skill of using scientific knowledge to make predictions and plan investigations, while the reversible/irreversible distinction develops understanding of chemical change.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils confuse dissolving and melting — dissolving involves a solute and solvent at the same temperature; melting involves a state change caused by heat
2. Pupils think dissolved substances have 'disappeared' — demonstrate recovery by evaporation to prove the substance is still there
3. Difficulty distinguishing reversible from irreversible changes — use concrete paired examples (ice melting vs egg cooking)

## Working scientifically skills (KS2)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Asking questions** — Posing simple questions about observations and recognising that different types of question require different approaches to find an answer, including tests, observations over time, and looking in books.
- **Observing closely** — Using the senses and simple equipment such as magnifying glasses to make careful first-hand observations of objects, organisms and phenomena.
- **Performing simple tests** — Carrying out simple practical investigations to explore questions, with early awareness that some things should be kept the same while one thing is changed.
- **Identifying and classifying** — Sorting and grouping objects, organisms or materials according to their observable characteristics, recognising that things can be classified in more than one way depending on which features are selected.
- **Using observations to suggest answers** — Making connections between what has been observed and possible answers to questions, explaining reasoning in accessible language and recognising when observations support or challenge initial ideas.
- **Gathering and recording data** — Collecting information from observations or tests and presenting it in simple forms including drawings, labelled diagrams, tables and pictograms to support answering a scientific question.
