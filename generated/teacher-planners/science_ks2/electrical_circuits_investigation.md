## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **3 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Series Electrical Circuits (SC-KS2-C041)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Understanding that a simple series electrical circuit consists of components (cells, bulbs, switches, buzzers, wires) connected in a single unbroken loop. A lamp will only light when part of a complete circuit. In Year 6, circuits can be represented using standard symbols.

**Teaching guidance:** Provide circuit-building kits (cells, wires, bulbs, switches, buzzers, motors) and challenge pupils to make a bulb light up. Investigate what happens when the circuit is broken — the bulb goes out, demonstrating the need for a complete loop. Add switches and discuss their function as deliberate circuit breakers. In Year 4, use pictorial representations of circuits. In Year 6, introduce standard circuit symbols and teach pupils to draw and interpret circuit diagrams. Investigate what happens when more bulbs or more cells are added to a series circuit.

**Key vocabulary:** circuit, series, cell, battery, wire, bulb, switch, buzzer, motor, loop, complete, break, component, electrical, current, flow, symbol, diagram

**Common misconceptions:** The most persistent misconception is that electricity 'flows out of' the battery into the bulb and is 'used up'. In fact, current flows in a complete loop and is not consumed — energy is transferred, not the charge itself. Some pupils think electricity flows from both ends of the battery and meets in the bulb ('clashing currents' model). Children may believe that the order of components in a series circuit matters — it does not for a simple series circuit.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Building a simple circuit with a cell, wires and a bulb to make the bulb light, with teacher guidance. | Use a cell, two wires and a bulb to make the bulb light up. | Connecting both wires to the same end of the cell; Not completing the circuit (leaving a gap) |
| **Developing** | Understanding that a circuit must be a complete loop for electricity to flow, and adding components like switches and buzzers. | Why does the bulb go out when you disconnect one wire? Add a switch to your circuit. | Thinking electricity 'leaks out' through the gap; Not understanding that a switch is a controlled gap |
| **Expected** | Constructing series circuits with multiple components, using standard circuit symbols in Y6, and predicting what happens when components are added or removed. | Draw a circuit diagram for a circuit with a battery, a switch, two bulbs and a buzzer, all in series. What will happen if one bulb is removed? | Drawing components floating rather than connected in a loop; Not knowing the standard circuit symbols |
| **Greater Depth** | Explaining the flow model of electricity in a circuit, understanding that current is the same throughout a series circuit, and correcting common misconceptions. | A pupil says the first bulb in a series circuit is brighter because it 'uses up' some electricity before it reaches the second bulb. Is this correct? Explain. | Believing the first bulb gets more electricity; Confusing current (flow of charge, conserved) with energy (transferred at each component) |

> **Model response (Entry):** *Child connects one wire from the cell to the bulb and another wire from the bulb back to the cell, completing the circuit. The bulb lights up.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *The bulb goes out because the circuit is broken — there is a gap in the loop so electricity cannot flow all the way around. A switch works by opening and closing the gap in the circuit. When the switch is closed, the circuit is complete and the bulb lights. When the switch is open, there is a gap and the bulb goes off.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Circuit diagram using standard symbols: battery (two long and short parallel lines), switch (break in line), two bulbs (circles with crosses), buzzer (semicircle), all connected in a single loop by straight lines. If one bulb is removed, the circuit is broken because removing a component creates a gap. The other bulb goes off and the buzzer stops. In a series circuit, all components are in one loop, so breaking it anywhere stops everything.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *This is incorrect. In a series circuit, the current (flow of charge) is the same everywhere — it is not 'used up' by the first bulb. Both bulbs receive the same current and glow equally bright. What is 'used' is energy — each bulb converts electrical energy to light and heat, reducing the voltage available for the rest of the circuit. That is why two bulbs in series are both dimmer than one bulb alone — the voltage is shared between them. But the current itself flows in a complete loop and is not consumed. The 'using up' misconception comes from confusing current with energy. A good analogy: water flowing in a circular pipe system passes through two water wheels — the same amount of water flows through each wheel, but each wheel takes some energy from the water.*

### Secondary concept: Conductors and Insulators (SC-KS2-C042)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Understanding that some materials allow electricity to flow through them (conductors) while others do not (insulators). Metals tend to be good conductors. Insulators are used to protect us from electrical current and to prevent short circuits.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Testing materials to find out which ones let electricity flow through them (complete the circuit) and which do not. | Not testing all the materials; Recording results inconsistently |
| **Developing** | Using the terms conductor and insulator correctly and identifying that metals are generally good conductors. | Mixing up conductor and insulator; Not noticing the metal/non-metal pattern |
| **Expected** | Explaining why electrical wires are made of metal covered in plastic, and understanding the practical importance of conductors and insulators for safety. | Explaining conductors without mentioning why insulators are needed for safety; Not recognising that the design choice is about directing current safely |
| **Greater Depth** | Recognising exceptions to the metals-conduct rule and explaining why some materials are used specifically for their electrical properties. | Thinking the exception disproves the general rule rather than showing it has limits; Not testing properly (the pencil line needs to be thick and continuous) |

### Secondary concept: Voltage and Circuit Effects (SC-KS2-C043)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Understanding that the brightness of a lamp and the volume of a buzzer are associated with the number and voltage of cells in a circuit. More cells/higher voltage produces brighter bulbs and louder buzzers. Voltage is introduced informally.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Knowing that adding more cells (batteries) makes a bulb brighter. | Not noticing the brightness change; Thinking the bulb gets brighter because the circuit is bigger |
| **Developing** | Understanding that more cells provide more 'push' (voltage) to the electricity, making bulbs brighter and buzzers louder. | Not linking brightness to voltage; Confusing voltage with current |
| **Expected** | Investigating the effect of changing the number of cells or components in a series circuit, and explaining that adding more bulbs makes each one dimmer because the voltage is shared. | Thinking adding a bulb 'uses up' electricity rather than sharing the voltage; Not understanding that the total voltage is fixed by the cells |
| **Greater Depth** | Predicting and explaining circuit behaviour, including the relationship between cells, bulbs and brightness, and recognising the limitations of the simple model. | Not warning that too much voltage can damage components; Thinking adding components always makes things brighter |

### Secondary concept: Circuit Symbols and Diagrams (SC-KS2-C068)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Using recognised standard symbols to represent components in circuit diagrams: cell, battery, bulb, switch, buzzer, wire. Ability to draw and interpret circuit diagrams using standard symbols, building on pictorial representations from Year 4.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Drawing simple pictures of circuits, showing the components connected in a loop. | Drawing components that are not connected in a complete loop; Forgetting to include the wires that complete the circuit |
| **Developing** | Learning the standard circuit symbols for common components and beginning to use them in place of pictures. | Confusing the cell symbol with the battery symbol (battery = multiple cells); Drawing the bulb symbol without the cross inside |
| **Expected** | Drawing and interpreting complete circuit diagrams using standard symbols, and building circuits from diagrams. | Drawing components floating rather than on the wire lines; Not using a neat rectangular layout with components on the sides |
| **Greater Depth** | Using circuit diagrams to predict circuit behaviour, identifying faults from diagrams, and understanding why standard symbols are important for scientific communication. | Not systematically checking each component and connection; Forgetting that in a series circuit, one break affects all components |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Fair testing and investigations are designed to isolate variables and establish causal relationships — the cognitive demand is reasoning from controlled evidence to causal claims.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- What caused this to happen?
- How could we check if that is the reason?
- Is there more than one reason?
- What would happen if we changed just one thing?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — This cluster asks pupils to gather, record or communicate scientific findings — the core cognitive demand is evaluating what counts as valid evidence and how to present it clearly.

---

## Session structure: Fair Test

### Fair Test
The classic scientific enquiry: formulating a testable question, making a prediction based on scientific understanding, designing a method that controls variables, collecting and recording data systematically, analysing results, and drawing a conclusion linked back to the original hypothesis.

`question` → `hypothesis` → `method` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `conclusion`

**Assessment:** Structured scientific report including question, hypothesis with reasoning, method with variables identified, results table/graph, and conclusion evaluating whether results support the hypothesis.

**Teacher note:** Use the FAIR TEST template: frame a testable question and guide pupils to identify the variable they will change, measure, and keep the same. Support them in making a prediction with a scientific reason. Collect measurements using appropriate equipment and record results in a table. Guide pupils to describe patterns in their results and say whether their prediction was supported.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What is our testable question?
- What will you change, measure, and keep the same?
- What pattern can you see in your results?
- Does the evidence support your prediction? How do you know?

---

## Variables

**Independent:** number of batteries (voltage) or number of bulbs
**Dependent:** brightness of bulb
**Controlled:** same type of bulb, same wire length, same circuit design

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- batteries (1.5V cells)
- bulbs
- buzzers
- wires with crocodile clips
- switches
- materials for conductor/insulator testing

**Safety notes:** Use only low-voltage cells (1.5V). Never connect directly across battery terminals (short circuit risk — wires can get hot). Do not use mains electricity. Ensure pupils understand the difference between safe classroom circuits and dangerous mains electricity. (Hazard level: standard)

---

## Expected outcome

More batteries = brighter bulb (more voltage). More bulbs in series = dimmer each bulb. Metals conduct; plastic, rubber, wood insulate. Circuits need a complete loop for current to flow.

**Recording format:** circuit diagrams using symbols, results table, conclusion

---

## Enquiry type

### Fair Test
A controlled investigation where one variable is deliberately changed while all others are kept the same, to determine whether the changed variable has an effect on a measured outcome. The gold-standard enquiry type for causal questions in science.

**KS2 guidance:** At KS2, fair tests should involve tangible, observable variables. Pupils identify what they will change, measure, and keep the same. Predictions use 'I think... because...' stems. Data is recorded in tables and presented as bar charts or line graphs. Conclusions state whether the prediction was supported and give a simple causal explanation.

**Question stems:**
- How does [independent variable] affect [dependent variable]?
- Does changing [variable] make a difference to [outcome]?
- What is the relationship between [variable A] and [variable B]?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What will you change? (independent variable)
- What will you measure or observe? (dependent variable)
- What will you keep the same? (controlled variables)
- What do you predict will happen? Why?
- Was your prediction correct? What does the evidence show?

## Known misconceptions

### Electricity is used up
**What pupils may say:** Electricity is used up by the bulb — it gets used up as it goes around the circuit.
**Correct explanation:** Electric current flows around a complete circuit and is the same at all points in a series circuit. The bulb transfers electrical energy to light and thermal energy, but the current itself is not consumed. What is transferred is energy, not electricity. An ammeter would show the same reading before and after the bulb.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- If you put an ammeter before the bulb and one after the bulb in a series circuit, what would you expect to see?
- What happens to the electricity after it goes through the bulb?
- Is it electricity or energy that is 'used up'?

### Single wire circuit
**What pupils may say:** A single wire from the battery to the bulb is enough to make it light up.
**Correct explanation:** A complete circuit (loop) is needed for current to flow. The current must travel from one terminal of the battery, through the bulb, and back to the other terminal. A single wire provides a path in one direction only — without a return path, no current flows and the bulb does not light.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- Draw how you would connect a battery to a bulb to make it light.
- Why does a bulb have two contact points?
- What happens to the current after it passes through the bulb?

## Why this study matters

Electricity provides an ideal context for fair testing because pupils can systematically vary one component and immediately observe the effect on brightness. Building and troubleshooting real circuits develops practical skills alongside conceptual understanding of complete loops and conductors/insulators.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils think electricity is 'used up' by the bulb — current flows around a complete circuit and is not consumed
2. Connecting wires incorrectly and concluding 'it doesn't work' — teach systematic troubleshooting of circuit connections
3. Confusing voltage (push) with current (flow) — use a water pipe analogy at KS2 level

## Sensitive content

- Emphasise that mains electricity is extremely dangerous — pupils must NEVER experiment with mains sockets or plug sockets
- Only use low-voltage cells (1.5V) in classroom activities

## Working scientifically skills (KS2)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Asking questions** — Posing simple questions about observations and recognising that different types of question require different approaches to find an answer, including tests, observations over time, and looking in books.
- **Observing closely** — Using the senses and simple equipment such as magnifying glasses to make careful first-hand observations of objects, organisms and phenomena.
- **Performing simple tests** — Carrying out simple practical investigations to explore questions, with early awareness that some things should be kept the same while one thing is changed.
- **Identifying and classifying** — Sorting and grouping objects, organisms or materials according to their observable characteristics, recognising that things can be classified in more than one way depending on which features are selected.
- **Using observations to suggest answers** — Making connections between what has been observed and possible answers to questions, explaining reasoning in accessible language and recognising when observations support or challenge initial ideas.
- **Gathering and recording data** — Collecting information from observations or tests and presenting it in simple forms including drawings, labelled diagrams, tables and pictograms to support answering a scientific question.
