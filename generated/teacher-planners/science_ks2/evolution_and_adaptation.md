## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **3 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Fossils as Evidence of Change Over Time (SC-KS2-C063)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Understanding that fossils (introduced in Y3 as trapped remains in rock) provide evidence that living things have changed over time and that animals and plants that no longer exist once lived on Earth millions of years ago.

**Teaching guidance:** Revisit fossil knowledge from Year 3 and extend it to the concept of change over time. Compare fossils of extinct organisms with their closest living relatives — for example, ammonites with modern nautilus, trilobites with modern woodlice. Use a geological timeline to show when major groups appeared and disappeared. Discuss what fossils tell us: the types of organisms that existed, the environments they lived in, and how life has changed over millions of years. Link to Darwin's use of fossil evidence in developing his theory of evolution. Examine the concept of extinction — why species disappear and what causes it.

**Key vocabulary:** fossil, evidence, extinct, change, time, millions of years, species, organism, geological, ancient, remains, compare, ancestor, descendant, evolution, palaeontology

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think dinosaurs and humans lived at the same time. Dinosaurs became extinct approximately 66 million years ago; modern humans appeared around 300,000 years ago. Some pupils believe that fossils are only of dinosaurs, not recognising the vast range of fossilised organisms (plants, shells, fish, insects). Children may think that if a species goes extinct, it was somehow 'inferior', rather than understanding that extinction results from environmental change exceeding a species' ability to adapt.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Knowing that fossils show us animals and plants that lived long ago, and that some of them no longer exist (are extinct). | Look at this ammonite fossil. What does it tell us? | Thinking fossils are just old rocks with no connection to living things; Not understanding that extinction means the species no longer exists anywhere |
| **Developing** | Understanding that fossils provide evidence that living things have changed over time — organisms that lived millions of years ago were different from those alive today. | Scientists have found fossils of sea creatures on top of mountains. What does this tell us? | Thinking the sea creatures climbed the mountains; Not connecting the fossils to environmental change over geological time |
| **Expected** | Using fossil evidence to explain that organisms have changed over time, comparing fossils with living organisms, and understanding what fossils reveal about past environments. | Compare a fossil of an ancient horse (Eohippus, the size of a dog with four toes) with a modern horse. What does this comparison suggest? | Thinking the ancient horse turned into the modern horse during its lifetime; Not using the fossil evidence to support the argument |
| **Greater Depth** | Evaluating fossil evidence critically — understanding gaps in the fossil record and why not all organisms fossilise — and explaining how fossils support the theory of evolution. | Why do we not have fossils of every species that has ever lived? Does this weaken the evidence for evolution? | Thinking gaps in the fossil record disprove evolution; Not understanding why fossilisation is rare |

> **Model response (Entry):** *This fossil shows an animal that lived a very long time ago. It looks like a spiral shell. This animal does not exist any more — it has gone extinct. The fossil tells us that different animals lived on Earth in the past.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *This tells us that the land where the mountains are now was once under the sea. Over millions of years, the sea floor was pushed up to form mountains, carrying the fossils with it. This is evidence that the Earth's surface has changed dramatically over time, and that the environments where organisms lived have changed too. Life on Earth has changed alongside these changes — the sea creatures that made those fossils are long extinct.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Eohippus (about 55 million years ago) was small (about 40cm tall, dog-sized), had four toes on each front foot, and had teeth suited to eating soft leaves in forests. Modern horses are much larger (about 160cm), have a single hoof on each foot, and have teeth suited to grinding tough grass on open plains. The fossil record shows a gradual series of changes between the two: increasing body size, reduction in toe number, and changes in tooth structure. This evidence suggests that horses have evolved over millions of years, changing as their environment changed from forests to grasslands. The intermediate fossils show this was not a sudden jump but a gradual process — each generation was slightly different from the last.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *We do not have fossils of every species because fossilisation requires very specific conditions: the organism must be buried quickly in sediment before it decays, and the sediment must remain undisturbed for millions of years while minerals replace the original material. Soft-bodied organisms (like jellyfish and worms) rarely fossilise because they have no hard parts. Many fossils have been destroyed by geological processes — erosion, volcanic activity, tectonic movement. So the fossil record is necessarily incomplete — like having some pages of a very long book. This does not weaken the evidence for evolution. The fossils we do have consistently show: simpler organisms in older rocks, more complex ones in newer rocks; gradual changes within lineages over time; transitional forms (like Archaeopteryx, between dinosaurs and birds). No fossil has ever been found in the wrong geological layer. The pattern is overwhelmingly consistent, even with gaps.*

### Secondary concept: Variation in Offspring (SC-KS2-C064)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Understanding that living things reproduce offspring of the same kind, but that offspring vary and are not identical to their parents or to each other. This natural variation within species is the raw material for natural selection. Genes/chromosomes not required at this stage.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Knowing that children look similar to their parents but are not identical copies — there are always some differences. | Thinking children should be exact copies of one parent; Not noticing the differences alongside the similarities |
| **Developing** | Understanding that offspring inherit characteristics from both parents, which explains both similarities and differences between family members. | Thinking siblings should look the same because they have the same parents; Confusing inherited traits with environmental ones (a scar is not inherited) |
| **Expected** | Distinguishing between inherited variation (passed from parents) and environmental variation (caused by conditions), and understanding that variation within a species is normal and important. | Thinking all characteristics are inherited; Not recognising that some traits (like height) are influenced by both inheritance and environment |
| **Greater Depth** | Explaining why variation is essential for a species' survival and connecting variation to natural selection without using genetic terminology. | Thinking the rabbits chose to become resistant; Not connecting variation to the species' ability to survive changing conditions |

### Secondary concept: Adaptation (SC-KS2-C065)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Understanding that animals and plants have features that help them survive in their particular environment. These adaptations may be structural (camouflage, body shape, insulation) or behavioural. Different environments select for different adaptations.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Knowing that animals and plants have features that help them survive in the place where they live. | Only mentioning one function (warmth) and not camouflage; Not connecting the feature to the specific environment |
| **Developing** | Identifying multiple adaptations in an organism and explaining how each helps survival in its specific environment. | Describing features without explaining how they help in that specific environment; Thinking the cactus chose to develop these features |
| **Expected** | Comparing adaptations in organisms from different environments and explaining why the same adaptation would not work everywhere. | Describing adaptations without comparing them across environments; Not explaining why an adaptation suited to one environment would fail in another |
| **Greater Depth** | Explaining that adaptations develop over many generations through natural selection, not within an individual's lifetime, and predicting how a changing environment might affect adapted organisms. | Thinking polar bears can quickly adapt to new conditions within their lifetime; Not connecting the speed of environmental change to the speed of adaptation |

### Secondary concept: Evolution (SC-KS2-C066)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Understanding that adaptation may lead to evolution — that over very long periods of time, variation and natural selection can lead to populations becoming better adapted to their environments and to the development of new species. Work of Darwin and Wallace.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Knowing that animals and plants have changed over a very long time and that some types of living things that existed before are now extinct. | Thinking extinct animals might still be alive somewhere; Confusing extinction with endangerment |
| **Developing** | Understanding that living things have gradually changed over very long periods of time (evolution) and that variation and inheritance play a role in this process. | Thinking individual mice change colour during their lifetime; Not understanding that evolution happens across populations over many generations |
| **Expected** | Explaining evolution by natural selection using the concepts of variation, inheritance and survival, with reference to Darwin and Wallace. | Saying the moths 'decided' or 'chose' to change colour; Thinking evolution has a direction or goal |
| **Greater Depth** | Evaluating the evidence for evolution from multiple sources and understanding why evolution is considered a scientific theory supported by overwhelming evidence, not 'just a guess'. | Confusing the everyday meaning of 'theory' (guess) with the scientific meaning (well-supported explanation); Not providing multiple independent lines of evidence |

## Thinking lens: Systems and System Models (primary)

**Key question:** What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?

**Why this lens fits:** Food chains, food webs and ecosystems are system models: pupils map components (producers, consumers, decomposers), trace energy flows, and predict what happens when one part changes.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- What goes into this system, and what comes out?
- If you changed this one part, what else would be affected?
- Where does this system start and end?
- How could we draw a model to explain how this works?

**Secondary lens:** Patterns — Sorting, classifying and identifying similarities directly trains pupils to recognise regularities and use them to predict or generalise.

## Session structure: Research Enquiry

### Research Enquiry
A structured approach to answering questions through secondary research. Pupils formulate a research question, select appropriate sources, take and organise notes, synthesise findings from multiple sources, and present their conclusions. Develops information literacy alongside subject knowledge.

`question` → `source_selection` → `note_taking` → `synthesis` → `presentation`

**Assessment:** Research report or presentation that answers the original question using evidence from multiple sources, with evaluation of source reliability where appropriate.

**Teacher note:** Use the RESEARCH ENQUIRY template: give pupils a clear question to research using books, websites, or other provided sources. Teach them to select relevant information, make brief notes in their own words, and organise their findings. Guide them to present what they have learned clearly, distinguishing between what different sources say.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What question are we trying to answer?
- Which sources are most useful for answering this question?
- Can you put the key information into your own words?
- What did you find out, and which source told you that?

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- fossil samples or images
- bird beak models (tweezers, pegs, chopsticks)
- seeds of different sizes
- images of adapted organisms

**Safety notes:** No specific physical hazards. Handle fossil samples with care as they can be fragile and valuable. Ensure sensitivity around evolution and creation discussions — follow school RE policy. (Hazard level: low)

---

## Expected outcome

Fossils show how organisms have changed over time. Offspring vary from parents. Organisms are adapted to their environments. Over time, natural selection means better-adapted organisms survive and reproduce more successfully.

## Enquiry type

### Pattern Seeking
An enquiry where pupils look for relationships or correlations between variables in situations where it is not possible or appropriate to control all the variables. Data is collected and analysed to determine whether there is a pattern — 'Is there a link between X and Y?' — without necessarily establishing causation.

**KS2 guidance:** At KS2, pattern seeking involves gathering observations across multiple examples and looking for trends. Pupils may rank, sort, or graph data to reveal patterns. Explanations describe the pattern and offer a possible reason. Examples: pitch and length of vibrating object, reactivity of metals, shadow size and distance.

**Question stems:**
- Is there a pattern between [variable A] and [variable B]?
- Do [things with property X] also tend to [show property Y]?
- Can you put these in order of [property] and see what pattern emerges?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- Is there a pattern between [variable A] and [variable B]?
- What do you notice when you compare [these examples]?
- Can you put these in order? What pattern emerges?
- Why might this pattern exist?
- Does the pattern always hold, or are there exceptions?

### Research Using Secondary Sources
An enquiry where pupils answer scientific questions using information from books, websites, databases, and other secondary sources rather than first-hand investigation. Used when the question cannot be answered by practical investigation in the classroom (e.g. space, evolution, body systems, historical scientific discoveries).

**KS2 guidance:** At KS2, research enquiries should use age-appropriate sources. Pupils should be guided to check whether information comes from a reliable source. Note-taking should be in the pupil's own words. Presentation formats include posters, labelled diagrams, short reports, and timelines. Topics often include evolution, the solar system, and human body systems.

**Question stems:**
- What does the evidence tell us about [topic]?
- How do scientists explain [phenomenon]?
- What do we know about [topic] and how do we know it?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What question are we trying to answer?
- Where can we find reliable information about this?
- What are the key facts and ideas from this source?
- Do different sources agree? If not, why might they differ?
- What is the answer to our question, based on the evidence?

## Known misconceptions

### Evolution is individual choice
**What pupils may say:** Evolution means an animal chose to change — the giraffe stretched its neck to reach leaves.
**Correct explanation:** Evolution happens to populations over many generations, not to individual organisms during their lifetime. Individual organisms do not choose to evolve. Instead, random genetic variation means some individuals are better adapted than others. Those better-adapted individuals are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their advantageous traits. Over many generations, these traits become more common in the population. This is natural selection.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- If a giraffe stretches its neck during its lifetime, will its babies have longer necks?
- Does evolution happen to one animal or to a whole population?
- What is the difference between an animal changing during its life and evolution?

### Humans evolved from monkeys
**What pupils may say:** Humans evolved from modern monkeys.
**Correct explanation:** Humans did not evolve from any modern ape or monkey species. Humans and modern apes (chimpanzees, gorillas, etc.) share a common ancestor that lived millions of years ago. Both lineages have evolved since then. Humans are not 'more evolved' than apes — both are equally adapted to their environments. The evolutionary tree is branching, not linear.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- If humans evolved from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?
- What do scientists mean when they say humans and chimpanzees share a 'common ancestor'?
- Is evolution like a ladder (with humans at the top) or like a branching tree?

## Why this study matters

Research enquiry combined with hands-on modelling (the bird beak simulation) helps pupils understand natural selection through concrete experience rather than abstract explanation. The bird beak activity transforms a complex concept into a physical investigation where pupils can see variation, competition, and differential survival in action.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils think individual organisms evolve during their lifetime — evolution happens across populations over many generations
2. Confusing adaptation (a trait that helps survival) with acclimatisation (a short-term response) — use clear examples
3. Pupils may think evolution is a deliberate choice by organisms ('the giraffe stretched its neck') — emphasise random variation and natural selection

## Sensitive content

- Evolution can conflict with some religious beliefs — present it as the scientific explanation supported by evidence, while being respectful of pupils' faith backgrounds
- Focus on evidence and the scientific process rather than making value judgements about beliefs

## Working scientifically skills (KS2)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Asking questions** — Posing simple questions about observations and recognising that different types of question require different approaches to find an answer, including tests, observations over time, and looking in books.
- **Observing closely** — Using the senses and simple equipment such as magnifying glasses to make careful first-hand observations of objects, organisms and phenomena.
- **Performing simple tests** — Carrying out simple practical investigations to explore questions, with early awareness that some things should be kept the same while one thing is changed.
- **Identifying and classifying** — Sorting and grouping objects, organisms or materials according to their observable characteristics, recognising that things can be classified in more than one way depending on which features are selected.
- **Using observations to suggest answers** — Making connections between what has been observed and possible answers to questions, explaining reasoning in accessible language and recognising when observations support or challenge initial ideas.
- **Gathering and recording data** — Collecting information from observations or tests and presenting it in simple forms including drawings, labelled diagrams, tables and pictograms to support answering a scientific question.
