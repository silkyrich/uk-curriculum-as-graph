## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **3 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Light and Vision (SC-KS2-C022)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Understanding that light is needed to see — dark is the absence of light. In Year 3, this is the observable phenomenon; in Year 6, it is explained using the model that light travels in straight lines from sources to eyes or via reflection.

**Teaching guidance:** Create a dark den or use a blacked-out area to explore the concept that we need light to see. Demonstrate that in complete darkness we cannot see at all — dark is the absence of light, not a substance. Introduce the idea that we see objects because light from a source reaches our eyes — either directly from a light source (sun, lamp, candle) or after reflecting off objects. Discuss sun safety: never look directly at the sun. Compare objects that produce their own light (luminous — sun, torch, candle) with those that reflect light (non-luminous — moon, most objects).

**Key vocabulary:** light, dark, light source, luminous, reflect, shadow, see, eye, torch, candle, sun, absence, visible, darkness, bright, dim

**Common misconceptions:** The most common misconception is that we can see in complete darkness if we 'wait long enough for our eyes to adjust'. In complete darkness (no light at all), we cannot see anything. Children often believe the Moon produces its own light — it reflects sunlight. Some pupils think darkness is a substance that can be 'pushed away' by light, rather than understanding darkness as the absence of light.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Knowing that we need light to see things and that it is dark when there is no light. | Why can you not see in a completely dark room? | Thinking we can see in the dark if we wait long enough; Thinking dark is a substance rather than the absence of light |
| **Developing** | Identifying sources of light (Sun, lamp, fire, torch) and understanding that we see objects because light from a source reaches our eyes, either directly or by bouncing off objects. | Name three light sources. How do we see a book in a lit room? | Thinking our eyes produce light that goes out to objects (emission theory); Thinking the Moon is a light source (it reflects sunlight) |
| **Expected** | Explaining how we see objects using the model that light travels from a source, reflects off objects and enters our eyes. Understanding that darkness is the absence of light. | Draw and label a diagram showing how we see a red apple when a lamp is on. Include the light source, the apple and the eye. | Drawing arrows going from the eye to the object (the emission misconception); Not including the reflection step — going directly from source to eye |
| **Greater Depth** | Applying the light-and-vision model to explain everyday phenomena and recognising its development from Y3 observation to Y6 straight-line model. | Explain why you can see the Moon at night even though it is not a light source. Use the model of how we see things. | Thinking the Moon makes its own light; Not connecting moonlight to sunlight reflection |

> **Model response (Entry):** *Because there is no light. We need light to see things.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Light sources: the Sun, a lamp, a candle. We see the book because light from the lamp shines onto the book, bounces off the book's surface, and enters our eyes. Without the light reaching our eyes, we would not see the book.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Diagram shows: lamp (light source) with arrows going to the apple, then arrows bouncing off the apple going to the eye. Labels: 'Light from the lamp travels to the apple', 'Light reflects off the apple's surface (red light reflects, other colours are absorbed)', 'Reflected light enters the eye, and we see a red apple'. In a dark room with no light source, no light reaches the apple or our eyes, so we see nothing.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *The Moon is not a light source — it does not produce its own light. We can see it because sunlight hits the Moon's surface and reflects off it. This reflected sunlight then travels through space to Earth and enters our eyes. We see the Moon the same way we see a book — by reflected light from a source. The light source is the Sun, even though the Sun is not visible to us at night (it is on the other side of Earth). This explains why the Moon's appearance changes through the month — we see different amounts of the sunlit side as the Moon orbits Earth.*

### Secondary concept: Reflection of Light (SC-KS2-C023)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Understanding that light is reflected from surfaces, including mirrors and other reflective materials. In Year 3 this is observed; in Year 6 it is explained using the straight-line travel model.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Knowing that shiny surfaces like mirrors reflect light, demonstrated by seeing a torch beam bounce off a mirror. | Thinking the mirror makes its own light; Not noticing that the light changes direction |
| **Developing** | Understanding that light reflects off surfaces and that smooth, shiny surfaces reflect light best. We see most objects because light bounces off them into our eyes. | Thinking only mirrors reflect light; Not understanding that we see all objects by reflected light |
| **Expected** | Investigating reflection, identifying reflective and non-reflective surfaces, and understanding that the angle of reflection equals the angle at which light hits the surface. | Thinking reflected light always goes in the same direction regardless of the incoming angle; Not connecting the practical observation to the rule about equal angles |
| **Greater Depth** | Applying reflection principles to explain everyday phenomena and design solutions using mirrors. | Not explaining why the mirrors must be at 45°; Drawing the light path incorrectly through the periscope |

### Secondary concept: Shadow Formation (SC-KS2-C024)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Understanding that shadows are formed when light from a source is blocked by an opaque object. In Year 3, the pattern of shadow size changes is explored. In Year 6, shadow shape is explained using the straight-line travel model.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Knowing that shadows form when something blocks the light, and that shadows are dark areas. | Thinking shadows have colour or are reflections; Not connecting the shadow to the light being blocked |
| **Developing** | Explaining that shadows form when opaque objects block light, and that transparent and translucent materials create different effects. | Thinking transparent objects also create dark shadows; Confusing translucent with transparent |
| **Expected** | Investigating how shadow size changes with the position of the light source or object, and explaining the results using the idea that light travels in straight lines. | Thinking the shadow changes shape as well as size; Not explaining the result using the straight-line travel of light |
| **Greater Depth** | Using the straight-line model of light to explain shadow formation with ray diagrams, and applying this to real-world phenomena like sundials and eclipses. | Drawing ray diagrams without showing the angle of light correctly; Not connecting shadow length to the Sun's angle in the sky |

### Secondary concept: Light Travels in Straight Lines (SC-KS2-C067)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

The explanatory model that light travels in straight lines from sources. This model explains why we see objects (light reaches our eyes directly from sources or via reflection), why shadows have the same shape as the object casting them, and how optical instruments work.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Knowing that light comes from light sources and travels to our eyes, allowing us to see things. | Thinking light can bend around solid objects; Not connecting the blocked light to the shadow |
| **Developing** | Understanding that light travels in straight lines and this explains why shadows have the same shape as the object blocking the light. | Not understanding that the experiment proves light travels in straight lines; Thinking light might bend a little around the card |
| **Expected** | Using the straight-line model of light to explain how we see objects (light reflects off them into our eyes), how shadows form, and drawing ray diagrams. | Drawing light going from the eye to the object (emission theory — incorrect); Not including the reflection step — light must bounce off the object into the eye |
| **Greater Depth** | Applying the straight-line model to explain complex phenomena like why shadows become larger/smaller and how mirrors redirect light. | Not drawing accurate straight-line rays that show the geometry; Explaining the size change without reference to the straight-line model |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Fair testing and investigations are designed to isolate variables and establish causal relationships — the cognitive demand is reasoning from controlled evidence to causal claims.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- What caused this to happen?
- How could we check if that is the reason?
- Is there more than one reason?
- What would happen if we changed just one thing?

**Secondary lens:** Patterns — Data from repeated investigations reveals patterns that allow pupils to generalise their findings beyond the specific test conditions.

---

## Session structure: Fair Test

### Fair Test
The classic scientific enquiry: formulating a testable question, making a prediction based on scientific understanding, designing a method that controls variables, collecting and recording data systematically, analysing results, and drawing a conclusion linked back to the original hypothesis.

`question` → `hypothesis` → `method` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `conclusion`

**Assessment:** Structured scientific report including question, hypothesis with reasoning, method with variables identified, results table/graph, and conclusion evaluating whether results support the hypothesis.

**Teacher note:** Use the FAIR TEST template: frame a testable question and guide pupils to identify the variable they will change, measure, and keep the same. Support them in making a prediction with a scientific reason. Collect measurements using appropriate equipment and record results in a table. Guide pupils to describe patterns in their results and say whether their prediction was supported.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What is our testable question?
- What will you change, measure, and keep the same?
- What pattern can you see in your results?
- Does the evidence support your prediction? How do you know?

---

## Variables

**Independent:** distance between light source and object
**Dependent:** size of shadow (cm height)
**Controlled:** same light source, same object, same screen distance, darkened room

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- torches
- opaque objects
- white screen/card
- mirrors
- ruler
- metre stick

**Safety notes:** Do not shine torches directly into eyes. Supervise mirror use — reflected light can dazzle. Darken the room for best results but ensure safe movement. (Hazard level: low)

---

## Expected outcome

Shadows form when opaque objects block light. Shadow size increases as the object moves closer to the light source. Light travels in straight lines. We see objects because light reflects off them into our eyes.

**Recording format:** results table, line graph, ray diagram showing light travel

---

## Enquiry type

### Fair Test
A controlled investigation where one variable is deliberately changed while all others are kept the same, to determine whether the changed variable has an effect on a measured outcome. The gold-standard enquiry type for causal questions in science.

**KS2 guidance:** At KS2, fair tests should involve tangible, observable variables. Pupils identify what they will change, measure, and keep the same. Predictions use 'I think... because...' stems. Data is recorded in tables and presented as bar charts or line graphs. Conclusions state whether the prediction was supported and give a simple causal explanation.

**Question stems:**
- How does [independent variable] affect [dependent variable]?
- Does changing [variable] make a difference to [outcome]?
- What is the relationship between [variable A] and [variable B]?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What will you change? (independent variable)
- What will you measure or observe? (dependent variable)
- What will you keep the same? (controlled variables)
- What do you predict will happen? Why?
- Was your prediction correct? What does the evidence show?

## Known misconceptions

### Eyes emit light
**What pupils may say:** Our eyes send out light beams to see things.
**Correct explanation:** We see objects because light from a source (the sun, a lamp, etc.) reflects off objects and enters our eyes. Our eyes are detectors, not emitters. The ancient Greek 'emission theory' of vision has been disproved — nothing comes out of our eyes. In a completely dark room, we cannot see anything because there is no light to reflect.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- If our eyes sent out light, would we be able to see in a completely dark room?
- Draw an arrow diagram showing how you see a book on a table.
- What is the role of light in how we see things?

### Shadows have colour
**What pupils may say:** Shadows have colour — a red object makes a red shadow.
**Correct explanation:** A shadow is an area where light has been blocked by an opaque object. Shadows are dark (absence of light), not coloured. The colour of the object does not affect the colour of its shadow. The shadow takes the shape of the object because light travels in straight lines.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- What colour is the shadow of a red ball? Why?
- What actually IS a shadow?
- Can you make a coloured shadow? (Only with coloured lights, not coloured objects.)


---

## Why this study matters

Fair testing the relationship between distance and shadow size produces a clear, quantitative pattern that pupils can graph and explain using the model of light travelling in straight lines. The investigation bridges practical measurement skills with the abstract idea of ray diagrams, building towards the Y6 requirement to explain how we see objects.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils think their eyes send out light to see objects — reinforce that we see because light reflects off objects into our eyes
2. Difficulty understanding that the shadow is not 'attached' to the object — use a torch and move both object and screen
3. Assuming coloured filters make coloured shadows — the shadow is where light is blocked, not where colour appears

---

## Working scientifically skills (KS2)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Asking questions** — Posing simple questions about observations and recognising that different types of question require different approaches to find an answer, including tests, observations over time, and looking in books.
- **Observing closely** — Using the senses and simple equipment such as magnifying glasses to make careful first-hand observations of objects, organisms and phenomena.
- **Performing simple tests** — Carrying out simple practical investigations to explore questions, with early awareness that some things should be kept the same while one thing is changed.
- **Identifying and classifying** — Sorting and grouping objects, organisms or materials according to their observable characteristics, recognising that things can be classified in more than one way depending on which features are selected.
- **Using observations to suggest answers** — Making connections between what has been observed and possible answers to questions, explaining reasoning in accessible language and recognising when observations support or challenge initial ideas.
- **Gathering and recording data** — Collecting information from observations or tests and presenting it in simple forms including drawings, labelled diagrams, tables and pictograms to support answering a scientific question.
