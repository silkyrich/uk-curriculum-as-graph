## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Three States of Matter (SC-KS2-C034)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Understanding that materials can be classified as solids, liquids or gases based on their observable properties. Solids hold their shape; liquids form a pool but not a pile; gases escape from unsealed containers and are not visible.

**Teaching guidance:** Sort a collection of materials into solids, liquids and gases based on observable properties. Investigate borderline cases — is sand a solid or a liquid? (Solid, because each grain is solid even though sand pours.) Is toothpaste a solid or a liquid? Introduce the particle model informally: in solids, particles are closely packed and vibrate in fixed positions; in liquids, particles are close but can move around each other; in gases, particles are far apart and move freely. Use physical modelling (pupils acting as particles) to represent each state. Explore gases by trapping air in syringes and balloons.

**Key vocabulary:** solid, liquid, gas, state of matter, property, shape, volume, flow, pour, compress, particle, fixed, vibrate, container, material, classify

**Common misconceptions:** Children commonly think that powders (flour, sand, sugar) are liquids because they pour. They are collections of tiny solids. Some pupils think gases have no mass or do not exist because they are invisible — weighing a balloon before and after inflation can address this. Children may struggle with the concept that the same substance (e.g., water) can exist as a solid, liquid or gas depending on temperature.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Naming the three states of matter — solid, liquid and gas — and giving a familiar example of each. | Name the three states of matter. Give one example of each. | Not knowing the term 'states of matter'; Thinking steam (visible mist) is the gas — actually water vapour (invisible) is the gas |
| **Developing** | Describing the observable properties that define each state: solids hold their shape, liquids take the shape of their container but have a fixed volume, gases fill any container and are often invisible. | How can you tell if something is a solid, liquid or gas? Describe the properties of each. | Thinking powders (flour, sand) are liquids because they pour; Thinking gases do not exist because they are invisible |
| **Expected** | Classifying a range of materials into solids, liquids and gases, handling tricky cases (sand, jelly, foam), and beginning to explain states using the particle model. | Is sand a solid or a liquid? It pours like a liquid. Is toothpaste a solid or a liquid? Explain your reasoning. | Classifying sand as a liquid because it pours; Not using the particle model to explain their reasoning |
| **Greater Depth** | Using the particle model to explain why each state has its characteristic properties and predicting behaviour in new situations. | Using the particle model, explain why you can walk through air (a gas) but not through a wall (a solid). Why can you push your hand through water (a liquid)? | Describing particles as changing size between states (they change spacing, not size); Not connecting particle arrangement to observable properties |

> **Model response (Entry):** *Solid: ice. Liquid: water. Gas: steam.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Solids: keep their own shape, can be held, do not flow. Liquids: flow and take the shape of their container, have a flat surface, can be poured. Gases: spread out to fill any space, often invisible, can be compressed (squashed into a smaller space).*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Sand is a solid — each grain of sand is a tiny solid that keeps its shape. Sand pours because the grains are small and loose, but the material itself is solid. If you look at one grain under a magnifying glass, it does not flow or take the shape of a container. Toothpaste is trickier — it behaves like a solid when still (it holds its shape on the brush) but flows like a thick liquid when squeezed. It is actually a mixture that has properties of both states. Using the particle model: in solids, particles are tightly packed and vibrate in fixed positions. In liquids, particles are close but can slide past each other. In gases, particles are spread far apart and move freely.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *In air (gas), particles are spread far apart with large gaps between them. Your body can push through because the particles move aside easily — they have lots of space and energy to move. In a solid wall, particles are tightly packed in a fixed arrangement with strong forces holding them together. You cannot push through because there are no gaps and the particles cannot be displaced. In water (liquid), particles are close together but can slide over each other — your hand pushes particles aside and they flow around it, then close up behind. This is why liquids flow and take the shape of their container — the particles are not fixed in position like solids, but are closer together than in a gas. The particle model explains all three states with one simple idea: how close the particles are and how much they can move.*

### Secondary concept: Changes of State (SC-KS2-C035)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Understanding that materials change state when heated or cooled: melting (solid to liquid), freezing (liquid to solid), evaporation/boiling (liquid to gas), condensation (gas to liquid). Temperature at which state changes occur can be measured in degrees Celsius.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Knowing that ice turns into water when it gets warm and water turns into ice when it gets cold. | Not using the word 'melts'; Thinking the ice disappears rather than becoming water |
| **Developing** | Naming the changes of state — melting, freezing, evaporating, condensing — and identifying that heating and cooling cause these changes. | Confusing evaporation with condensation; Not knowing the word 'condensation' |
| **Expected** | Explaining changes of state using the particle model, identifying the temperature at which state changes occur, and distinguishing evaporation from boiling. | Thinking evaporation only happens when it is hot; Confusing steam (visible mist of tiny water droplets) with water vapour (invisible gas) |
| **Greater Depth** | Applying understanding of changes of state to explain everyday phenomena and predict the effects of changing conditions. | Thinking the visible cloud is steam or smoke; Not identifying condensation as the process (gas to liquid) |

### Secondary concept: The Water Cycle (SC-KS2-C036)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Understanding that evaporation and condensation are key processes in the water cycle. Water evaporates from oceans, lakes and land when heated; water vapour condenses to form clouds; precipitation returns water to the surface. Rate of evaporation increases with temperature.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Knowing that rain falls from clouds, puddles dry up in the sun, and this happens over and over again. | Thinking the water disappears completely; Not knowing where the water goes |
| **Developing** | Describing the water cycle using the terms evaporation, condensation and precipitation in the correct sequence. | Not explaining that water vapour is invisible (clouds are already condensed droplets); Missing one of the three key processes |
| **Expected** | Explaining the water cycle with reference to temperature driving evaporation and cooling driving condensation, and investigating factors that affect evaporation rate. | Not explaining the mechanism — just saying 'heat makes it evaporate faster'; Not connecting the classroom investigation to the global water cycle |
| **Greater Depth** | Explaining the water cycle as a closed system where no water is created or destroyed, and applying this to environmental issues. | Thinking water can be used up or destroyed; Not explaining why a closed cycle can still lead to shortages |

## Thinking lens: Evidence and Argument (primary)

**Key question:** What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?

**Why this lens fits:** This cluster asks pupils to gather, record or communicate scientific findings — the core cognitive demand is evaluating what counts as valid evidence and how to present it clearly.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- What evidence supports this claim?
- Is this a fact or an opinion? How can you tell?
- Is this strong evidence or weak evidence? Why?
- Can you structure your argument: claim, evidence, reasoning?

**Secondary lens:** Structure and Function — Material properties link physical structure (molecular arrangement, surface texture) to functional behaviour (waterproofing, strength, flexibility) — the key question is always 'why does this material behave this way?'

---

## Session structure: Observation Over Time

### Observation Over Time
Systematic observation and recording of changes or patterns over an extended period. Pupils make careful observations, record findings using drawings, measurements, or logs, classify what they observe, and identify patterns or trends. Particularly suited to biological processes and artistic study of the natural world.

`observation` → `recording` → `classifying` → `pattern_identification`

**Assessment:** Observation log or journal with dated entries, annotated drawings or measurements, classification of observations, and summary identifying the key patterns or changes observed.

**Teacher note:** Use the OBSERVATION OVER TIME template: set up a systematic observation that pupils record at regular intervals. Introduce simple recording techniques such as labelled diagrams, data tables, or photographs. Guide pupils to compare observations across time points, describe changes using scientific vocabulary, and identify any patterns in what they observe.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What will you observe, and how often will you record it?
- How has it changed since the last observation?
- Can you spot a pattern in how it has changed over time?
- What do you think caused the changes you observed?

---

## Variables

**Independent:** location of water sample (sunny windowsill, shaded shelf, cupboard)
**Dependent:** water level after 1 week (ml)
**Controlled:** same volume of water, same container size

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- ice cubes
- kettle (teacher demonstration)
- thermometer
- containers for evaporation test
- measuring cylinder

**Safety notes:** Teacher demonstrates boiling water — pupils do not handle hot water or kettles. Thermometers should be non-mercury. Supervise any activity involving hot liquids. Ensure pupils stand back during steam demonstrations. (Hazard level: standard)

---

## Expected outcome

Solids have fixed shape, liquids take container shape, gases fill available space. Heating causes melting/evaporation, cooling causes condensation/freezing. The water cycle is a continuous process of evaporation, condensation, and precipitation.

**Recording format:** particle diagrams for each state, evaporation results table, water cycle diagram with labels

---

## Enquiry type

### Observation Over Time
A systematic enquiry where changes are observed and recorded at intervals over a period of time — hours, days, weeks, or longer. Used when the process being studied is too slow for a single lesson or when the pattern only emerges through repeated observation. Develops patience, systematic recording, and the ability to identify trends.

**KS2 guidance:** At KS2, observations over time typically span 1-3 weeks (plant growth, evaporation, decay). Pupils should set up a clear recording schedule and use drawings, measurements, or photographs consistently. Patterns are described in words and shown on simple line graphs. Explanations link observations to scientific concepts at an age-appropriate level.

**Question stems:**
- How does [thing being observed] change over time?
- What happens to [variable] over [time period]?
- What pattern can you see in how [process] changes?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What do you think will happen over time? Why?
- How often should we observe and record?
- What exactly will we look for or measure each time?
- What pattern can you see in the observations?
- Can you explain why this pattern happens?

## Known misconceptions

### Water disappears in evaporation
**What pupils may say:** When water evaporates, it disappears — it is gone.
**Correct explanation:** When water evaporates, it changes from liquid water to water vapour (an invisible gas). The water has not disappeared — it has changed state and is now in the air. This is why the air can feel humid, and why water condenses on cold surfaces. The total amount of water is conserved.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- Where does the water in a puddle go when the puddle dries up?
- If water 'disappears' when it evaporates, where does the rain come from?
- Is water vapour the same as steam?

### Melting and dissolving confusion
**What pupils may say:** Melting and dissolving are the same thing.
**Correct explanation:** Melting is a change of state caused by heating — a solid becomes a liquid (e.g. ice melts to water). Dissolving is a substance mixing into a solvent to form a solution (e.g. sugar dissolves in water). Melting involves one substance and heat; dissolving involves two substances and no heat is necessarily required. A melted substance can be recovered by cooling; a dissolved substance can be recovered by evaporating the solvent.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- What is the difference between melting chocolate and dissolving sugar?
- Does sugar melt or dissolve when you put it in tea?
- How would you recover melted butter? How would you recover dissolved salt?

### Steam and water vapour are the same
**What pupils may say:** Steam and water vapour are the same thing.
**Correct explanation:** Water vapour is an invisible gas — you cannot see it. What we commonly call 'steam' (the white cloud from a kettle) is actually tiny droplets of liquid water that have condensed from water vapour when it meets cooler air. True steam (water vapour at 100C) is invisible. The visible 'steam' is a mist of condensed water droplets.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- Can you see water vapour? Why or why not?
- Look at a boiling kettle — where is the gap between the spout and the white cloud? What is in that gap?
- Is the white cloud from a kettle made of gas or tiny liquid droplets?

### Evaporation only at boiling
**What pupils may say:** Water only evaporates when it boils at 100 degrees.
**Correct explanation:** Evaporation happens at any temperature from the surface of a liquid. Even at room temperature, the fastest-moving particles at the surface have enough energy to escape into the air. Boiling is when evaporation happens throughout the liquid (not just the surface) and occurs at a specific temperature (100C for water at standard pressure). Puddles dry up without reaching boiling point because of surface evaporation.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- How does a puddle dry up on a cool day when the temperature is nowhere near 100C?
- What is the difference between evaporation and boiling?
- Where does evaporation happen — at the surface or throughout the liquid?

## Why this study matters

Observation over time is the ideal enquiry type for evaporation because the process is too slow for a single lesson but produces clear, measurable results over a week. Combining hands-on state change demonstrations with the longer evaporation investigation helps pupils connect everyday experiences (puddles drying, windows steaming) to the scientific model of particle behaviour.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils think the water 'disappears' during evaporation rather than understanding it becomes water vapour in the air
2. Confusing melting and dissolving — melting is a change of state caused by heating, dissolving is a substance mixing into a liquid
3. Difficulty classifying some materials (e.g. sand, jelly) — discuss that individual grains of sand are solid even though sand can be poured

## Working scientifically skills (KS2)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Asking questions** — Posing simple questions about observations and recognising that different types of question require different approaches to find an answer, including tests, observations over time, and looking in books.
- **Observing closely** — Using the senses and simple equipment such as magnifying glasses to make careful first-hand observations of objects, organisms and phenomena.
- **Performing simple tests** — Carrying out simple practical investigations to explore questions, with early awareness that some things should be kept the same while one thing is changed.
- **Identifying and classifying** — Sorting and grouping objects, organisms or materials according to their observable characteristics, recognising that things can be classified in more than one way depending on which features are selected.
- **Using observations to suggest answers** — Making connections between what has been observed and possible answers to questions, explaining reasoning in accessible language and recognising when observations support or challenge initial ideas.
- **Gathering and recording data** — Collecting information from observations or tests and presenting it in simple forms including drawings, labelled diagrams, tables and pictograms to support answering a scientific question.
