---

## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **3 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Vibration as the Cause of Sound (SC-KS2-C037)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Understanding that all sounds are made by vibrating objects. The vibration causes surrounding particles to vibrate, transmitting the sound as a wave through the medium (solid, liquid or gas) to the ear.

**Teaching guidance:** Explore sound production through hands-on activities: pluck a guitar string and watch it vibrate, strike a tuning fork and touch it to water to see splashing, tap a drum with rice grains on top to see them bounce, and hold a ruler over the edge of a desk and twang it. Use the common thread to establish the principle that all sounds come from something vibrating. Place a hand on the throat while humming to feel vocal cord vibration. Discuss how to stop a sound — stop the vibration (damping). Use the term 'vibration' consistently and ask pupils to identify what is vibrating in each example.

**Key vocabulary:** sound, vibration, vibrate, source, wave, ear, hear, loud, quiet, pitch, tuning fork, instrument, drum, string, vocal cords, energy

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think sounds just 'happen' without anything vibrating, or that only musical instruments vibrate. They may not connect everyday sounds (speech, traffic, wind) to vibration. Some pupils think that when they hear a sound, the vibrating object has sent something physical to their ear rather than understanding that vibrations pass through the air as a wave.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Knowing that sounds are made when objects vibrate, demonstrated by feeling or seeing vibrations. | Pluck this elastic band stretched over a box. What can you see and hear? | Not connecting the visible vibration to the sound they hear; Thinking the sound comes from the box, not the vibrating band |
| **Developing** | Explaining that all sounds are caused by vibrations and giving multiple examples where vibration produces sound. | Give three examples of objects vibrating to produce sound. | Not being able to identify the vibrating part of an instrument (e.g. in a drum, it is the skin); Thinking sound can be made without anything vibrating |
| **Expected** | Explaining that vibrating objects cause surrounding air particles to vibrate, transmitting sound as a wave to the ear, and demonstrating this with practical examples. | Strike a tuning fork and touch it to the surface of water. What happens? Explain how the sound reaches your ear. | Thinking air particles physically travel from the source to the ear; Not explaining the step from vibrating object to vibrating air to vibrating eardrum |
| **Greater Depth** | Using the vibration model to explain why sound cannot travel through a vacuum and predicting how changes to the vibrating object affect the sound. | Astronauts in space cannot hear each other without radios, even if they shout. Explain why, using your understanding of how sound travels. | Thinking sound is blocked by space rather than understanding it needs particles; Not distinguishing between sound waves (need particles) and radio waves (do not) |

> **Model response (Entry):** *I can hear a sound. I can see the elastic band moving back and forth really fast — vibrating.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *A guitar string vibrates when plucked and produces a musical note. A drum skin vibrates when hit and makes a boom sound. Our vocal cords vibrate when we speak — I can feel this by touching my throat while talking.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *The tuning fork vibrates and when I touch it to the water, it makes the water splash — showing that the vibrations transfer energy to the water. The sound reaches my ear because the vibrating tuning fork pushes the air particles next to it back and forth. These particles push the next ones, and so on, creating a wave that travels through the air. When the wave reaches my ear, it makes my eardrum vibrate, and I hear the sound. The tuning fork → air particles → ear. The particles do not travel from the fork to my ear — they pass the vibration along like a Mexican wave.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *Sound is a vibration that travels through a medium — solid, liquid or gas — by particles passing the vibration to neighbouring particles. In space, there is a vacuum — no air or other material, so there are no particles to vibrate. Without particles to carry the wave, the vibration cannot travel from one astronaut's mouth to another's ear. This proves that sound is not a 'thing' that floats through space — it is a wave that needs a medium to travel through. Astronauts use radios because radio waves are electromagnetic waves, not mechanical waves like sound. Electromagnetic waves can travel through a vacuum because they do not need particles. In science fiction films, explosions in space are shown with loud bangs — in reality, space is completely silent.*

### Secondary concept: Sound Transmission Through Media (SC-KS2-C038)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Understanding that vibrations from sounds travel through a medium (solid, liquid or gas) to the ear. Sound cannot travel through a vacuum. Sound travels through different media at different speeds.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Knowing that you can hear sounds through air and that sound can travel through solid objects too. | Not realising sound can travel through solids; Thinking sound only travels through air |
| **Developing** | Understanding that sound can travel through solids, liquids and gases, and that it cannot travel through a vacuum (empty space). | Thinking sound can travel through a vacuum (influenced by films); Not including liquids as a medium for sound |
| **Expected** | Explaining that sound travels through different media at different speeds (fastest through solids, slowest through gases) using the particle model. | Thinking sound travels fastest through gases because air is 'easier to move through'; Not connecting particle spacing to speed of sound transmission |
| **Greater Depth** | Applying understanding of sound transmission to explain practical phenomena and engineering solutions. | Not explaining why tension affects sound transmission; Thinking the sound travels through the air inside the string (it travels through the string itself) |

### Secondary concept: Pitch and Sound Source Features (SC-KS2-C039)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Understanding that the pitch of a sound is related to features of the object producing it. Longer, larger or looser objects produce lower pitch sounds. Shorter, smaller or tighter objects produce higher pitch sounds. Patterns can be found and investigated.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recognising that sounds can be high or low (pitch), and connecting pitch to the size or length of the sound source. | Confusing pitch (high/low) with volume (loud/quiet); Not noticing the difference between the two sounds |
| **Developing** | Understanding that shorter, smaller or tighter objects produce higher-pitched sounds and longer, larger or looser objects produce lower-pitched sounds. | Confusing pitch with volume — pressing harder makes it louder, not higher; Thinking only one factor (length) affects pitch |
| **Expected** | Investigating the relationship between pitch and the features of the vibrating object, identifying patterns and explaining results. | Thinking the water produces the sound (it is the air column that vibrates); Confusing more water with lower pitch (more water = shorter air column = higher pitch) |
| **Greater Depth** | Applying pitch concepts to explain how musical instruments work and predicting the pitch of untested objects. | Not controlling other variables (material, thickness) in the instrument design; Not connecting the instrument design to the scientific principle |

### Secondary concept: Volume and Vibration Strength (SC-KS2-C040)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Understanding that the volume (loudness) of a sound is related to the strength (amplitude) of the vibrations producing it. Stronger vibrations produce louder sounds. Sound becomes fainter as distance from the source increases.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Knowing that hitting something harder makes a louder sound. | Confusing volume change with pitch change; Not recognising that both hits produced the same note (pitch) at different volumes |
| **Developing** | Understanding that louder sounds are caused by bigger (stronger) vibrations and connecting volume to the strength of the vibration. | Thinking louder means the sound travels faster (it does not — it has more energy); Not linking the strength of the hit to the size of the vibration |
| **Expected** | Explaining the relationship between vibration strength (amplitude) and volume, and investigating how volume decreases with distance from the source. | Thinking the sound slows down rather than spreads out; Not explaining why spreading out reduces loudness |
| **Greater Depth** | Distinguishing clearly between pitch and volume as independent properties of sound, and applying this understanding to solve problems. | Thinking loud automatically means high-pitched; Not giving examples of all four combinations (loud-high, loud-low, quiet-high, quiet-low) |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Fair testing and investigations are designed to isolate variables and establish causal relationships — the cognitive demand is reasoning from controlled evidence to causal claims.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- What caused this to happen?
- How could we check if that is the reason?
- Is there more than one reason?
- What would happen if we changed just one thing?

**Secondary lens:** Patterns — Data from repeated investigations reveals patterns that allow pupils to generalise their findings beyond the specific test conditions.

---

## Session structure: Pattern Seeking

### Pattern Seeking
Enquiry focused on identifying relationships and regularities in data. Pupils pose questions about possible correlations, gather data through observation or measurement, organise and represent data graphically, identify patterns, and attempt to explain the underlying relationship.

`question` → `data_gathering` → `graphing` → `pattern_identification` → `explanation`

**Assessment:** Data presentation with appropriate graph or chart, written description of the pattern found, and explanation of the possible reasons for the pattern, including evaluation of the strength of evidence.

**Teacher note:** Use the PATTERN SEEKING template: pose a question that pupils investigate by collecting data and looking for relationships. Guide them to gather data systematically, present it in tables or graphs, and describe any patterns they find. Encourage them to suggest explanations for the patterns and consider whether the pattern always holds true.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What data do we need to collect to answer this question?
- What does the graph or table show? Can you describe the pattern?
- Does this pattern always happen, or are there exceptions?
- What might explain the pattern you have found?

---

## Variables

**Independent:** length of vibrating object (ruler overhang, elastic band tension)
**Dependent:** pitch of sound produced
**Controlled:** same material, same striking force

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- tuning forks
- water tray
- rulers
- elastic bands
- shoe boxes (string telephones)
- rice on drum skin

**Safety notes:** Keep volume levels reasonable to protect hearing. Tuning forks can be sharp at the prongs — demonstrate correct use before pupils handle them. Do not strike tuning forks on hard surfaces as they may chip. (Hazard level: low)

---

## Expected outcome

Sounds are caused by vibrations. Higher pitch = faster vibrations (shorter/tighter object). Louder sound = bigger vibrations. Sound travels through solids, liquids, and gases but not through a vacuum.

**Recording format:** observations table, pattern statement, diagram of vibration

---

## Enquiry type

### Pattern Seeking
An enquiry where pupils look for relationships or correlations between variables in situations where it is not possible or appropriate to control all the variables. Data is collected and analysed to determine whether there is a pattern — 'Is there a link between X and Y?' — without necessarily establishing causation.

**KS2 guidance:** At KS2, pattern seeking involves gathering observations across multiple examples and looking for trends. Pupils may rank, sort, or graph data to reveal patterns. Explanations describe the pattern and offer a possible reason. Examples: pitch and length of vibrating object, reactivity of metals, shadow size and distance.

**Question stems:**
- Is there a pattern between [variable A] and [variable B]?
- Do [things with property X] also tend to [show property Y]?
- Can you put these in order of [property] and see what pattern emerges?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- Is there a pattern between [variable A] and [variable B]?
- What do you notice when you compare [these examples]?
- Can you put these in order? What pattern emerges?
- Why might this pattern exist?
- Does the pattern always hold, or are there exceptions?

## Known misconceptions

### Sound travels through vacuum
**What pupils may say:** Sound can travel through space (a vacuum).
**Correct explanation:** Sound is a vibration that needs a medium (solid, liquid, or gas) to travel through. In a vacuum, there are no particles to vibrate, so sound cannot travel. This is why space is silent. Light can travel through a vacuum, but sound cannot — they are fundamentally different types of wave.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- Can astronauts hear each other talking in space without radios? Why not?
- What does sound need in order to travel from one place to another?
- What is the difference between how light and sound travel?

### Louder sounds travel faster
**What pupils may say:** Louder sounds travel faster than quieter sounds.
**Correct explanation:** The speed of sound depends on the medium it travels through (faster in solids than liquids, faster in liquids than gases), not on the volume. A whisper and a shout both travel at the same speed through air (approximately 343 m/s). Volume (amplitude) and speed are independent properties of sound.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- If someone shouts at you from across a field, does the sound arrive faster than if they whispered?
- What determines how fast sound travels?
- Does a loud sound have more energy than a quiet sound? Does it travel faster?

### Pitch and volume confusion
**What pupils may say:** Pitch and volume are the same thing — a high sound is a loud sound.
**Correct explanation:** Pitch and volume are independent properties of sound. Pitch is determined by the frequency of vibration (how fast the vibrations are). Volume is determined by the amplitude of vibration (how big the vibrations are). You can have a high quiet sound (a whispered squeak) or a low loud sound (a bass drum).
**Diagnostic questions:**
- Can you make a high sound that is quiet? Can you make a low sound that is loud?
- What determines the pitch of a sound? What determines the volume?
- A guitar string is plucked gently (quiet) and then hard (loud). Does the pitch change?

## Why this study matters

Pattern seeking develops pupils' ability to identify relationships in data without controlling all variables — an essential skill for real-world science. Sound provides an engaging, multi-sensory context where pupils can see, feel, and hear the evidence for vibrations, making abstract concepts about waves tangible.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils confuse pitch and volume — use clear examples to distinguish (e.g. whispering a high note vs shouting a low note)
2. Pupils think sound only travels through air — demonstrate sound travelling through solids using string telephones or pressing an ear to a desk
3. Difficulty seeing that 'vibration' is the cause of all sound — use rice on a drum skin and tuning forks in water to make vibrations visible

## Sensitive content

- Be aware of pupils with hearing impairments — adapt activities to include visual and tactile ways to experience vibration

## Working scientifically skills (KS2)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Asking questions** — Posing simple questions about observations and recognising that different types of question require different approaches to find an answer, including tests, observations over time, and looking in books.
- **Observing closely** — Using the senses and simple equipment such as magnifying glasses to make careful first-hand observations of objects, organisms and phenomena.
- **Performing simple tests** — Carrying out simple practical investigations to explore questions, with early awareness that some things should be kept the same while one thing is changed.
- **Identifying and classifying** — Sorting and grouping objects, organisms or materials according to their observable characteristics, recognising that things can be classified in more than one way depending on which features are selected.
- **Using observations to suggest answers** — Making connections between what has been observed and possible answers to questions, explaining reasoning in accessible language and recognising when observations support or challenge initial ideas.
- **Gathering and recording data** — Collecting information from observations or tests and presenting it in simple forms including drawings, labelled diagrams, tables and pictograms to support answering a scientific question.
