---

## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Rock Classification (SC-KS2-C019)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Understanding that rocks can be grouped and compared based on appearance and physical properties such as grain size, crystal structure, hardness, porosity, and whether they contain fossils. Examples: igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic (informal introduction).

**Teaching guidance:** Provide a collection of rock samples for hands-on investigation. Test rocks for hardness (scratch test), permeability (water drop test), appearance (crystal/grain examination with hand lens), and reaction to acid (vinegar test for limestone). Use the tests to group rocks rather than simply memorising names. Introduce the three rock types informally: rocks formed from cooled magma (igneous, e.g., granite, basalt), rocks formed from compressed layers (sedimentary, e.g., sandstone, chalk, limestone), and rocks changed by heat and pressure (metamorphic, e.g., marble, slate). Link to local geology where possible.

**Key vocabulary:** rock, mineral, grain, crystal, hard, soft, permeable, sedimentary, igneous, metamorphic, limestone, sandstone, granite, chalk, slate, marble, fossil, appearance, property

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think all rocks are hard and heavy — pumice floats on water, chalk crumbles easily. Some pupils believe rocks are unchanging and permanent, not understanding that rocks are slowly broken down by weathering and reformed over geological time. Children may confuse rocks with minerals, or think that 'sedimentary' means the rock contains mud rather than understanding the process of layers being compressed.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Observing and describing the appearance of different rocks, noting visible features like colour, texture and grain size. | Look at these three rocks. Describe what each one looks like and feels like. | Using only colour to describe rocks; Not touching the rocks to assess texture |
| **Developing** | Testing rocks for simple properties — hardness (scratch test), permeability (water absorption), and appearance — and grouping them based on results. | Test each rock for hardness (can you scratch it with a nail?), permeability (does it absorb water?) and grain size (can you see individual grains?). Record your results. | Not testing systematically — skipping some tests for some rocks; Confusing grain size with overall rock size |
| **Expected** | Grouping rocks based on properties and beginning to understand that the three rock types (igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic) form in different ways. | Group these rocks by how they were formed: granite (cooled from melted rock underground), sandstone (layers of sand pressed together), marble (limestone changed by heat and pressure). What are the three rock types called? | Not linking each rock type to its formation process; Thinking all rocks with crystals are the same type |
| **Greater Depth** | Explaining how rock properties relate to formation processes, and using properties to identify an unknown rock's likely type. | I give you an unknown rock. It has visible layers, contains small shell fossils, and absorbs water when you drip on it. What type of rock is it likely to be? How do you know? | Identifying the rock based on only one property rather than using multiple lines of evidence; Thinking fossils can be found in all rock types |

> **Model response (Entry):** *Rock A is grey and smooth with sparkly bits. Rock B is brown and crumbly with tiny holes. Rock C is dark and shiny with no visible grains.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Granite: very hard (nail cannot scratch it), does not absorb much water, visible crystals of different colours. Sandstone: medium hardness (nail scratches it slightly), absorbs water, visible sand grains. Chalk: soft (nail scratches it easily), absorbs lots of water, no visible grains — smooth and powdery.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Granite is igneous — formed when melted rock (magma) cooled slowly underground, which is why it has large crystals you can see. Sandstone is sedimentary — formed when layers of sand were squashed and cemented together over millions of years, which is why you can see the grains and sometimes find fossils in it. Marble is metamorphic — formed when limestone was changed by intense heat and pressure, creating a hard, crystalline rock. The three types are igneous (from heat), sedimentary (from layers) and metamorphic (from change).*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *It is almost certainly sedimentary. The visible layers show it formed from material deposited in layers over time. The fossils prove it was once soft enough for organisms to be trapped in it — only sedimentary rocks typically contain fossils because igneous rocks form from hot molten material that would destroy organisms, and metamorphic rocks are changed by such intense heat and pressure that fossils are usually destroyed. Absorbing water means it is porous — sedimentary rocks often have gaps between their grains. Using multiple properties (layers, fossils, porosity) together gives a much more reliable identification than any single test alone.*

### Secondary concept: Fossil Formation (SC-KS2-C020)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Understanding in simple terms how fossils are formed when the remains or traces of living things are trapped within sedimentary rock over millions of years. Fossils provide evidence of past life on Earth.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Knowing that fossils are the remains of animals or plants from long ago that are found in rocks. | Thinking fossils are actual bones (they are usually mineralised replacements or impressions); Not knowing that fossils are very old — millions of years |
| **Developing** | Describing in simple terms how a fossil forms: an organism dies, is buried by sediment, and its remains are slowly replaced by minerals over millions of years. | Thinking the fossil is the original bone rather than a mineral replacement; Not understanding the immense timescale involved |
| **Expected** | Explaining the fossilisation process, why only some organisms fossilise (hard parts, rapid burial), and why fossils are found only in sedimentary rock. | Not explaining why soft parts rarely fossilise; Thinking fossils can form in any type of rock |
| **Greater Depth** | Explaining how fossils provide evidence about past environments and the history of life on Earth, linking to the concept of extinction. | Not considering that continents have moved over geological time; Thinking Earth's climate has always been the same as today |

### Secondary concept: Soil Composition (SC-KS2-C021)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Understanding that soils are made from rock particles (formed by weathering) and organic matter (decayed living material). Different soils have different properties depending on their rock and organic matter composition.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Knowing that soil is found on the ground and that plants grow in it. | Calling soil 'dirt' without recognising it has a specific composition; Thinking soil is just one substance rather than a mixture |
| **Developing** | Describing soil as a mixture of tiny rock pieces and decayed plant and animal material (organic matter). | Not knowing that soil contains broken-down rock; Thinking soil is a single substance rather than a mixture |
| **Expected** | Explaining that soil forms from weathered rock mixed with organic matter, and that different soils have different properties depending on their composition. | Not connecting the layers to different soil types; Thinking all soil is the same everywhere |
| **Greater Depth** | Explaining the rock cycle connection to soil formation and the role of living organisms in creating and maintaining healthy soil. | Describing only physical weathering without mentioning biological processes; Not recognising the essential role of decomposers in soil formation |

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** Sorting, classifying and identifying similarities directly trains pupils to recognise regularities and use them to predict or generalise.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- What pattern can you see?
- Does this always happen, or can you find an exception?
- What rule connects these examples?
- What would you predict for the next one? Why?

**Secondary lens:** Systems and System Models — Earth science topics involve large-scale systems (water cycle, solar system, rock cycle) where components interact in cycles — mapping the system helps pupils understand processes they cannot directly observe.

## Session structure: Identifying and Classifying

### Identifying and Classifying
A scientific enquiry focused on identifying specimens, materials, or phenomena and organising them into meaningful groups. Pupils make careful observations, develop grouping criteria, apply classification systems, and understand why classification is useful in science.

`observation` → `grouping` → `criteria_development` → `classification` → `application`

**Assessment:** Classification key, sorting diagram, or identification guide created by the pupil, with written explanation of the criteria used and justification for groupings.

**Teacher note:** Use the IDENTIFYING AND CLASSIFYING template: present a set of specimens or examples and guide pupils to observe closely and record features systematically. Introduce classification keys and help pupils develop their own criteria for grouping. Expect pupils to use scientific vocabulary to describe features and justify their classification decisions.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What features will you use to classify these?
- Can you create a key that someone else could follow?
- Why did you choose these criteria for grouping?
- Does everything fit neatly, or are there tricky cases? Why?

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- rock samples (granite, chalk, sandstone, slate, marble)
- hand lenses
- vinegar (acid test for chalk)
- scratch test tools
- fossil samples

**Safety notes:** Supervise scratch tests — tools can be sharp. Vinegar is a mild acid — avoid contact with eyes. Wash hands after handling rocks and soil samples. (Hazard level: low)

---

## Expected outcome

Pupils classify rocks by hardness, appearance, and reaction to acid. They understand that fossils form in sedimentary rock through a process of sedimentation and mineralisation. Soil contains rock fragments plus decayed organic material.

**Recording format:** classification table with observable properties, Venn diagram, labelled diagrams of fossil formation

---

## Enquiry type

### Identifying and Classifying
An enquiry where pupils observe, identify, and sort objects, organisms, or materials into groups based on their observable characteristics. Develops careful observation, the ability to select relevant criteria for grouping, and understanding of why classification systems are useful in science.

**KS2 guidance:** At KS2, classification uses observable properties (hardness, colour, texture, size, behaviour). Pupils should use branching keys and Venn diagrams. They should understand that the same items can be classified in different ways depending on the criteria chosen. Link classification to real scientific examples (rocks, plants, animals).

**Question stems:**
- How can we sort these [items] into groups?
- What properties can we use to classify [these things]?
- Can you make a key to identify [these specimens]?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What can you observe about these [objects/organisms/materials]?
- What properties could you use to sort them?
- How have you decided which group each one belongs to?
- Could you sort them a different way? What would change?
- Can you make a key that someone else could use to identify them?

## Known misconceptions

### All rocks are the same
**What pupils may say:** All rocks are the same — they are just hard lumps from the ground.
**Correct explanation:** Rocks differ significantly in hardness, grain size, permeability, colour, and formation process. There are three main types: igneous (formed from cooled magma), sedimentary (formed from compressed layers of sediment), and metamorphic (formed when existing rocks are changed by heat and pressure). Each type has different properties because of how it was formed.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- Can you describe three ways that granite and chalk are different?
- Why are some rocks harder than others?
- How are the three main types of rock formed?

### Fossils are just bones
**What pupils may say:** Fossils are dinosaur bones.
**Correct explanation:** Fossils can be the preserved remains or traces of any organism, not just dinosaurs. They include shells, teeth, plant imprints, footprints (trace fossils), and even preserved insects in amber. Most fossils are of marine organisms, not dinosaurs. Fossils form when organisms are buried in sediment and their remains are gradually replaced by minerals over millions of years.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- Can you name three different things that can become fossils?
- Could you find a fossil of a plant? What about a footprint?
- Are most fossils from dinosaurs?

### Rocks do not change
**What pupils may say:** Rocks do not change — they have always been the same and always will be.
**Correct explanation:** Rocks are slowly broken down by weathering (physical, chemical, and biological) and erosion. The fragments are transported and deposited as sediment, which can form new sedimentary rock. Rocks can also be changed by heat and pressure (metamorphism) or melted and reformed (igneous processes). The rock cycle means rocks are constantly being recycled over geological time.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- What happens to a cliff face over thousands of years?
- Can a sedimentary rock become a metamorphic rock? How?
- What is the rock cycle?

## Why this study matters

Identifying and classifying is an essential science enquiry type that develops observational skills and evidence-based reasoning. Rocks provide a tangible, hands-on context where pupils can handle real specimens, test properties, and connect classroom science to the real landscape around them.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils may assume all shiny rocks are the same type — encourage testing multiple properties before grouping
2. Fossil formation is often oversimplified to 'a dead animal turns into rock' — model the sedimentation and mineralisation process step by step
3. Pupils confuse 'soil' with 'dirt' and do not realise soil contains both rock fragments and decayed organic material

## Working scientifically skills (KS2)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Asking questions** — Posing simple questions about observations and recognising that different types of question require different approaches to find an answer, including tests, observations over time, and looking in books.
- **Observing closely** — Using the senses and simple equipment such as magnifying glasses to make careful first-hand observations of objects, organisms and phenomena.
- **Performing simple tests** — Carrying out simple practical investigations to explore questions, with early awareness that some things should be kept the same while one thing is changed.
- **Identifying and classifying** — Sorting and grouping objects, organisms or materials according to their observable characteristics, recognising that things can be classified in more than one way depending on which features are selected.
- **Using observations to suggest answers** — Making connections between what has been observed and possible answers to questions, explaining reasoning in accessible language and recognising when observations support or challenge initial ideas.
- **Gathering and recording data** — Collecting information from observations or tests and presenting it in simple forms including drawings, labelled diagrams, tables and pictograms to support answering a scientific question.
