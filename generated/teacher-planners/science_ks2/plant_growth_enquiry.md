## Enquiry questions

1. What do plants need to grow well, and how does light affect plant growth?

---

## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **0 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Plant Requirements for Life and Growth (SC-KS2-C012)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Understanding that plants need air, light, water, nutrients from soil, and room to grow. These requirements vary between plant species. Plants can make their own food (photosynthesis concept introduced without detailed mechanism).

**Teaching guidance:** Set up controlled investigations where plants are deprived of one requirement at a time — one group with no light, one with no water, one in a cold environment — while a control plant receives all requirements. Record observations over two to three weeks using a consistent observation schedule. Introduce the concept that plants make their own food using light (photosynthesis) without requiring the detailed mechanism. Compare plant nutrition with animal nutrition — plants make food, animals must eat. Discuss why different plants may need different amounts of light or water.

**Key vocabulary:** light, water, air, nutrients, soil, temperature, photosynthesis, food, grow, healthy, survive, requirements, conditions, minerals, carbon dioxide

**Common misconceptions:** The most persistent misconception is that plants get their food from the soil. Plants make their own food through photosynthesis — they absorb water and minerals from the soil but these are raw materials, not food. Some children think plants only need sunlight and water, forgetting that air (carbon dioxide) is also essential. Children may believe that fertiliser is plant food rather than a mineral supplement.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Naming what plants need to grow: water, light and warmth, from prior KS1 knowledge. | What three things does a plant need to grow? | Saying 'soil' without understanding that soil provides water and minerals, not food; Forgetting light |
| **Developing** | Listing the full set of plant requirements — air, light, water, nutrients from soil and room to grow — and explaining that plants make their own food. | Name five things plants need to survive. How do plants get their food? | Saying plants get their food from the soil (the most persistent misconception in plant biology); Forgetting that air (carbon dioxide) is essential |
| **Expected** | Describing the results of investigations into plant requirements, using evidence to explain why each requirement is necessary. | We grew four plants: one with everything, one without light, one without water, one without soil nutrients (grown in washed sand). Describe and explain the results. | Describing the results without explaining why each deficiency caused the specific symptoms; Confusing the effect of no light (yellow, tall) with no water (wilted, dry) |
| **Greater Depth** | Explaining how plants make their own food using light energy (photosynthesis concept, without chemical detail), and why this makes them fundamentally different from animals. | A pupil says 'Plants eat food from the soil just like we eat food from our plates.' Explain what is wrong with this comparison. Where does a plant's food actually come from? | Accepting the 'plants eat from the soil' misconception; Not explaining the difference between raw materials (water, minerals) and food (glucose) |

> **Model response (Entry):** *Water, light and a warm place.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Plants need air (carbon dioxide), light (from the Sun), water (from rain or watering), nutrients from the soil (minerals) and room to grow. Unlike animals, plants make their own food in their leaves using light — this is called photosynthesis.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *The plant with everything grew well — tall, green, healthy leaves. Without light, the plant grew tall but was yellow and weak because it could not photosynthesise to make food or the green pigment chlorophyll. Without water, the plant wilted and dried because water is needed for photosynthesis and to keep cells firm. Without nutrients, the plant grew but the leaves turned yellow at the edges because it lacked minerals like nitrogen for making chlorophyll. Each requirement plays a different role in keeping the plant healthy.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *This is a common misunderstanding. Plants do not eat food from the soil — they make their own food inside their leaves using photosynthesis. The plant takes in carbon dioxide from the air through its leaves and water from the soil through its roots. Using energy from sunlight, it converts these into glucose (sugar), which is its food. Soil provides water and dissolved minerals (like fertiliser), but these are raw materials, not food. Animals must eat other organisms for food, but plants are producers — they create food from simple substances using light energy. This is why food chains always start with a plant.*

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Fair testing and investigations are designed to isolate variables and establish causal relationships — the cognitive demand is reasoning from controlled evidence to causal claims.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- What caused this to happen?
- How could we check if that is the reason?
- Is there more than one reason?
- What would happen if we changed just one thing?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — This cluster asks pupils to gather, record or communicate scientific findings — the core cognitive demand is evaluating what counts as valid evidence and how to present it clearly.

---

## Session structure: Fair Test

### Fair Test
The classic scientific enquiry: formulating a testable question, making a prediction based on scientific understanding, designing a method that controls variables, collecting and recording data systematically, analysing results, and drawing a conclusion linked back to the original hypothesis.

`question` → `hypothesis` → `method` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `conclusion`

**Assessment:** Structured scientific report including question, hypothesis with reasoning, method with variables identified, results table/graph, and conclusion evaluating whether results support the hypothesis.

**Teacher note:** Use the FAIR TEST template: frame a testable question and guide pupils to identify the variable they will change, measure, and keep the same. Support them in making a prediction with a scientific reason. Collect measurements using appropriate equipment and record results in a table. Guide pupils to describe patterns in their results and say whether their prediction was supported.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What is our testable question?
- What will you change, measure, and keep the same?
- What pattern can you see in your results?
- Does the evidence support your prediction? How do you know?

---

## Variables

**Independent:** amount of light (dark cupboard, partial shade, full sunlight)
**Dependent:** plant height (cm) measured over 3 weeks
**Controlled:** same type of plant, same pot size, same soil, same amount of water

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- cress seeds or bean plants
- plant pots
- ruler
- watering can
- labels
- cupboard for dark condition

**Safety notes:** Wash hands after handling soil. Avoid allergenic plants — check for allergies before choosing plant species. No consumption of experimental plants. (Hazard level: low)

---

## Expected outcome

Plants in full sunlight grow tallest and healthiest (green, sturdy). Plants in the dark grow tall and spindly (etiolated) but pale. Plants need light for healthy growth because light provides the energy for photosynthesis.

**Recording format:** weekly measurement table, line graph, conclusion

---

## Enquiry type

### Fair Test
A controlled investigation where one variable is deliberately changed while all others are kept the same, to determine whether the changed variable has an effect on a measured outcome. The gold-standard enquiry type for causal questions in science.

**KS2 guidance:** At KS2, fair tests should involve tangible, observable variables. Pupils identify what they will change, measure, and keep the same. Predictions use 'I think... because...' stems. Data is recorded in tables and presented as bar charts or line graphs. Conclusions state whether the prediction was supported and give a simple causal explanation.

**Question stems:**
- How does [independent variable] affect [dependent variable]?
- Does changing [variable] make a difference to [outcome]?
- What is the relationship between [variable A] and [variable B]?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What will you change? (independent variable)
- What will you measure or observe? (dependent variable)
- What will you keep the same? (controlled variables)
- What do you predict will happen? Why?
- Was your prediction correct? What does the evidence show?

## Known misconceptions

### Food from soil
**What pupils may say:** Plants get their food from the soil.
**Correct explanation:** Plants make their own food (glucose) through photosynthesis, using light energy, carbon dioxide from the air, and water from the soil. The soil provides water and minerals, but not food. This is what makes plants producers rather than consumers.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- Where does a plant get its food from?
- If you put a plant in very good soil but no light, would it grow well? Why?
- What is the difference between what plants take from the soil and what they make for themselves?

### Plants only need water and sunlight
**What pupils may say:** Plants only need water and sunlight to grow.
**Correct explanation:** Plants need water, light, carbon dioxide (from the air), and minerals (from the soil) to grow healthily. Carbon dioxide is needed for photosynthesis to make glucose. Minerals like nitrates are needed to make proteins. Without any one of these, the plant will not grow normally.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- What would happen to a plant that had water and sunlight but no air?
- A plant in good soil with plenty of water and light is still not growing well. What might be missing?
- Can you name four things a plant needs to grow?

### Etiolated growth is healthy
**What pupils may say:** A tall plant is always a healthy plant.
**Correct explanation:** Plants grown in the dark may grow taller than those in the light, but they are pale, spindly, and weak. This is called etiolation — the plant is stretching to reach light. A healthy plant has strong stems, green leaves (containing chlorophyll), and normal proportions. Height alone does not indicate health.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- You have two plants — one is tall but pale and thin, the other is shorter but green and strong. Which is healthier? Why?
- Why might a plant in a dark cupboard grow taller than one on the windowsill?

## Why this study matters

Fair testing plant growth over several weeks develops pupils' ability to plan long-running investigations, take repeat measurements, and draw conclusions from real-world data that includes natural variation. The light variable is accessible and produces dramatic, visible results (etiolated vs healthy plants) that motivate scientific explanation.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils water plants inconsistently across conditions, undermining the fair test — establish a watering rota
2. Pupils expect results within days rather than weeks — set expectations and use a measurement schedule
3. Confusing the plant growing tall in the dark (etiolation) with healthy growth — discuss what 'healthy growth' means

## Working scientifically skills (KS2)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Asking questions** — Posing simple questions about observations and recognising that different types of question require different approaches to find an answer, including tests, observations over time, and looking in books.
- **Observing closely** — Using the senses and simple equipment such as magnifying glasses to make careful first-hand observations of objects, organisms and phenomena.
- **Performing simple tests** — Carrying out simple practical investigations to explore questions, with early awareness that some things should be kept the same while one thing is changed.
- **Identifying and classifying** — Sorting and grouping objects, organisms or materials according to their observable characteristics, recognising that things can be classified in more than one way depending on which features are selected.
- **Using observations to suggest answers** — Making connections between what has been observed and possible answers to questions, explaining reasoning in accessible language and recognising when observations support or challenge initial ideas.
- **Gathering and recording data** — Collecting information from observations or tests and presenting it in simple forms including drawings, labelled diagrams, tables and pictograms to support answering a scientific question.
