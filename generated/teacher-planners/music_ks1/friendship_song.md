## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Pitch (MU-KS1-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Pitch is the quality of sound determined by the frequency of vibration - whether a sound is high or low. In music, pitch determines melody and harmony. At KS1, pupils develop their ability to hear, match and produce different pitches through singing, playing tuned instruments and using their voices expressively. Understanding pitch is fundamental to singing in tune and to understanding how melody works.

**Teaching guidance:** Use hand signs (such as Kodaly hand signs) to show pitch direction. Sing songs with wide pitch ranges and step-wise melodic motion. Use tuned percussion (glockenspiels, xylophones) to play and explore pitch. Play pitch-matching games where pupils echo a sung note or phrase. Explore pitch through body movement - crouch low for low notes, reach high for high notes. Develop vocabulary for describing pitch: high, low, getting higher, getting lower.

**Key vocabulary:** high, low, pitch, melody, tune, note, higher, lower, rise, fall, match

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often confuse pitch (high/low) with volume (loud/quiet). Consistent and deliberate use of the correct terms, with accompanying physical gestures, helps establish the distinction. Some pupils may struggle to match pitch when singing; a non-judgmental approach and regular practice are important. Not all pupils sing in tune initially, and this should be treated as a skill to develop rather than a fixed ability.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recognising that sounds can be high or low and using the voice to produce high and low sounds. | Sing a high sound like a bird. Now sing a low sound like a bear. Can you hear the difference? | Confusing loud with high and quiet with low; Not being able to physically produce a high or low sound on command |
| **Developing** | Singing in tune with a group, matching pitch to a given note, and showing the direction of pitch (going up, going down, staying the same). | Listen to these three notes. Are they going up, going down or staying the same? Show with your hand. | Not being able to distinguish whether a pitch is going up or down; Singing loudly instead of matching the target pitch |
| **Expected** | Singing with accurate pitch in a group performance and playing simple pitched patterns on tuned instruments, controlling pitch deliberately. | Play the notes C, D, E on a glockenspiel. Now play them going back down: E, D, C. Can you play a simple tune using just these three notes? | Hitting the wrong bars because of unfamiliarity with the instrument layout; Playing too quickly to control which notes are sounding |

> **Model response (Entry):** *My bird sound is high up — eeee! My bear sound is low down — grrrr. The bird sound is squeaky and the bear sound is rumbly.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *The notes are going up — each one is higher than the last. I moved my hand upward to show the melody going up.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *I played C, D, E going up and E, D, C going back down. For my tune I played: C, C, D, E, D, C. It sounds like a little question and answer — up then down.*

### Secondary concept: Dynamics and Tempo (MU-KS1-C003)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Dynamics refer to the loudness or softness of music, and tempo refers to the speed at which music is performed. Both are expressive tools used by composers and performers to shape musical meaning and emotional effect. At KS1, pupils learn to recognise and use changes in dynamics and tempo as a means of making music more expressive and interesting.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recognising the difference between loud and quiet sounds and between fast and slow music. | Confusing loud with fast (a piece can be loud and slow, or quiet and fast); Using only 'loud' and 'quiet' without noticing tempo changes |
| **Developing** | Using changes in dynamics (getting louder/quieter) and tempo (getting faster/slower) expressively when performing. | Jumping suddenly from quiet to loud instead of gradually changing; Getting louder but forgetting to get quieter again |
| **Expected** | Using dynamics and tempo deliberately in performance and composition to create mood, atmosphere or storytelling effects. | Keeping the same dynamic level throughout instead of using contrast; Not connecting the musical changes to the narrative or mood |

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** Pulse, rhythm, pitch sequences and dynamic contours are all temporal or tonal patterns — KS1 performance is fundamentally about recognising, reproducing and internalising these musical patterns through the body.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What is the same about these?
- What is different?
- What comes next?
- Can you sort these into groups?

**Secondary lens:** Structure and Function — Tempo and dynamics are structural parameters whose manipulation changes the expressive function of a performance; even at KS1, varying these elements purposefully introduces the idea that musical structure shapes meaning.

## Session structure: Performance

### Performance
A sequence building towards a culminating performance in music, drama, or physical activity. Pupils study repertoire or material, develop technical skills through focused practice, rehearse with attention to expression and communication, perform to an audience (real or virtual), and evaluate their own and others' performances.

`repertoire_study` → `technique_development` → `rehearsal` → `performance` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Performance assessed against subject-specific criteria (musical accuracy, expression, dramatic impact, physical skill execution) plus reflective self-evaluation.

**Teacher note:** Use the PERFORMANCE template: let children listen to, watch, or experience an example performance that excites them. Help them practise simple techniques — singing, moving, playing — with lots of encouragement. Give them time to rehearse in small groups. Celebrate their performance and help them say what they enjoyed and what went well.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What did you notice about the performance?
- Can you show me how to do that?
- What did your group do well?
- What was your favourite part of performing?

## Music focus

**Genre:** Pop
**Composer/piece:**  — Friendship Song
**Musical elements:** pitch, dynamics, tempo, structure
**Instruments:** voice
**Notation level:** none
**Listening repertoire:** You've Got a Friend in Me - Randy Newman, Count on Me - Bruno Mars
**MMC reference:** MMC Year 1, Unit 6

---

## Why this study matters

An end-of-year performance piece that consolidates all the musical learning from Year 1. Singing about friendship is age-appropriate and connects to PSHE. The performance element (singing to parents/carers) motivates careful rehearsal and teaches the difference between rehearsal and performance. Confidence in singing is the single most important musical outcome of KS1.

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Performance anxiety -- build up gradually from small group to whole class
2. Rushing tempo when nervous -- practise with a steady accompaniment
3. Forgetting the words -- use actions as memory aids
