## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Pulse and Rhythm (MU-KS1-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Pulse is the steady beat underlying music, like a heartbeat. Rhythm is the pattern of long and short sounds that occurs over the pulse. Understanding the relationship between pulse and rhythm is foundational to all music making, as it enables performers to play in time with others and to understand how music is organised in time. At KS1, pupils develop awareness of pulse through physical movement and clapping, and begin to distinguish between pulse and rhythm.

**Teaching guidance:** Use physical movement - clapping, marching, stepping - to establish a strong sense of pulse. Clap back rhythmic patterns and develop call-and-response activities. Use percussion instruments to distinguish between keeping the beat and clapping the rhythm of words. Use body percussion activities to build rhythm vocabulary. Connect rhythm to words and syllables by clapping the rhythm of names and familiar phrases.

**Key vocabulary:** pulse, beat, rhythm, pattern, steady, tempo, fast, slow, long, short, regular

**Common misconceptions:** Many pupils confuse pulse (the steady beat) with rhythm (the pattern of notes). Consistent use of these distinct terms alongside practical activities that separate them helps clarify the difference. Some pupils may clap the pulse when asked to clap the rhythm of a song, or vice versa; physical practice and verbal reinforcement of the distinction is needed.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Feeling and moving to a steady pulse in music, clapping or tapping along with the beat. | Listen to this music. Clap along with the steady beat. | Clapping the rhythm of the words instead of the underlying steady pulse; Speeding up or slowing down rather than maintaining a consistent beat |
| **Developing** | Distinguishing between pulse (steady beat) and rhythm (pattern of long and short sounds), and performing simple rhythmic patterns over a pulse. | One person clap the steady beat. Another person clap the rhythm of the words 'Hot Cross Buns'. Can you hear the difference? | Confusing pulse and rhythm — thinking they are the same thing; Not being able to maintain a steady pulse while someone else plays a rhythm |
| **Expected** | Performing rhythmic patterns accurately, including patterns with rests, and explaining the relationship between pulse and rhythm. | Clap this rhythm pattern from the notation: ta ta ti-ti ta (rest). Repeat it four times, staying in time with the pulse. | Not leaving a clear silence during the rest; Speeding up during repetitions |

> **Model response (Entry):** *I clapped in time with the music, keeping a steady, even beat throughout the song.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *The pulse is steady: clap, clap, clap, clap. The rhythm follows the words: HOT CROSS BUNS — three sounds with a gap. The rhythm has longer and shorter sounds but the pulse stays the same underneath.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *I clapped two crotchets, two quavers, one crotchet, then a rest where I showed my hands apart. I repeated it four times without speeding up. The pulse stayed steady underneath and the rhythm pattern fitted over it like words over a heartbeat.*

### Secondary concept: Dynamics and Tempo (MU-KS1-C003)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Dynamics refer to the loudness or softness of music, and tempo refers to the speed at which music is performed. Both are expressive tools used by composers and performers to shape musical meaning and emotional effect. At KS1, pupils learn to recognise and use changes in dynamics and tempo as a means of making music more expressive and interesting.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recognising the difference between loud and quiet sounds and between fast and slow music. | Confusing loud with fast (a piece can be loud and slow, or quiet and fast); Using only 'loud' and 'quiet' without noticing tempo changes |
| **Developing** | Using changes in dynamics (getting louder/quieter) and tempo (getting faster/slower) expressively when performing. | Jumping suddenly from quiet to loud instead of gradually changing; Getting louder but forgetting to get quieter again |
| **Expected** | Using dynamics and tempo deliberately in performance and composition to create mood, atmosphere or storytelling effects. | Keeping the same dynamic level throughout instead of using contrast; Not connecting the musical changes to the narrative or mood |

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** Pulse, rhythm, pitch sequences and dynamic contours are all temporal or tonal patterns — KS1 performance is fundamentally about recognising, reproducing and internalising these musical patterns through the body.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What is the same about these?
- What is different?
- What comes next?
- Can you sort these into groups?

**Secondary lens:** Structure and Function — Tempo and dynamics are structural parameters whose manipulation changes the expressive function of a performance; even at KS1, varying these elements purposefully introduces the idea that musical structure shapes meaning.

---

## Session structure: Performance

### Performance
A sequence building towards a culminating performance in music, drama, or physical activity. Pupils study repertoire or material, develop technical skills through focused practice, rehearse with attention to expression and communication, perform to an audience (real or virtual), and evaluate their own and others' performances.

`repertoire_study` → `technique_development` → `rehearsal` → `performance` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Performance assessed against subject-specific criteria (musical accuracy, expression, dramatic impact, physical skill execution) plus reflective self-evaluation.

**Teacher note:** Use the PERFORMANCE template: let children listen to, watch, or experience an example performance that excites them. Help them practise simple techniques — singing, moving, playing — with lots of encouragement. Give them time to rehearse in small groups. Celebrate their performance and help them say what they enjoyed and what went well.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What did you notice about the performance?
- Can you show me how to do that?
- What did your group do well?
- What was your favourite part of performing?

## Music focus

**Genre:** Hip Hop
**Composer/piece:**  — Hey You!
**Musical elements:** pulse, rhythm, tempo, dynamics
**Instruments:** voice, body percussion
**Notation level:** none
**Listening repertoire:** Me, Myself and I - De La Soul, Fresh Prince of Bel-Air theme - DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince
**MMC reference:** MMC Year 1, Unit 1

## Why this study matters

Hey You! is a simple hip-hop/rap song that introduces pulse and rhythm through body percussion and chanting. The rap structure (rhythm-driven, repetitive) makes it accessible for non-singers and builds confidence in musical performance from the very first unit. The call-and-response structure is a natural entry point for young children.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils shout rather than project with control -- teach 'stage voice' vs shouting
2. Losing the pulse during the rap -- use a steady clap or drum to anchor tempo
3. All pupils performing the same part -- introduce simple layering with body percussion
