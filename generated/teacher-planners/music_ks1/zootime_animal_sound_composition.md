## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Sound Exploration and Musical Composition (MU-KS1-C006)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Musical composition at KS1 begins with free exploration and experimentation rather than formal musical notation. Pupils experiment with how sounds can be created, modified and combined: they try different ways of striking, blowing or scraping instruments; they explore how the inter-related dimensions of music (pitch, duration, dynamics, tempo, timbre, texture and structure) can be manipulated to create different effects; and they begin to make deliberate choices about which sounds to combine and how to organise them into a simple musical piece. This creative sound exploration develops musical imagination and prepares pupils for more structured composition in later years, building intuitive understanding of musical structure through doing rather than through abstract rules.

**Teaching guidance:** Provide rich opportunities for sound exploration with tuned and untuned percussion, body percussion, found sounds and voices. Give composition tasks with creative constraints rather than total freedom: 'make a sound picture of a storm using four instruments' or 'compose a piece that changes from quiet to loud'. Encourage pupils to reflect on their choices: why did you use that instrument there? What did you change and why? Develop the ability to perform compositions consistently: this requires some form of notation or memory strategy (graphic notation, memory cues, a sequence of pictures). Connect composition to listening and performing: analysing how a piece they have listened to is structured informs their own compositional choices.

**Key vocabulary:** compose, create, experiment, combine, select, sound, instrument, pitch, dynamics, tempo, timbre, texture, structure, improvise, musical idea

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may believe that composition requires knowing how to write musical notation; at KS1, composition is about making musical decisions and can be recorded through graphic notation, memory or teacher transcription. Some pupils may feel that their musical ideas are wrong because they do not sound like familiar music; developing aesthetic confidence and valuing diverse musical outcomes prevents self-censorship. Pupils may not recognise that performing consistently requires some form of memory or notation: developing simple graphic notation or verbal sequencing makes composition more repeatable.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Exploring sounds freely using classroom instruments and the voice, discovering what different sounds can be made. | Choose an instrument. Find three different ways to make a sound with it. | Only using one technique to play an instrument; Being too rough with instruments and not controlling the sound |
| **Developing** | Selecting and ordering sounds to create a short piece with a clear beginning, middle and end. | Create a short piece of music with a beginning, a middle and an end. Choose your sounds and put them in order. | Making random sounds without any intentional order or structure; Not creating a clear ending so the piece just stops |
| **Expected** | Composing a short piece that uses deliberate musical choices — selecting sounds for their qualities, organising them into a structure, and being able to explain and repeat the composition. | Compose a piece of music for three instruments that tells the story of a day at the seaside. Make sure you can perform it the same way twice. | Creating a piece that cannot be repeated because it was improvised without a plan; Not using musical structure (repetition, contrast, return) to organise the piece |

> **Model response (Entry):** *I chose the tambourine. I can shake it, tap it with my hand, and scrape my finger along the skin. Each way makes a different sound.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Beginning: three slow taps on the drum. Middle: fast shaking of the maracas getting louder. End: one quiet ding on the triangle. I chose these because the drum starts the piece, the maracas build excitement in the middle, and the triangle ends it with a clear, clean sound.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Section A (morning): gentle woodblock tapping for footsteps on the sand, with quiet ocean drum underneath. Section B (playing): fast tambourine for splashing in the waves, glockenspiel for seagull calls overhead. Section A again (evening): back to gentle woodblock and ocean drum, getting quieter. I used ABA structure so the day starts and ends the same way. I can repeat it because I remember the pattern.*

### Secondary concept: Timbre and Texture (MU-KS1-C004)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Timbre is the distinctive quality or tone colour of a sound that allows us to tell different instruments and voices apart. Texture describes how many sounds are heard simultaneously and how they interact - whether music is thin or thick, sparse or rich. At KS1, pupils develop their ability to recognise and describe different timbres and begin to understand how texture can vary in music.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recognising that different instruments and voices have different sounds (timbres), and sorting sounds into categories. | Not being able to distinguish between instruments by sound alone; Describing all instruments as just 'loud' or 'quiet' without noticing timbre |
| **Developing** | Describing the timbre of sounds using musical vocabulary (bright, dull, warm, harsh, smooth, rough) and identifying thin and thick textures. | Confusing timbre (quality of individual sounds) with texture (how sounds combine); Using only 'nice' or 'good' instead of specific musical vocabulary |
| **Expected** | Choosing instruments deliberately for their timbre to achieve a specific musical effect, and creating contrasts in texture within a group performance. | Choosing instruments randomly rather than for their timbral qualities; Having all instruments play the whole time instead of creating textural variety |

### Secondary concept: Inter-Related Dimensions of Music (MU-KS1-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

The inter-related dimensions of music are the building blocks used to create and describe music: pitch, duration, dynamics, tempo, timbre, texture, structure and notation. They are inter-related because changes to one dimension affect how others are perceived. At KS1, pupils begin to use these dimensions both as a creative toolkit for composing and as a vocabulary for discussing and appraising music.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying individual musical dimensions — whether music is high or low (pitch), loud or quiet (dynamics), fast or slow (tempo) — when listening. | Confusing the dimensions (e.g. calling high notes 'loud'); Only being able to identify one dimension at a time |
| **Developing** | Using appropriate vocabulary for multiple dimensions when describing music, and beginning to notice how changing one dimension affects how the music sounds. | Using everyday language instead of musical vocabulary; Describing dimensions in isolation without noticing how they interact |
| **Expected** | Explaining how the inter-related dimensions work together to create a particular musical effect, and using this understanding when composing or performing. | Treating each dimension separately instead of explaining how they combine; Not recognising that the same piece can use dimensions in contrasting ways at different moments |

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** The inter-related dimensions of music provide a framework for noticing patterned variation — changes in timbre, texture, pitch and rhythm — which are the primary cognitive targets of attentive listening at KS1.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What is the same about these?
- What is different?
- What comes next?
- Can you sort these into groups?

**Secondary lens:** Perspective and Interpretation — Responding to and discussing music introduces pupils to the idea that the same piece can be heard differently by different listeners, making interpretive response a meaningful and discussable activity even at this age.

## Session structure: Creative Response

### Creative Response
A creative arts or writing sequence that develops technique through exposure to exemplary work, guided exploration of techniques, structured planning, independent creation, and peer critique. Balances creative freedom with technical skill development.

`exemplar_exposure` → `technique_exploration` → `planning` → `creating` → `critique`

**Assessment:** Final creative outcome (artwork, design, written piece) accompanied by a reflective evaluation discussing techniques used, influences, and areas for development.

**Teacher note:** Use the CREATIVE RESPONSE template: show children examples of artwork or creative writing that inspire curiosity and excitement. Let them explore materials and techniques through play and experimentation. Support them in planning what they want to make, then give them time to create. Encourage them to talk about what they made and what they like about it.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What do you notice about this artwork or writing?
- What materials or colours will you use?
- Can you tell me about what you have made?
- What is your favourite part? Why?

## Why this study matters

Composing a 'sound picture' of a zoo gives pupils a concrete creative brief for their first structured compositions. Each animal suggests different timbres, dynamics, and tempi -- a lion is loud and slow, a monkey is fast and chattering, a snake is quiet and smooth. Selecting instruments to represent animals teaches timbre awareness and the principle that sound can represent ideas.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils just make noise rather than composing -- set a structure (beginning, middle, end)
2. Everyone plays at once -- teach taking turns and layering sounds
3. Only using obvious sound effects -- challenge pupils to represent the mood of the animal, not just its voice
