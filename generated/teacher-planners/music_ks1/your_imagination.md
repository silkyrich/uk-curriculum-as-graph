## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Inter-Related Dimensions of Music (MU-KS1-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

The inter-related dimensions of music are the building blocks used to create and describe music: pitch, duration, dynamics, tempo, timbre, texture, structure and notation. They are inter-related because changes to one dimension affect how others are perceived. At KS1, pupils begin to use these dimensions both as a creative toolkit for composing and as a vocabulary for discussing and appraising music.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce dimensions progressively through practical musical activities. Use a visual display of the dimensions as a reference point. When listening to music, guide pupils to focus on one dimension at a time. When composing, challenge pupils to make a deliberate choice about one or two dimensions. Develop vocabulary lists for each dimension to support musical discussion. Use the dimensions to structure musical evaluations.

**Key vocabulary:** pitch, duration, dynamics, tempo, timbre, texture, structure, notation, dimension, inter-related

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may treat the dimensions as separate boxes rather than as interconnected elements. Activities that explore how changing one dimension affects the perception of others help build understanding of their inter-related nature. The term 'structure' can be confusing at KS1; begin with simple examples such as verse and chorus before more complex formal structures.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying individual musical dimensions — whether music is high or low (pitch), loud or quiet (dynamics), fast or slow (tempo) — when listening. | Listen to this music. Is it fast or slow? Loud or quiet? High or low? | Confusing the dimensions (e.g. calling high notes 'loud'); Only being able to identify one dimension at a time |
| **Developing** | Using appropriate vocabulary for multiple dimensions when describing music, and beginning to notice how changing one dimension affects how the music sounds. | Describe this piece using at least three musical dimensions: pitch, duration, dynamics, tempo, timbre, texture. | Using everyday language instead of musical vocabulary; Describing dimensions in isolation without noticing how they interact |
| **Expected** | Explaining how the inter-related dimensions work together to create a particular musical effect, and using this understanding when composing or performing. | Explain how the composer of this piece uses the musical dimensions together to create excitement. | Treating each dimension separately instead of explaining how they combine; Not recognising that the same piece can use dimensions in contrasting ways at different moments |

> **Model response (Entry):** *The music is fast and quite loud. The instrument is playing high notes that sound sparkly.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *This piece has a slow tempo and quiet dynamics. The pitch is mainly low. The timbre is warm because it is a cello. The texture is thin — just one instrument. It sounds calm and thoughtful because all these things work together.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *The tempo is fast, which immediately creates energy. The dynamics get louder and louder, building tension. The pitch rises higher, which adds to the feeling of climbing towards something. The texture gets thicker as more instruments join in. All these dimensions working together — fast, loud, high, thick — create excitement. If the composer only changed one dimension, it wouldn't be as effective.*

### Secondary concept: Pitch (MU-KS1-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Pitch is the quality of sound determined by the frequency of vibration - whether a sound is high or low. In music, pitch determines melody and harmony. At KS1, pupils develop their ability to hear, match and produce different pitches through singing, playing tuned instruments and using their voices expressively. Understanding pitch is fundamental to singing in tune and to understanding how melody works.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recognising that sounds can be high or low and using the voice to produce high and low sounds. | Confusing loud with high and quiet with low; Not being able to physically produce a high or low sound on command |
| **Developing** | Singing in tune with a group, matching pitch to a given note, and showing the direction of pitch (going up, going down, staying the same). | Not being able to distinguish whether a pitch is going up or down; Singing loudly instead of matching the target pitch |
| **Expected** | Singing with accurate pitch in a group performance and playing simple pitched patterns on tuned instruments, controlling pitch deliberately. | Hitting the wrong bars because of unfamiliarity with the instrument layout; Playing too quickly to control which notes are sounding |

### Secondary concept: Sound Exploration and Musical Composition (MU-KS1-C006)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Musical composition at KS1 begins with free exploration and experimentation rather than formal musical notation. Pupils experiment with how sounds can be created, modified and combined: they try different ways of striking, blowing or scraping instruments; they explore how the inter-related dimensions of music (pitch, duration, dynamics, tempo, timbre, texture and structure) can be manipulated to create different effects; and they begin to make deliberate choices about which sounds to combine and how to organise them into a simple musical piece. This creative sound exploration develops musical imagination and prepares pupils for more structured composition in later years, building intuitive understanding of musical structure through doing rather than through abstract rules.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Exploring sounds freely using classroom instruments and the voice, discovering what different sounds can be made. | Only using one technique to play an instrument; Being too rough with instruments and not controlling the sound |
| **Developing** | Selecting and ordering sounds to create a short piece with a clear beginning, middle and end. | Making random sounds without any intentional order or structure; Not creating a clear ending so the piece just stops |
| **Expected** | Composing a short piece that uses deliberate musical choices — selecting sounds for their qualities, organising them into a structure, and being able to explain and repeat the composition. | Creating a piece that cannot be repeated because it was improvised without a plan; Not using musical structure (repetition, contrast, return) to organise the piece |

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** Pulse, rhythm, pitch sequences and dynamic contours are all temporal or tonal patterns — KS1 performance is fundamentally about recognising, reproducing and internalising these musical patterns through the body.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What is the same about these?
- What is different?
- What comes next?
- Can you sort these into groups?

**Secondary lens:** Structure and Function — Tempo and dynamics are structural parameters whose manipulation changes the expressive function of a performance; even at KS1, varying these elements purposefully introduces the idea that musical structure shapes meaning.

---

## Session structure: Performance

### Performance
A sequence building towards a culminating performance in music, drama, or physical activity. Pupils study repertoire or material, develop technical skills through focused practice, rehearse with attention to expression and communication, perform to an audience (real or virtual), and evaluate their own and others' performances.

`repertoire_study` → `technique_development` → `rehearsal` → `performance` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Performance assessed against subject-specific criteria (musical accuracy, expression, dramatic impact, physical skill execution) plus reflective self-evaluation.

**Teacher note:** Use the PERFORMANCE template: let children listen to, watch, or experience an example performance that excites them. Help them practise simple techniques — singing, moving, playing — with lots of encouragement. Give them time to rehearse in small groups. Celebrate their performance and help them say what they enjoyed and what went well.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What did you notice about the performance?
- Can you show me how to do that?
- What did your group do well?
- What was your favourite part of performing?

## Music focus

**Genre:** Pop
**Composer/piece:**  — Your Imagination
**Musical elements:** structure, pitch, melody, dynamics
**Instruments:** voice, glockenspiel
**Notation level:** graphic
**Listening repertoire:** Don't Stop Believin' - Journey, Happy - Pharrell Williams
**MMC reference:** MMC Year 2, Unit 1

---

## Why this study matters

Your Imagination is a pop-style song that introduces basic song structure (verse, chorus) while encouraging creative musical responses. Pupils learn to identify and perform the verse and chorus, developing awareness of musical structure. Simple improvisation within a pentatonic scale (removing notes that sound 'wrong') builds confidence in musical creativity.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils sing verse and chorus at the same volume and energy -- teach dynamic contrast
2. Improvisation attempts too long -- limit to 4 beats at first
3. Not connecting singing to instrument playing -- combine vocal and glockenspiel parts
