## Concepts

This study delivers **0 primary concepts** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Secondary concept: Online Safety and Digital Citizenship (CO-KS12-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Online safety encompasses the knowledge, skills and behaviours needed to participate in digital environments safely, responsibly and positively. It includes protecting personal information, managing digital identity and reputation, recognising online risks (cyberbullying, inappropriate content, grooming, scams), evaluating online information critically and knowing how to seek help when needed. Digital citizenship extends this to include understanding the rights and responsibilities of online participation, including intellectual property, attribution and the ethics of digital communication. At KS1 and KS2, online safety is embedded throughout the computing curriculum.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Understanding basic online safety rules: not sharing personal information with strangers, telling a trusted adult if something makes them uncomfortable. | Thinking it is safe to share information because the person seems friendly; Not telling an adult because they think they will get in trouble |
| **Developing** | Understanding a wider range of online risks (cyberbullying, inappropriate content, unreliable information) and knowing strategies for dealing with them. | Believing everything found online is true; Not knowing how to identify reliable sources |
| **Expected** | Explaining how to manage their digital footprint, understanding how personal data is collected and used online, and acting as a responsible digital citizen. | Thinking that deleting a post removes it completely from the internet; Not understanding that their online activity creates a permanent record |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Online safety education is built on helping pupils understand the consequences of sharing personal information or behaving unkindly online — reasoning about cause and effect (what happens if I share this?) is the central cognitive demand.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What made that happen?
- What will happen if...?
- Why did it change?
- Can you finish: it happened because...?

**Secondary lens:** Perspective and Interpretation — Digital citizenship requires pupils to consider how their online actions are experienced by others, developing the perspective-taking that underpins responsible behaviour in digital environments.

## Session structure: Practical Application

### Practical Application
A hands-on sequence where pupils apply knowledge and skills to solve a practical problem or create a functional outcome. Begins with a real-world context, builds skills through rehearsal, guides design or planning, supports making or problem-solving, and concludes with evaluation against success criteria.

`context` → `skill_rehearsal` → `design` → `make_or_solve` → `evaluate`

**Assessment:** Practical outcome (solution, product, program) evaluated against defined success criteria, with written or verbal explanation of the process and decisions made.

## Computing focus

**Computational concepts:** digital literacy
**Abstraction level:** Visual
**Themes:** digital literacy, content creation

---

## Why this study matters

This unit teaches the fundamental digital literacy skills: creating content (text, images), organising it (folders, naming), saving it (storage), and retrieving it. These are foundational skills that every subsequent computing lesson assumes. Using a word processor or drawing program purposefully -- not just randomly clicking -- teaches that digital tools serve specific purposes, just like physical tools.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Just clicking buttons without purpose -- set a clear creative brief (make a poster, write a story)
2. Not teaching file saving -- pupils lose work and become frustrated; teach Save early and often
3. Ignoring file naming -- teach meaningful names (not 'Untitled' or random characters)

---

## Computational thinking skills (KS1)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Abstraction (KS1)** — Focus on the most important features of a problem or task while ignoring unnecessary detail; represent real-world actions as simple step-by-step instructions that capture the essential logic without irrelevant specifics.
- **Abstraction (KS2)** — Design programs and digital solutions by identifying the key variables, inputs and outputs relevant to a problem while deliberately ignoring peripheral details; use procedures and functions as abstractions that hide implementation complexity; apply abstraction when planning programs using pseudocode or flowcharts.
- **Abstraction (KS3)** — Design and evaluate computational abstractions that model the state and behaviour of real-world problems and physical systems; select appropriate levels of abstraction for a given problem context; use abstract data types, classes and interfaces to hide implementation detail; understand the layered abstractions present in computing systems from hardware to application.
- **Decomposition (KS1)** — Break a familiar task or problem into a sequence of smaller, ordered steps; understand that a complex instruction can be split into simpler sub-instructions that together achieve the same goal; apply this thinking when giving instructions to a programmable toy or creating a simple program.
- **Decomposition (KS2)** — Decompose a complex programming problem or digital project into distinct, manageable sub-problems that can be developed and tested independently; plan program structure using top-down design before coding; use procedures and functions as the coded expression of decomposed sub-problems.
- **Decomposition (KS3)** — Design and develop modular programs that use procedures and functions to decompose complex problems; apply top-down and bottom-up design strategies; decompose data requirements as well as procedural logic, selecting appropriate data structures for each sub-problem; evaluate how modular decomposition improves code readability, maintainability and reuse.
