## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Staff Notation (MU-KS2-C004)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Staff notation is the standardised system of writing music using a five-line stave, clefs, note heads and rhythmic values. It allows music to be written down accurately and communicated to performers who have not heard the piece. At KS2, pupils learn to read and write staff notation, beginning with treble clef notes and simple rhythmic values, connecting this to their instrumental learning and composition work.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce staff notation in the context of instrumental learning, connecting written symbols to sounds pupils already know. Use mnemonics for note names (Every Good Boy Deserves Football for EGBDF). Practice reading short melodic fragments by ear first, then by sight. Teach rhythmic values (crotchet, minim, quaver) alongside their sound and feel. Use pupils' own compositions as a context for notation practice. Emphasise that notation represents sound; always connect written symbols to the sounds they represent.

**Key vocabulary:** stave, clef, treble, note, pitch, crotchet, minim, semibreve, quaver, bar line, time signature, rest, sharp, flat, natural

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils sometimes learn note names as abstract symbols without connecting them to specific sounds on their instrument. Always reinforcing the sound alongside the symbol prevents disconnected learning. The time signature is often misunderstood as a fraction rather than as information about pulse grouping; consistent practical activities reinforce its musical meaning.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recognising that music can be written down and reading simple graphic or rhythm notation. | These symbols show short sounds (filled circles) and long sounds (open circles). Clap the pattern. | Ignoring the notation and clapping their own pattern; Not distinguishing between the different note lengths shown |
| **Developing** | Reading and writing simple staff notation: note names on the treble clef, crotchets, minims, quavers and rests. | Read these notes on the stave and play them on the glockenspiel: C, D, E, rest, E, D, C. | Confusing line notes with space notes on the stave; Not giving the rest its full value — skipping straight to the next note |
| **Expected** | Reading and performing from staff notation with fluency, writing their own compositions in standard notation, and understanding time signatures. | Write out your composition in staff notation so someone else can play it. Include note names, rhythms and dynamics. | Writing bars with the wrong number of beats for the time signature; Not including dynamics or other performance directions in the notation |

> **Model response (Entry):** *I clapped: short short long short short long. The filled circles are quick claps and the open circles are held for longer.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *I identified C on the ledger line below the stave, D in the first space, and E on the first line. I played them in order and left a silence for the rest. The melody goes up then back down.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *I wrote my melody in 4/4 time on the treble clef. The first bar has four crotchets: C, D, E, F. The second bar has a minim (E) and two crotchets (D, C). I added 'p' at the start for quiet and 'f' in bar 3 for loud. I checked that each bar has four beats.*

### Secondary concept: Ensemble Performance Skills (MU-KS2-C001)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Ensemble performance requires musicians to listen to and coordinate with others while maintaining their own part, developing skills of listening, timing, balance and musical communication. At KS2, pupils develop the ability to play in groups, adjust their contribution to the ensemble, follow a conductor and manage the social and musical demands of collaborative music making.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Playing a simple part in a group, keeping in time with others by following a steady pulse. | Speeding up when nervous or getting louder to hear themselves over the group; Not listening to other parts and playing independently |
| **Developing** | Maintaining an independent part within an ensemble, adjusting volume and timing to blend with the group. | Switching to the other group's part when they hear it; Playing too loudly or too quietly relative to the ensemble balance |
| **Expected** | Performing with awareness of the ensemble, following a conductor or leader, adjusting dynamics and timing, and contributing musically to the overall sound. | Not watching the conductor and missing entry or dynamic changes; Focusing entirely on their own part without awareness of the overall ensemble sound |

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** Accuracy and fluency in performance depend on internalising rhythmic and melodic patterns deeply enough to reproduce them reliably under the added cognitive load of ensemble coordination.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- What pattern can you see?
- Does this always happen, or can you find an exception?
- What rule connects these examples?
- What would you predict for the next one? Why?

**Secondary lens:** Systems and System Models — Ensemble performance is a system in which individual parts must function in coordinated relationship — listening, balance, cueing and musical communication are all properties of the ensemble as an interdependent system rather than of individual players.

---

## Session structure: Performance

### Performance
A sequence building towards a culminating performance in music, drama, or physical activity. Pupils study repertoire or material, develop technical skills through focused practice, rehearse with attention to expression and communication, perform to an audience (real or virtual), and evaluate their own and others' performances.

`repertoire_study` → `technique_development` → `rehearsal` → `performance` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Performance assessed against subject-specific criteria (musical accuracy, expression, dramatic impact, physical skill execution) plus reflective self-evaluation.

**Teacher note:** Use the PERFORMANCE template: study a piece of repertoire or movement sequence, identifying specific techniques. Provide structured practice to develop those techniques with attention to accuracy and expression. Guide rehearsal with clear goals for improvement each session. Include performance to an audience and structured evaluation focusing on what went well and specific improvements.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What techniques are important in this piece?
- What do you need to practise to improve?
- How did the rehearsal help you get better?
- What went well in the performance, and what would you work on next?

## Music focus

**Musical elements:** pitch, notation, rhythm, pulse
**Instruments:** glockenspiel
**Notation level:** staff intro
**MMC reference:** MMC Year 3, Unit 2

## Why this study matters

Dedicated instrumental technique lessons are essential alongside song-based units. Glockenspiel Stage 1 teaches the relationship between written notation and physical playing: note name to bar position to sound. Starting with C, D, E (three adjacent notes) builds confidence before expanding range. The focus on accuracy and fluency rather than speed develops good practice habits.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils look at their hands rather than the notation -- build reading fluency gradually
2. Beaters bouncing off the bars -- teach the controlled 'drop and bounce' technique
3. Racing ahead of the class -- use a metronome or conductor to keep everyone together
