## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Ensemble Performance Skills (MU-KS2-C001)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Ensemble performance requires musicians to listen to and coordinate with others while maintaining their own part, developing skills of listening, timing, balance and musical communication. At KS2, pupils develop the ability to play in groups, adjust their contribution to the ensemble, follow a conductor and manage the social and musical demands of collaborative music making.

**Teaching guidance:** Create regular ensemble opportunities in whole-class instrumental lessons, recorder groups, or percussion ensembles. Teach pupils to listen across the ensemble while playing their own part. Use simple conducting gestures to direct starts, stops and dynamic changes. Develop listening challenges: can pupils hear all the parts? Can they identify when their part is dominant and when it should blend? Use rounds and partner songs to develop independent part-playing.

**Key vocabulary:** ensemble, solo, blend, balance, part, conductor, cue, coordination, listen, independent, unison, harmony

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often focus only on their own part and do not listen to others in an ensemble. Teaching that ensemble music requires active listening as well as playing is key. Some pupils may feel that playing quietly means playing badly; teaching about musical balance and the importance of dynamic blend within an ensemble addresses this.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Playing a simple part in a group, keeping in time with others by following a steady pulse. | Play this simple rhythm pattern on a drum while the rest of the group play a different pattern. Keep in time together. | Speeding up when nervous or getting louder to hear themselves over the group; Not listening to other parts and playing independently |
| **Developing** | Maintaining an independent part within an ensemble, adjusting volume and timing to blend with the group. | Play your recorder part in the ensemble piece. You have a different melody from the other group — keep your part steady while listening to theirs. | Switching to the other group's part when they hear it; Playing too loudly or too quietly relative to the ensemble balance |
| **Expected** | Performing with awareness of the ensemble, following a conductor or leader, adjusting dynamics and timing, and contributing musically to the overall sound. | Perform a two-part piece with your class. Follow the conductor for starts, stops and dynamic changes. | Not watching the conductor and missing entry or dynamic changes; Focusing entirely on their own part without awareness of the overall ensemble sound |

> **Model response (Entry):** *I played my pattern — ta ta ta rest — over and over while the others played their parts. I listened to the pulse and watched the person leading to stay in time.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *I played my part and heard that the other group had a different melody happening at the same time. I adjusted my volume to match theirs so neither part was too loud. When they played louder, I played a bit louder too to keep the balance.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *I watched the conductor for the opening beat and started exactly together with my group. When the conductor signalled quieter, I reduced my volume smoothly. I maintained my part throughout, listening to how it combined with the other part to create harmony. At the end, we all stopped cleanly on the conductor's signal.*

### Secondary concept: Music History and Cultural Context (MU-KS2-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Music has a rich history spanning many centuries and cultures, with different traditions, genres and styles each having distinctive features and contexts. At KS2, pupils develop understanding of the history of music and appreciation for a wide range of musical traditions, including the works of great composers and musicians. This historical and cultural knowledge enriches pupils' listening and informs their own musical making.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Listening to music from different times and places and expressing a personal response, identifying basic features. | Dismissing unfamiliar music without listening carefully; Describing only whether they 'like' it without noting musical features |
| **Developing** | Describing key features of music from different genres, traditions or historical periods using appropriate musical vocabulary. | Using vague language instead of specific musical vocabulary; Not connecting musical features to the style or period |
| **Expected** | Analysing and comparing music from different traditions with understanding of how historical, social and cultural contexts shape musical style and practice. | Treating non-Western music as simpler or less sophisticated; Comparing music without considering the cultural context that shaped it |

## Thinking lens: Systems and System Models (primary)

**Key question:** What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?

**Why this lens fits:** Ensemble performance is a system in which individual parts must function in coordinated relationship — listening, balance, cueing and musical communication are all properties of the ensemble as an interdependent system rather than of individual players.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- What goes into this system, and what comes out?
- If you changed this one part, what else would be affected?
- Where does this system start and end?
- How could we draw a model to explain how this works?

**Secondary lens:** Perspective and Interpretation — Appreciating music from diverse traditions and historical periods requires pupils to listen from within unfamiliar aesthetic frameworks — recognising that what counts as musical quality is culturally and historically situated, not universal.

## Session structure: Performance

### Performance
A sequence building towards a culminating performance in music, drama, or physical activity. Pupils study repertoire or material, develop technical skills through focused practice, rehearse with attention to expression and communication, perform to an audience (real or virtual), and evaluate their own and others' performances.

`repertoire_study` → `technique_development` → `rehearsal` → `performance` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Performance assessed against subject-specific criteria (musical accuracy, expression, dramatic impact, physical skill execution) plus reflective self-evaluation.

**Teacher note:** Use the PERFORMANCE template: study a piece of repertoire or movement sequence, identifying specific techniques. Provide structured practice to develop those techniques with attention to accuracy and expression. Guide rehearsal with clear goals for improvement each session. Include performance to an audience and structured evaluation focusing on what went well and specific improvements.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What techniques are important in this piece?
- What do you need to practise to improve?
- How did the rehearsal help you get better?
- What went well in the performance, and what would you work on next?

## Music focus

**Genre:** R And B
**Composer/piece:** Bill Withers — Lean on Me
**Musical elements:** pitch, melody, dynamics, texture, structure
**Instruments:** voice, glockenspiel
**Notation level:** rhythm only
**Listening repertoire:** Ain't No Sunshine - Bill Withers, Stand By Me - Ben E. King, I'll Be There - The Jackson 5
**MMC reference:** MMC Year 4, Unit 1

---

## Why this study matters

Bill Withers' Lean on Me is a soul classic with a simple, singable melody and a strong message about community. The song introduces singing in two parts (melody and harmony), which is a significant step up from KS1 unison singing. The piano-based accompaniment translates well to glockenspiel with two distinct parts (melody and bass line).

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Harmony part gravitates back to the melody -- practise each part separately first
2. Losing tempo during the a cappella sections -- keep the pulse internalised
3. Dynamic contrast between verse and chorus missed -- teach the 'swell' on the chorus
