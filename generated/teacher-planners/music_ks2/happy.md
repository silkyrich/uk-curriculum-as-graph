## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Improvisation (MU-KS2-C002)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Improvisation is the creation of music spontaneously in performance, without prior written notation. It requires musical knowledge and skill, creative confidence and the ability to make instant decisions. At KS2, pupils develop improvisation skills through structured activities that provide a framework (scale, rhythm, harmonic context) within which they can make free musical choices.

**Teaching guidance:** Begin with very structured improvisation frameworks - improvise using only two or three notes over a drone or ostinato. Gradually increase freedom by expanding the note set or the rhythmic palette. Use call-and-response structures. Encourage pupils to improvise short phrases and to listen to and build on each other's ideas. Discuss the difference between improvisation (spontaneous) and composition (planned). Connect to listening by pointing out improvisation in jazz and world music examples.

**Key vocabulary:** improvise, spontaneous, phrase, motif, scale, drone, ostinato, response, idea, explore, create, structure

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often fear improvisation because they believe there is a 'right answer'. Framing improvisation as creative exploration rather than performance of a correct sequence helps. Some pupils may produce random sequences of notes rather than musical phrases; teaching phrase length and resolution helps develop more musical improvisation.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Creating short musical responses spontaneously within a given framework, such as answering a musical question. | I will play a short musical phrase (the question). You make up an answer phrase straight away on your instrument. | Freezing and not being able to respond spontaneously; Copying the question exactly instead of creating something new |
| **Developing** | Improvising melodic and rhythmic phrases that fit within a given tonality, time signature or mood. | Improvise a melody using only the notes C, D, E, G, A (pentatonic scale) while the class plays a steady accompaniment. | Playing too many notes too quickly without musical shape or phrasing; Not listening to the accompaniment while improvising |
| **Expected** | Improvising with confidence and musical awareness, varying phrases, using dynamics and phrasing expressively, and responding to other performers in the moment. | Improvise a short piece in a group: one person plays a rhythm, another improvises a melody, and a third adds dynamics. Respond to each other as you play. | Playing without listening to the other performers; Not varying their improvisation — playing the same ideas throughout |

> **Model response (Entry):** *You played four notes going up. I played four notes going down, ending on a low note. It sounded like a conversation.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *I played short phrases using the five notes, leaving gaps between phrases so it didn't sound rushed. I repeated some patterns and changed others. I ended on C because it sounded like a natural ending point. The notes all sounded good together because of the pentatonic scale.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *I listened to the rhythm pattern and improvised a melody that fitted with it. When the rhythm got more energetic, I played higher and faster. When it calmed down, I played slower, lower phrases. The dynamics player made us all quieter in the middle, which created a nice contrast. We were listening and responding to each other, making the music together.*

### Secondary concept: Ensemble Performance Skills (MU-KS2-C001)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Ensemble performance requires musicians to listen to and coordinate with others while maintaining their own part, developing skills of listening, timing, balance and musical communication. At KS2, pupils develop the ability to play in groups, adjust their contribution to the ensemble, follow a conductor and manage the social and musical demands of collaborative music making.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Playing a simple part in a group, keeping in time with others by following a steady pulse. | Speeding up when nervous or getting louder to hear themselves over the group; Not listening to other parts and playing independently |
| **Developing** | Maintaining an independent part within an ensemble, adjusting volume and timing to blend with the group. | Switching to the other group's part when they hear it; Playing too loudly or too quietly relative to the ensemble balance |
| **Expected** | Performing with awareness of the ensemble, following a conductor or leader, adjusting dynamics and timing, and contributing musically to the overall sound. | Not watching the conductor and missing entry or dynamic changes; Focusing entirely on their own part without awareness of the overall ensemble sound |

## Thinking lens: Systems and System Models (primary)

**Key question:** What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?

**Why this lens fits:** Ensemble performance is a system in which individual parts must function in coordinated relationship — listening, balance, cueing and musical communication are all properties of the ensemble as an interdependent system rather than of individual players.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- What goes into this system, and what comes out?
- If you changed this one part, what else would be affected?
- Where does this system start and end?
- How could we draw a model to explain how this works?

**Secondary lens:** Structure and Function — Musical Structure and Composition (C003) makes structure the explicit object of compositional learning — understanding how sections, motifs and structural forms organise musical material to create coherent expressive effect.

---

## Session structure: Performance

### Performance
A sequence building towards a culminating performance in music, drama, or physical activity. Pupils study repertoire or material, develop technical skills through focused practice, rehearse with attention to expression and communication, perform to an audience (real or virtual), and evaluate their own and others' performances.

`repertoire_study` → `technique_development` → `rehearsal` → `performance` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Performance assessed against subject-specific criteria (musical accuracy, expression, dramatic impact, physical skill execution) plus reflective self-evaluation.

**Teacher note:** Use the PERFORMANCE template: study a piece of repertoire or movement sequence, identifying specific techniques. Provide structured practice to develop those techniques with attention to accuracy and expression. Guide rehearsal with clear goals for improvement each session. Include performance to an audience and structured evaluation focusing on what went well and specific improvements.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What techniques are important in this piece?
- What do you need to practise to improve?
- How did the rehearsal help you get better?
- What went well in the performance, and what would you work on next?

## Music focus

**Genre:** Pop
**Composer/piece:** Pharrell Williams — Happy
**Musical elements:** pitch, rhythm, structure, dynamics, melody
**Instruments:** voice, glockenspiel, ukulele
**Notation level:** rhythm only
**Listening repertoire:** Get Lucky - Daft Punk ft. Pharrell, Lovely Day - Bill Withers
**MMC reference:** MMC Year 5, Unit 4

---

## Why this study matters

Pharrell Williams' Happy combines pop performance with improvisation opportunities. The simple four-chord loop is ideal for teaching improvisation within a harmonic framework -- pupils improvise 4-bar melodic phrases over the repeating chords. This is structured improvisation, not free improvisation, and teaches that constraints enable creativity rather than restricting it.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Improvisation attempts too wild -- limit to pentatonic scale notes first
2. Losing the 4-bar phrase length -- count bars aloud as a class
3. Everyone improvising at once -- take turns, one soloist over the group accompaniment

| Example correct feedback | *You recognised that 1/2 is larger than 2/5, and used the common denominator method correctly. The visualiser confirms it — the bar for 1/2 is noticeably longer.* |
| Example error feedback | *The reasoning does not quite hold: you said both fractions are the same because the numerator in 2/5 is double the numerator in 1/2. But the denominator changed too — the pieces got smaller. Converting to tenths: 1/2 = 5/10 and 2/5 = 4/10. Which is larger now?* |
