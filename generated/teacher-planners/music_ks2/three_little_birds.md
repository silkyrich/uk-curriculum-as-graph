## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **0 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Ensemble Performance Skills (MU-KS2-C001)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Ensemble performance requires musicians to listen to and coordinate with others while maintaining their own part, developing skills of listening, timing, balance and musical communication. At KS2, pupils develop the ability to play in groups, adjust their contribution to the ensemble, follow a conductor and manage the social and musical demands of collaborative music making.

**Teaching guidance:** Create regular ensemble opportunities in whole-class instrumental lessons, recorder groups, or percussion ensembles. Teach pupils to listen across the ensemble while playing their own part. Use simple conducting gestures to direct starts, stops and dynamic changes. Develop listening challenges: can pupils hear all the parts? Can they identify when their part is dominant and when it should blend? Use rounds and partner songs to develop independent part-playing.

**Key vocabulary:** ensemble, solo, blend, balance, part, conductor, cue, coordination, listen, independent, unison, harmony

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often focus only on their own part and do not listen to others in an ensemble. Teaching that ensemble music requires active listening as well as playing is key. Some pupils may feel that playing quietly means playing badly; teaching about musical balance and the importance of dynamic blend within an ensemble addresses this.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Playing a simple part in a group, keeping in time with others by following a steady pulse. | Play this simple rhythm pattern on a drum while the rest of the group play a different pattern. Keep in time together. | Speeding up when nervous or getting louder to hear themselves over the group; Not listening to other parts and playing independently |
| **Developing** | Maintaining an independent part within an ensemble, adjusting volume and timing to blend with the group. | Play your recorder part in the ensemble piece. You have a different melody from the other group — keep your part steady while listening to theirs. | Switching to the other group's part when they hear it; Playing too loudly or too quietly relative to the ensemble balance |
| **Expected** | Performing with awareness of the ensemble, following a conductor or leader, adjusting dynamics and timing, and contributing musically to the overall sound. | Perform a two-part piece with your class. Follow the conductor for starts, stops and dynamic changes. | Not watching the conductor and missing entry or dynamic changes; Focusing entirely on their own part without awareness of the overall ensemble sound |

> **Model response (Entry):** *I played my pattern — ta ta ta rest — over and over while the others played their parts. I listened to the pulse and watched the person leading to stay in time.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *I played my part and heard that the other group had a different melody happening at the same time. I adjusted my volume to match theirs so neither part was too loud. When they played louder, I played a bit louder too to keep the balance.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *I watched the conductor for the opening beat and started exactly together with my group. When the conductor signalled quieter, I reduced my volume smoothly. I maintained my part throughout, listening to how it combined with the other part to create harmony. At the end, we all stopped cleanly on the conductor's signal.*

## Thinking lens: Systems and System Models (primary)

**Key question:** What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?

**Why this lens fits:** Ensemble performance is a system in which individual parts must function in coordinated relationship — listening, balance, cueing and musical communication are all properties of the ensemble as an interdependent system rather than of individual players.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- What goes into this system, and what comes out?
- If you changed this one part, what else would be affected?
- Where does this system start and end?
- How could we draw a model to explain how this works?

**Secondary lens:** Patterns — Accuracy and fluency in performance depend on internalising rhythmic and melodic patterns deeply enough to reproduce them reliably under the added cognitive load of ensemble coordination.

---

## Session structure: Performance

### Performance
A sequence building towards a culminating performance in music, drama, or physical activity. Pupils study repertoire or material, develop technical skills through focused practice, rehearse with attention to expression and communication, perform to an audience (real or virtual), and evaluate their own and others' performances.

`repertoire_study` → `technique_development` → `rehearsal` → `performance` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Performance assessed against subject-specific criteria (musical accuracy, expression, dramatic impact, physical skill execution) plus reflective self-evaluation.

**Teacher note:** Use the PERFORMANCE template: study a piece of repertoire or movement sequence, identifying specific techniques. Provide structured practice to develop those techniques with attention to accuracy and expression. Guide rehearsal with clear goals for improvement each session. Include performance to an audience and structured evaluation focusing on what went well and specific improvements.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What techniques are important in this piece?
- What do you need to practise to improve?
- How did the rehearsal help you get better?
- What went well in the performance, and what would you work on next?

## Music focus

**Genre:** Reggae
**Composer/piece:** Bob Marley — Three Little Birds
**Musical elements:** rhythm, pulse, structure, dynamics
**Instruments:** voice, glockenspiel
**Notation level:** rhythm only
**Listening repertoire:** One Love - Bob Marley, Stir It Up - Bob Marley, Red Red Wine - UB40
**MMC reference:** MMC Year 3, Unit 1

---

## Why this study matters

Bob Marley's Three Little Birds is one of the simplest and most effective songs for introducing ensemble performance at KS2. The reggae offbeat gives a distinctive rhythmic feel that is different from everything learned at KS1. The three-chord structure is ideal for first ukulele or glockenspiel accompaniment. The optimistic lyrics ('every little thing gonna be all right') set a positive tone for the year.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Missing the reggae offbeat -- clap on beats 2 and 4, not 1 and 3
2. Glockenspiel accompaniment too loud -- teach balance with voice
3. Singing too slowly -- reggae needs a relaxed but steady tempo

## Scaffolding and inclusion (Y3)

| Guideline | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Reading level | Developing Reader (Lexile 150–350) |
| Text-to-speech | Available |
| Max sentence length | 14 words |
| Vocabulary | Subject vocabulary with inline glossary support. Abstract concepts grounded in familiar contexts. Similes and comparisons helpful (e.g., 'solid is like a brick'). |
| Scaffolding level | Moderate To High |
| Hint tiers | 3 tiers |
| Session length | 12–20 minutes |
| Worked examples | Required — Text + diagram narrated. Step-by-step with child input at key points ('What would you do next?'). |
| Feedback tone | Warm Competence Focused |
| Normalize struggle | Yes |
| Example correct feedback | *You spotted the pattern — all the multiples of 6 end in an even number. That is a really useful thing to notice.* |
| Example error feedback | *That one got you — 7×8 trips up a lot of people. Here is a trick: 7×7 is 49, so 7×8 is just 7 more, which gives 56.* |
