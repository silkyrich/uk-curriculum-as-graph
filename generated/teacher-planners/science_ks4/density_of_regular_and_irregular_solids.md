## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Particle Model, Density and Gas Laws (PH-KS4-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The particle model describes matter as composed of tiny particles in constant motion. In solids, particles vibrate about fixed positions; in liquids, particles can flow but remain in contact; in gases, particles move rapidly and are widely separated. Density (ρ = m/V) depends on particle mass and separation. Gas pressure is caused by particles colliding with the container walls. Increasing temperature increases the kinetic energy and speed of particles, increasing the rate and force of collisions.

**Teaching guidance:** Required Practical 19: measure density of regular solids (using ruler and balance), irregular solids (using Eureka can) and liquids (using measuring cylinder and balance). Pupils should be able to explain qualitatively all the gas laws using the particle model: Boyle's law (p inversely proportional to V at constant T); Charles' law (V directly proportional to T at constant p). Use absolute temperature (Kelvin): T(K) = T(°C) + 273. The combined gas law pV/T = constant applies to a fixed mass of gas.

**Key vocabulary:** particle model, density, pressure, kinetic energy, Kelvin, absolute temperature, Boyle's law, Charles' law, combined gas law, internal energy, random motion

**Common misconceptions:** Students use Celsius instead of Kelvin in gas law calculations. Students think pressure in a gas is caused by particles pushing on each other (it is actually caused by collisions with the container walls). Students also confuse density with weight or mass — density is mass per unit volume, a property of the material independent of the amount present.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Describes the particle arrangements in solids, liquids, and gases, and relates these to macroscopic properties such as shape, volume, and compressibility. | Describe the arrangement and movement of particles in a solid, liquid, and gas. | Drawing gas particles as stationary or evenly spaced rather than randomly distributed and moving; Stating that particles 'expand' when heated rather than that they move faster and spread further apart |
| **Developing** | Calculates density using ρ = m/V, describes how temperature relates to average kinetic energy of particles, and explains pressure in gases using particle collisions with container walls. | A metal block has mass 540 g and dimensions 10 cm × 5 cm × 4 cm. Calculate its density in kg/m³ and identify the likely metal. | Failing to convert cm³ to m³ correctly (1 m³ = 1,000,000 cm³, not 100 cm³); Mixing grams and kilograms without converting, giving an answer out by a factor of 1000 |
| **Secure** | Applies the gas laws (pV = constant at constant T; p/T = constant at constant V) to solve problems, links gas pressure to particle kinetic energy and collision frequency, and explains density differences between states using the particle model. | A sealed syringe contains 100 cm³ of gas at atmospheric pressure (100 kPa). The plunger is pushed in until the volume is 40 cm³. Calculate the new pressure, assuming constant temperature, and explain the result using particle theory. | Stating that particles 'move faster' when compressed at constant temperature — speed is unchanged, only collision frequency increases; Applying Boyle's law to situations where temperature changes, invalidating the constant-temperature assumption |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates the limitations of the simple particle model, applies gas law calculations to unfamiliar contexts, and analyses experimental methods for measuring density of regular and irregular objects including sources of error. | A student measures the density of an irregular stone by displacement. The stone has mass 156 g. Initial water level is 50.0 cm³ and rises to 107.8 cm³ when the stone is submerged. Calculate the density. The accepted density is 2800 kg/m³. Evaluate the experimental method and suggest why the result might differ. | Not identifying that trapped air bubbles systematically increase volume and therefore decrease the density calculation; Confusing systematic errors (air bubbles, porous stone) with random errors (reading the meniscus) in evaluation |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *In a solid, particles are closely packed in a regular arrangement and vibrate about fixed positions. In a liquid, particles are close together but irregularly arranged and can move past each other. In a gas, particles are far apart with no fixed arrangement and move rapidly in random directions.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Volume = 10 × 5 × 4 = 200 cm³ = 0.0002 m³. Mass = 540 g = 0.54 kg. Density = m/V = 0.54/0.0002 = 2700 kg/m³. This is the density of aluminium.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *p₁V₁ = p₂V₂, so 100 × 100 = p₂ × 40, p₂ = 10000/40 = 250 kPa. The pressure increases because the same number of gas particles now occupy a smaller volume. Particles hit the walls more frequently (more collisions per second per unit area), increasing the force per unit area, which is pressure. Temperature is constant so average kinetic energy of particles is unchanged.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Volume = 107.8 - 50.0 = 57.8 cm³ = 5.78 × 10⁻⁵ m³. Density = 0.156/5.78 × 10⁻⁵ = 2699 kg/m³. This is lower than 2800 kg/m³. Possible reasons: air bubbles trapped on the stone's surface increase the apparent volume, reducing calculated density. The stone may be porous, absorbing water and increasing the displaced volume reading over time. The measuring cylinder has a resolution of ±0.5 cm³, giving a percentage uncertainty of approximately ±0.9% in volume, which is the dominant source of random error. Using a Eureka can with a more precise measuring cylinder would improve accuracy.*

### Secondary concept: Energy Stores and Transfers (PH-KS4-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Energy is stored in physical systems in various ways: kinetic (moving objects), gravitational potential (objects above a reference level), elastic potential (deformed objects), chemical (fuels, food), thermal (hot objects), nuclear (unstable nuclei), electromagnetic (electric/magnetic fields). Energy is neither created nor destroyed (conservation of energy) but transferred between stores by mechanical work, electrical work, heating or radiation. Useful energy transfers are always accompanied by dissipation to the thermal store of the surroundings.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Identifies basic energy stores (kinetic, thermal, gravitational potential) and recognises that energy can be transferred between stores. | Describing energy as being 'used up' or 'created' rather than transferred between stores; Confusing energy stores with energy transfer pathways (e.g. saying 'sound energy store') |
| **Developing** | Describes energy transfers using correct store terminology, calculates kinetic and gravitational potential energy using standard formulae, and recognises conservation of energy. | Forgetting to state the assumption about negligible air resistance when equating GPE to KE; Using incorrect units or confusing mass in kg with weight in N in the GPE formula |
| **Secure** | Applies energy conservation quantitatively across multi-step problems, calculates efficiency, and draws and interprets Sankey diagrams for real systems. | Drawing Sankey diagram arrows that do not conserve total width (input width must equal sum of output widths); Confusing power (rate of energy transfer) with total energy transferred when calculating efficiency |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates energy transfer scenarios critically, combines power, work done, and efficiency in extended calculations, and analyses the limitations of energy models in real-world contexts. | Failing to identify multiple dissipation pathways and only listing one source of energy loss; Not linking the impossibility of 100% recovery to fundamental thermodynamic principles |

### Secondary concept: Specific Heat Capacity and Latent Heat (PH-KS4-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Specific heat capacity (c) is the energy required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of a material by 1°C: Q = mcΔT. Different materials require different amounts of energy for the same temperature change, which explains why water is used as a coolant and why land heats up faster than sea. Latent heat is the energy transferred during a change of state at constant temperature; specific latent heat (L) is the energy required per kilogram: Q = mL.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Recognises that different materials heat up at different rates and that changes of state require energy input or release without a temperature change. | Stating the metal 'has more heat' rather than explaining the rate of thermal energy transfer; Confusing temperature with thermal energy — believing a small hot object has more energy than a large warm one |
| **Developing** | Uses the specific heat capacity equation (E = mcΔθ) to calculate energy changes for heating and cooling, and identifies specific latent heat as the energy for a change of state. | Using the final temperature instead of the temperature change (Δθ) in the equation; Forgetting that during a change of state the temperature remains constant, so SHC equation does not apply |
| **Secure** | Combines SHC and specific latent heat calculations in multi-step problems, interprets heating curves showing plateaus at changes of state, and explains the particle model basis for these energy changes. | Not recognising that the gradient differs between solid, liquid, and gas phases because they have different SHC values; Confusing latent heat of fusion with latent heat of vaporisation or using the wrong value in calculations |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates experimental methods for determining SHC and latent heat, analyses sources of systematic error, and applies combined calculations to unfamiliar engineering or environmental contexts. | Stating the experimental value is 'wrong' without identifying the direction and cause of systematic error; Not recognising that energy losses always make the experimental SHC appear lower than the true value |

### Secondary concept: Newton's Laws of Motion (PH-KS4-C008)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Newton's first law: an object remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by a resultant force. Newton's second law: the resultant force on an object equals its mass times its acceleration (F = ma); the acceleration is in the direction of the resultant force. Newton's third law: when object A exerts a force on object B, object B exerts an equal and opposite force on object A (action-reaction pairs).

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Describes Newton's three laws qualitatively: objects remain at rest or constant velocity unless acted on by a force, force causes acceleration, and every action has an equal and opposite reaction. | Stating the action-reaction pair is weight and normal force (these act on the same object — not a Newton's third law pair); Believing that an object at rest has no forces acting on it, rather than recognising balanced forces |
| **Developing** | Applies F = ma to calculate force, mass, or acceleration. Draws and interprets free body diagrams showing all forces on an object. Uses Newton's third law to identify action-reaction force pairs acting on different objects. | Forgetting to calculate acceleration first and trying to use F = mv instead of F = ma; Not distinguishing between the driving force (from the engine) and the resultant force (driving force minus friction and air resistance) |
| **Secure** | Applies Newton's laws to multi-force problems including friction, air resistance, and terminal velocity. Interprets velocity-time graphs to determine acceleration and resultant force. Analyses the forces during real scenarios such as skydiving and braking. | Stating that air resistance is constant rather than velocity-dependent; Drawing the v-t graph with a sharp corner at terminal velocity rather than a smooth curve approaching the plateau |
| **Mastery** | Applies Newton's laws to complex and unfamiliar situations, evaluates the assumptions in simplified models, resolves forces on inclined planes, and analyses real-world applications including vehicle safety and space travel. | Using mg instead of mg cos θ for the normal reaction force on an inclined plane; Forgetting to include air resistance as an additional force that becomes significant at higher speeds |

### Secondary concept: Momentum and Impulse (PH-KS4-C009)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Momentum is the product of mass and velocity: p = mv. The total momentum of a system is conserved in any interaction where no external forces act (conservation of momentum). A force acting on an object changes its momentum: F = Δp/Δt (Newton's second law in terms of momentum). Impulse (FΔt) equals the change in momentum (Δp). Applying a force over a longer time to achieve the same change in momentum reduces the peak force (the principle behind safety features such as airbags and crumple zones).

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Recognises that momentum is related to both mass and velocity, and that collisions involve a transfer of momentum between objects. | Stating momentum depends only on speed without considering mass; Confusing momentum with kinetic energy |
| **Developing** | Calculates momentum using p = mv, applies the conservation of momentum to simple collisions and explosions, and determines the velocity of objects after a collision. | Forgetting to add the masses together for objects that stick together after collision; Not assigning correct signs to velocities when objects move in opposite directions |
| **Secure** | Applies conservation of momentum to two-dimensional collision and explosion problems, links force to rate of change of momentum (F = Δp/Δt), and explains how crumple zones and airbags reduce injury by extending the time of momentum change. | Stating the airbag 'absorbs momentum' rather than correctly explaining it increases the time over which momentum changes; Confusing force (instantaneous) with impulse (force × time = change in momentum) |
| **Mastery** | Analyses complex momentum problems involving elastic and inelastic collisions, evaluates whether kinetic energy is conserved alongside momentum, and applies impulse-momentum relationships to real engineering and safety scenarios. | Forgetting to use signed velocities for objects moving in opposite directions; Confusing conservation of momentum (always conserved in a closed system) with conservation of kinetic energy (only conserved in elastic collisions) |

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** Sorting, classifying and identifying similarities directly trains pupils to recognise regularities and use them to predict or generalise.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- How would you formalise this pattern mathematically?
- What are the limits of this pattern — where does it break down?
- Could this pattern be an artefact of how the data was collected?
- Does identifying the pattern tell us why it occurs?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Drawing conclusions from observations requires constructing a claim supported by specific evidence — not just describing what was seen.

## Session structure: Fair Test

### Fair Test
The classic scientific enquiry: formulating a testable question, making a prediction based on scientific understanding, designing a method that controls variables, collecting and recording data systematically, analysing results, and drawing a conclusion linked back to the original hypothesis.

`question` → `hypothesis` → `method` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `conclusion`

**Assessment:** Structured scientific report including question, hypothesis with reasoning, method with variables identified, results table/graph, and conclusion evaluating whether results support the hypothesis.

**Teacher note:** Use the FAIR TEST template: expect pupils to derive a testable hypothesis from scientific theory and design a rigorous method with appropriate controls, precision, and sample size. Guide analysis using statistical techniques or mathematical modelling where appropriate. Demand critical evaluation of validity, reliability, accuracy, and the extent to which results support or refute the hypothesis.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does your hypothesis follow from the underlying scientific theory?
- How have you ensured sufficient precision, accuracy, and reliability in your method?
- What statistical analysis supports your conclusion?
- To what extent do your results support the hypothesis, and what are the limitations?

## Variables

**Independent:** object/material tested
**Dependent:** density (kg/m³ or g/cm³)
**Controlled:** measurement technique consistency, temperature (materials expand when heated), same balance for all measurements

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- electronic balance (±0.01g)
- ruler with mm divisions
- vernier calipers (optional)
- eureka can (displacement can)
- measuring cylinder
- selection of regular solids (metal cubes, cylinders)
- selection of irregular solids (stones, keys)
- water
- paper towels

**Safety notes:** Mop up water spills promptly to prevent slipping. Handle metal blocks carefully — some have sharp edges. If using stone samples, check for loose fragments. Ensure eureka cans are stable on the bench. (Hazard level: low)

---

## Expected outcome

For regular solids: measure dimensions with a ruler, calculate volume (V = l×w×h for cuboids, V = πr²h for cylinders), measure mass, calculate density (ρ = m/V). For irregular solids: measure mass on a balance, measure volume by water displacement (eureka can or measuring cylinder), calculate density. Pupils compare their experimental values with accepted densities to identify materials. The particle model explains why different materials have different densities: particles have different masses and spacings.

**Recording format:** data table of dimensions, mass, volume, and calculated density, comparison with accepted density values, particle model diagram explaining density differences

---

## Enquiry type

### Fair Test
A controlled investigation where one variable is deliberately changed while all others are kept the same, to determine whether the changed variable has an effect on a measured outcome. The gold-standard enquiry type for causal questions in science.

**Question stems:**
- How does [independent variable] affect [dependent variable]?
- Does changing [variable] make a difference to [outcome]?
- What is the relationship between [variable A] and [variable B]?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What will you change? (independent variable)
- What will you measure or observe? (dependent variable)
- What will you keep the same? (controlled variables)
- What do you predict will happen? Why?
- Was your prediction correct? What does the evidence show?

## Known misconceptions

### Particles expand when heated
**What pupils may say:** Particles get bigger when they are heated.
**Correct explanation:** Particles do not change size when heated. What happens is that they gain kinetic energy and move faster. In a solid, they vibrate more; in a liquid, they move more freely; in a gas, they move faster and spread further apart. The substance expands because the particles move further apart, not because the particles themselves grow.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- When you heat a solid, do the particles get bigger or do they move more?
- If particles got bigger when heated, what would happen to the mass of the substance?
- Draw what you think happens to particles in a solid when it is heated.

### Heavy objects fall faster
**What pupils may say:** Heavier objects fall faster than lighter objects.
**Correct explanation:** In the absence of air resistance, all objects accelerate at the same rate due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s/s on Earth), regardless of their mass. A feather and a hammer dropped in a vacuum reach the ground at the same time. In air, different objects fall at different rates because of air resistance (which depends on shape and surface area, not mass). A heavy compact object falls faster than a light spread-out one because it experiences proportionally less air resistance relative to its weight.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- If you dropped a football and a tennis ball from the same height (ignoring air resistance), which would land first?
- Why does a feather fall more slowly than a coin in air? Is it because it is lighter?
- On the Moon (where there is no air), a hammer and feather were dropped together. What happened?

## Why this study matters

This required practical develops fundamental measurement skills: using rulers, balances, measuring cylinders, and displacement cans with appropriate precision. The distinction between regular and irregular solids teaches pupils to choose methods based on the situation — a transferable scientific skill. Calculating density in correct SI units and comparing with accepted values introduces the idea of measurement accuracy and material identification. The connection to the particle model ensures the practical is rooted in explanatory science, not just measurement.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Unit confusion — pupils mix up g/cm³ and kg/m³; be explicit about which units are being used and how to convert
2. Air bubbles trapped on the surface of irregular objects during displacement inflate the volume reading — tap the object gently or use a thin wire to lower it
3. Measuring cylinder readings are imprecise for small objects — use appropriately sized cylinders to maximise the volume change
