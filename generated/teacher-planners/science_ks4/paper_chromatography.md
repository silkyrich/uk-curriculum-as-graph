## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Chemical Analysis and Identification Techniques (CH-KS4-C015)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Chemical analysis involves systematic procedures for identifying unknown substances and assessing the purity of chemical samples. At GCSE, pupils develop proficiency in a range of qualitative analytical techniques: paper chromatography (separating mixture components using a solvent moving through chromatography paper, with Rf values calculated as distance moved by substance divided by distance moved by solvent); flame tests (identifying metal ions by the characteristic colour produced when compounds are heated in a flame); chemical precipitation tests (identifying ions in solution by adding reagents that form characteristic precipitates); and gas tests (identifying common gases by their characteristic reactions with test reagents). These techniques develop practical chemistry skills and the ability to connect observation to chemical knowledge.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach analytical techniques through practical work with genuine unknowns, not just with known samples whose identity pupils already know. For chromatography: calculate Rf values accurately, compare to reference values, and discuss why the same substance always produces the same Rf value under standard conditions. For flame tests: use a systematic approach, cleaning the wire between tests; connect the colour to the electronic structure of the metal ion (electron excitation and emission). For ion tests: develop a systematic approach moving from precipitation to further tests, mimicking the flowchart approach used in professional analysis. For gas tests: ensure pupils understand why each test is specific to each gas. Connect to industrial applications: water quality analysis, food safety testing, forensic science.

**Key vocabulary:** chromatography, Rf value, solvent, stationary phase, mobile phase, flame test, metal ion, precipitation, qualitative analysis, ion test, gas test, purity, formulation, mixture, separation, identification

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils frequently calculate Rf values incorrectly by dividing the wrong distances, or forgetting that the measurement must be to the centre of each spot. The flame test colours must be memorised accurately; pupils often confuse similar colours (lilac for potassium vs red for lithium). In chromatography, pupils may not understand why different substances move different distances: the key principle is the balance between solubility in the mobile phase (which carries substances) and affinity for the stationary phase (which retains them).

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can carry out basic chemical tests (e.g., testing a gas with a splint) but does not understand the underlying chemistry or how to approach identification of an unknown systematically. | Describe the test for hydrogen gas and state the positive result. | Confusing the hydrogen test (squeaky pop with lit splint) with the oxygen test (relights a glowing splint); Not specifying that the splint must be lit (not glowing) for the hydrogen test |
| **Developing** | Can carry out and interpret flame tests, gas tests and simple chemical tests for ions, and understands that pure substances have fixed melting and boiling points. | You have an unknown white powder. Describe the tests you would carry out to determine whether it contains sodium ions and carbonate ions. | Not cleaning the wire between flame tests, leading to contamination; Forgetting to test the gas produced with limewater — just seeing bubbles does not confirm carbonate |
| **Secure** | Designs systematic identification procedures for unknown substances, calculates and interprets Rf values in chromatography, and explains why each test is specific to the substance it identifies. | A student separates a dye mixture using paper chromatography. Spot A travels 6.2 cm and the solvent front travels 8.0 cm. Calculate the Rf value and explain what it tells us. | Measuring to the edge of the spot rather than the centre; Dividing the solvent front distance by the spot distance instead of the correct way round |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates the limitations of qualitative tests and the advantages of instrumental methods, applies systematic analytical approaches to complex unknowns, and connects analytical chemistry to real-world applications. | Compare the advantages of instrumental analysis methods (such as mass spectrometry or atomic emission spectroscopy) with the traditional chemical tests used at GCSE. | Dismissing traditional tests entirely in favour of instrumental methods without acknowledging their practical value; Not connecting analytical methods to specific real-world applications |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Hold a lit splint near the mouth of the test tube. If hydrogen is present, it burns with a squeaky pop.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *For sodium ions: carry out a flame test by dipping a clean nichrome wire loop in concentrated HCl, then into the powder, and holding it in a Bunsen flame. A persistent yellow-orange flame indicates sodium. For carbonate ions: add dilute hydrochloric acid to the powder. If bubbles are produced, test the gas with limewater — if the limewater turns milky (cloudy), the gas is CO₂, confirming carbonate ions are present.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Rf = distance moved by spot / distance moved by solvent front = 6.2 / 8.0 = 0.775. The Rf value is characteristic of a particular substance in a given solvent under specific conditions. By comparing this Rf value to reference data, the substance in spot A can be identified. If two spots from different samples have the same Rf value, they are likely the same substance. The Rf value depends on the balance between the substance's solubility in the mobile phase (which carries it up the paper) and its affinity for the stationary phase (which holds it back).*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Instrumental methods offer several advantages: 1) Sensitivity — they can detect substances at much lower concentrations (parts per billion) than chemical tests. 2) Speed — automated instruments process hundreds of samples per hour. 3) Accuracy — quantitative results with known precision, not subjective colour judgements. 4) Small sample size — only micrograms may be needed. 5) They can identify unknown substances by matching spectral patterns to databases. Traditional chemical tests have their own advantages: they are inexpensive, require no specialist equipment, and provide immediate results suitable for preliminary identification. In practice, the two approaches are complementary: preliminary chemical tests narrow down possibilities, and instrumental methods provide definitive identification. For example, in forensic science, a presumptive field test might indicate the presence of a drug, but mass spectrometry is required for court-admissible identification.*

### Secondary concept: Electronic Configuration and Periodic Trends (CH-KS4-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Electrons occupy shells at increasing distances from the nucleus, with the first shell holding up to 2 electrons and subsequent shells holding up to 8. The number of electrons in the outermost shell determines the chemical properties of an element. Elements in the same group have the same number of outer electrons and therefore similar chemical properties. Trends in reactivity, melting point and atomic radius can be explained by electronic configuration.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that elements are arranged in the periodic table and that elements in the same group have similar properties, but cannot explain why using electronic configuration. | Saying they react similarly 'because they are in the same group' without explaining the electronic basis; Writing electronic configurations with too many electrons in inner shells |
| **Developing** | Can write electronic configurations for elements 1-20, explain group and period trends, and predict properties of unfamiliar elements from their position in the periodic table. | Writing the configuration as 2,8,10 instead of 2,8,8,2; Confusing the trend for metals (reactivity increases down the group) with halogens (reactivity decreases down the group) |
| **Secure** | Explains reactivity trends for groups 1, 7 and 0 in terms of atomic structure, predicts properties of elements not studied, and links electronic configuration to bonding behaviour. | Using the group 1 reactivity argument (easier to lose electrons) for group 7 (which gains electrons); Not mentioning shielding by inner electron shells as a factor reducing nuclear attraction |
| **Mastery** | Analyses periodic trends quantitatively using data on ionisation energies and electronegativity, evaluates the limitations of the simple shell model, and explains transition metal properties. | Explaining the trend across a period but not down a group, or vice versa; Not acknowledging that the simple shell model has limitations for explaining anomalies |

### Secondary concept: Covalent Bonding and Molecular Structures (CH-KS4-C004)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Covalent bonding occurs when atoms share pairs of electrons to achieve full outer shells. Simple molecular substances consist of small molecules held together by weak intermolecular forces; they have low melting points and do not conduct electricity. Giant covalent structures (diamond, graphite, silicon dioxide) have very high melting points due to many strong covalent bonds throughout the structure. Graphite is unusual in conducting electricity due to delocalised electrons.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that covalent bonding involves sharing electrons and can name some simple covalent molecules, but confuses weak intermolecular forces with strong covalent bonds when explaining properties. | Saying 'water has weak bonds' rather than correctly distinguishing between strong intramolecular bonds and weak intermolecular forces; Thinking the covalent bonds break when water boils |
| **Developing** | Can draw dot-and-cross diagrams for common molecules, compare simple molecular and giant covalent structures, and explain diamond vs graphite properties. | Not mentioning that graphite has delocalised electrons between layers, which explains its electrical conductivity; Saying diamond is hard because of 'strong bonds' without specifying the three-dimensional network structure |
| **Secure** | Explains the properties of all four structure types (simple molecular, giant covalent, ionic, metallic) in terms of bonding and structure, and can predict properties of unfamiliar substances. | Assuming that because both contain covalent bonds, they should have similar properties; Not identifying the structure type as the determining factor for physical properties |
| **Mastery** | Analyses the relationship between molecular shape, polarity and intermolecular forces, evaluates the properties of nanomaterials, and applies bonding models to novel materials. | Describing graphene's properties without linking each property to a specific structural feature; Not explaining why graphene conducts electricity (delocalised electrons from the fourth bonding electron on each carbon) |

### Secondary concept: Moles and Stoichiometry (CH-KS4-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

The mole is the unit of amount of substance; 1 mole of any substance contains 6.02 × 10²³ particles (Avogadro's number). The relative formula mass (Mr) numerically equals the mass in grams of 1 mole. Stoichiometry uses balanced equations to determine the molar ratios of reactants and products, allowing calculation of the mass of any reactant or product if the mass of another is known.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that chemical equations must be balanced and that mass is conserved, but struggles with mole calculations and confuses mass with amount of substance. | Forgetting to multiply the mass of oxygen by 3; Adding atomic numbers instead of atomic masses |
| **Developing** | Can calculate Mr, convert between mass and moles using moles = mass/Mr, and use molar ratios from balanced equations, but makes errors in multi-step calculations. | Using the wrong molar ratio from the balanced equation; Dividing by Mr when they should multiply (or vice versa) in the final step |
| **Secure** | Performs multi-step stoichiometry calculations confidently, including limiting reagent problems and concentration calculations, and can explain the significance of conservation of mass. | Forgetting to convert cm³ to dm³ (divide by 1000); Using a 1:1 ratio instead of the correct 2:1 ratio from the balanced equation |
| **Mastery** | Applies stoichiometry to complex industrial and analytical contexts, evaluates sources of error in quantitative experiments, and uses the ideal gas equation for gas volume calculations. | Confusing precision with accuracy — precise results can be inaccurate if there is systematic error; Not distinguishing between systematic errors (consistent bias) and random errors (scatter around the true value) |

### Secondary concept: Hydrocarbons and Crude Oil (CH-KS4-C012)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Crude oil is a finite resource formed from the remains of ancient marine organisms over millions of years. It consists of a mixture of hydrocarbons (compounds containing only carbon and hydrogen) that are separated by fractional distillation. Longer hydrocarbon chains have stronger intermolecular forces, higher boiling points, greater viscosity and lower flammability. Cracking converts longer, less useful chain molecules into shorter, more useful ones.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that crude oil is a mixture of hydrocarbons and that it is separated by fractional distillation, but cannot explain why different fractions have different boiling points. | Including oxygen in the definition of hydrocarbons; Thinking fractional distillation produces pure compounds rather than mixtures (fractions) |
| **Developing** | Can explain fractional distillation in terms of boiling points and intermolecular forces, describe the properties and uses of different fractions, and explain why cracking is needed. | Saying longer chains have 'stronger bonds' without specifying that these are intermolecular forces, not covalent bonds; Confusing properties: longer chains have higher boiling points, higher viscosity and lower flammability |
| **Secure** | Explains the combustion products of hydrocarbons and their environmental impacts, writes balanced equations for complete and incomplete combustion, and explains the economic importance of cracking. | Not balancing the combustion equations correctly, especially for incomplete combustion; Confusing CO (carbon monoxide, toxic) with CO₂ (carbon dioxide, greenhouse gas) |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates the environmental and economic implications of fossil fuel dependence, compares alternative fuels, and explains the chemistry of polymer formation from alkene monomers produced by cracking. | Presenting hydrogen as automatically 'green' without considering how it is produced; Not comparing hydrogen with battery electric vehicles as competing solutions |

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** Chemistry at KS4 is rich in patterns — periodic table trends, reactivity series, reaction type categories — that allow pupils to predict the behaviour of unfamiliar substances.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- How would you formalise this pattern mathematically?
- What are the limits of this pattern — where does it break down?
- Could this pattern be an artefact of how the data was collected?
- Does identifying the pattern tell us why it occurs?

**Secondary lens:** Cause and Effect — Chemical reactions involve causal mechanisms (electron transfer causes bonding, acid-base reactions follow proton transfer) that explain observed phenomena rather than merely describing them.

---

## Session structure: Pattern Seeking

### Pattern Seeking
Enquiry focused on identifying relationships and regularities in data. Pupils pose questions about possible correlations, gather data through observation or measurement, organise and represent data graphically, identify patterns, and attempt to explain the underlying relationship.

`question` → `data_gathering` → `graphing` → `pattern_identification` → `explanation`

**Assessment:** Data presentation with appropriate graph or chart, written description of the pattern found, and explanation of the possible reasons for the pattern, including evaluation of the strength of evidence.

**Teacher note:** Use the PATTERN SEEKING template: frame an investigation that requires quantitative analysis of relationships between variables. Expect pupils to use appropriate statistical techniques to identify and test patterns, evaluate the strength and significance of correlations, and discuss the limitations of pattern-based reasoning including confounding variables and sampling bias.

**KS4 question stems:**
- What statistical test would you use to evaluate the significance of this pattern?
- What confounding variables might produce a spurious pattern?
- How does the strength of this correlation compare across different conditions?
- What are the limitations of drawing conclusions from pattern-based data alone?

---

## Variables

**Independent:** substance applied to the chromatography paper
**Dependent:** distance travelled by each spot (Rf value)
**Controlled:** solvent type, temperature, paper type, depth of solvent in beaker, same starting line position

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- chromatography paper
- pencil (NOT pen)
- ruler
- beaker
- watch glass or cling film
- selection of water-soluble inks or food colourings
- unknown samples
- solvent (water)
- capillary tubes or fine glass rods

**Safety notes:** Low risk with water as solvent. If using organic solvents (ethanol), ensure good ventilation and keep away from naked flames. Use a pencil, not a pen, for the start line — ink from a pen will run with the solvent. Handle chromatography paper by the edges to avoid contamination with finger oils. (Hazard level: low)

---

## Expected outcome

Different substances travel different distances up the paper depending on their solubility in the solvent and their attraction to the paper. Rf value = distance moved by substance / distance moved by solvent front. A pure substance produces a single spot. A mixture produces multiple spots. Unknown substances can be identified by comparing their Rf values with known reference substances run on the same chromatogram under the same conditions.

**Recording format:** annotated chromatogram with measurements, Rf value calculation table, identification of unknowns by Rf comparison

---

## Enquiry type

### Identifying and Classifying
An enquiry where pupils observe, identify, and sort objects, organisms, or materials into groups based on their observable characteristics. Develops careful observation, the ability to select relevant criteria for grouping, and understanding of why classification systems are useful in science.

**Question stems:**
- How can we sort these [items] into groups?
- What properties can we use to classify [these things]?
- Can you make a key to identify [these specimens]?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What can you observe about these [objects/organisms/materials]?
- What properties could you use to sort them?
- How have you decided which group each one belongs to?
- Could you sort them a different way? What would change?
- Can you make a key that someone else could use to identify them?

## Why this study matters

Chromatography is one of the most accessible analytical techniques at GCSE level because results are visual and the calculation (Rf) is straightforward. The practical teaches pupils that scientists identify substances through measurable physical properties rather than appearance alone. Comparing unknown Rf values with reference values introduces the concept of analytical standards — fundamental to forensic science, pharmaceutical quality control, and food safety.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils draw the start line in pen rather than pencil — the pen ink dissolves and runs with the solvent, ruining the chromatogram
2. The solvent level is above the start line — spots dissolve directly into the solvent rather than being carried up by capillary action
3. Pupils assume that Rf values are universal — Rf values only allow comparison when conditions (solvent, temperature, paper) are identical
