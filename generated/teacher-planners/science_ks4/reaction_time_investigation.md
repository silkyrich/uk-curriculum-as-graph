## Enquiry questions

1. What is the effect of a stimulus factor on human reaction time, and what does this reveal about nervous system function?

---

## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Nervous System and Reflex Arcs (BI-KS4-C012)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The nervous system consists of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and the peripheral nervous system. Sensory neurons carry electrical impulses from receptors to the CNS; motor neurons carry impulses from CNS to effectors. A reflex arc is a rapid, automatic response pathway: receptor → sensory neuron → relay neuron → motor neuron → effector.

**Teaching guidance:** Draw and annotate a reflex arc diagram. Pupils should be able to trace the pathway of an impulse in both a spinal reflex (e.g., withdrawing from pain) and a cranial reflex (e.g., pupil light reflex). Explain why reflex responses are faster than voluntary responses — they do not pass through conscious areas of the brain. Required Practical: investigate the effect of a factor on human reaction time.

**Key vocabulary:** sensory neuron, motor neuron, relay neuron, receptor, effector, synapse, reflex arc, CNS, peripheral nervous system, impulse, stimulus, response, spinal cord

**Common misconceptions:** Students often draw reflex arcs without the relay neuron in the spinal cord. Students also think reflexes require conscious thought — emphasise that the defining feature of a reflex is that it does not involve the conscious brain. Students confuse effectors (muscles and glands that carry out the response) with receptors (which detect the stimulus).

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that the brain and nerves control the body and that reflexes are fast automatic responses, but cannot draw or describe a reflex arc accurately. | What are the three types of neuron in a reflex arc, and what does each do? | Forgetting the relay neuron in the reflex arc; Confusing effectors (muscles and glands that carry out a response) with receptors (which detect stimuli) |
| **Developing** | Can draw and label a reflex arc diagram, explain why reflexes are faster than voluntary responses, and describe how synapses work using neurotransmitters. | Draw a labelled diagram of the reflex arc for a person touching a hot plate and withdrawing their hand. | Drawing the reflex arc without including synapses between neurons; Showing the pathway going to the brain — reflexes are coordinated by the spinal cord, not the conscious brain |
| **Secure** | Explains synaptic transmission in detail (including neurotransmitter release, diffusion and receptor binding), compares nervous and hormonal communication, and designs reaction time experiments. | Compare nervous and hormonal communication in the body. Give one example of each. | Describing hormones as 'slower' without explaining why (they travel in the blood rather than along dedicated neural pathways); Not mentioning that hormones affect only target cells with specific receptors |
| **Mastery** | Analyses how drugs affect synaptic transmission, evaluates the role of the brain in processing information, and applies understanding of the nervous system to clinical contexts such as anaesthesia and neurological conditions. | Explain how some recreational drugs affect the nervous system at the synapse. Use a specific example. | Describing drug effects vaguely ('it affects the brain') rather than explaining the specific mechanism at the synapse; Confusing agonists (which mimic or enhance neurotransmitter effects) with antagonists (which block them) |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Sensory neurons carry electrical impulses from receptors (e.g., in the skin) to the central nervous system. Relay neurons connect sensory and motor neurons within the spinal cord. Motor neurons carry impulses from the CNS to effectors (muscles or glands).*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Receptor (pain receptor in skin) → sensory neuron → synapse → relay neuron (in spinal cord) → synapse → motor neuron → effector (muscle in arm contracts, pulling hand away). The impulse does not travel to the brain for conscious processing, which is why it is faster than a voluntary response.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Nervous communication uses electrical impulses along neurons. It is fast (milliseconds), short-lived, and targets specific effectors via the neural pathway. Example: the reflex arc when touching something hot. Hormonal communication uses chemical messengers (hormones) transported in the blood. It is slower (seconds to minutes), longer-lasting, and affects target organs with specific receptors. Example: insulin released by the pancreas travels in the blood to the liver and muscle cells to reduce blood glucose. Both systems work together to coordinate body functions.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *SSRI antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine) block the reuptake of serotonin from the synaptic cleft. Normally, after serotonin binds to receptors on the post-synaptic membrane and triggers an impulse, it is reabsorbed by the pre-synaptic neuron (reuptake) and recycled. SSRIs block the transporter proteins that reabsorb serotonin, so it remains in the synaptic cleft for longer, continuing to stimulate the post-synaptic neuron. This increases serotonergic activity in the brain, which can alleviate symptoms of depression. Conversely, substances like curare (used in some anaesthetics) block acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, preventing muscle contraction and causing paralysis. These examples show that drugs can either enhance or inhibit synaptic transmission by acting on different components of the synapse.*

### Secondary concept: Cell Specialisation and Differentiation (BI-KS4-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Multicellular organisms contain many different types of specialised cells, each adapted in structure to perform a specific function. Cell differentiation is the process by which a cell becomes specialised; in most animal cells this is irreversible after early embryonic development, while many plant cells retain the ability to differentiate throughout life.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can name some specialised cells and describe what they look like, but struggles to explain how specific structural features relate to the cell's function. | Describing the shape of a specialised cell without connecting it to function; Confusing the functions of different white blood cells with red blood cells |
| **Developing** | Can explain how multiple structural adaptations of specialised cells relate to their function, and understands that differentiation involves changes in gene expression rather than loss of genes. | Saying the root hair cell has 'lots of mitochondria for energy' without specifying that the energy is needed for active transport of mineral ions; Stating that cells lose genes during differentiation rather than correctly explaining that genes are switched on or off |
| **Secure** | Explains differentiation as a process of selective gene expression, compares differentiation in animals and plants, and evaluates the therapeutic potential and ethical issues of stem cell use. | Saying different cells have 'different DNA' instead of correctly explaining they have the same DNA but different genes expressed; Not distinguishing between totipotent, pluripotent and multipotent stem cells |
| **Mastery** | Critically evaluates the medical applications of stem cell therapy, articulates the scientific and ethical arguments, and applies understanding of differentiation to novel research contexts such as induced pluripotent stem cells. | Presenting only one side of the ethical argument without acknowledging the other; Confusing embryonic stem cells (from blastocysts) with adult stem cells (from bone marrow or other tissues) |

### Secondary concept: Aerobic and Anaerobic Respiration (BI-KS4-C011)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Aerobic respiration uses oxygen to break down glucose completely to carbon dioxide and water, releasing large amounts of ATP energy. Anaerobic respiration occurs without oxygen, producing ATP but with a much lower yield. In animals, anaerobic respiration produces lactic acid; in yeast and plants it produces ethanol and carbon dioxide. Fermentation by yeast has industrial applications in brewing and bread-making.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that respiration releases energy from food and can write the word equation for aerobic respiration, but confuses respiration with breathing. | Using 'respiration' to mean 'breathing' rather than the cellular chemical process; Saying respiration 'produces' energy rather than 'releases' energy from glucose |
| **Developing** | Can write the equations for both aerobic and anaerobic respiration, distinguish their products, and explain when anaerobic respiration occurs, but struggles to explain oxygen debt or the link to exercise. | Confusing anaerobic respiration in humans (produces lactic acid) with anaerobic respiration in yeast (produces ethanol and CO2); Saying anaerobic respiration produces 'no energy' rather than 'much less energy' |
| **Secure** | Explains the relationship between exercise, oxygen demand and anaerobic respiration, describes oxygen debt and its repayment, and designs investigations into respiration rate. | Saying lactic acid is 'removed' without specifying that it is converted back to glucose in the liver or oxidised; Describing oxygen debt as simply 'needing to catch your breath' without explaining the biochemical basis |
| **Mastery** | Compares the biochemistry of aerobic and anaerobic pathways, evaluates the industrial applications of fermentation, and analyses experimental data on respiration rates under different conditions. | Saying the yeast 'died' at 60°C rather than explaining that the enzymes were denatured (some yeast cells may survive but the enzymes are non-functional); Not explaining why denaturation is permanent (disruption of tertiary structure) rather than reversible |

### Secondary concept: Blood Glucose Regulation and Diabetes (BI-KS4-C013)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Blood glucose concentration is monitored and regulated by the pancreas through the hormones insulin and glucagon. When blood glucose is too high, beta cells secrete insulin, causing cells to take up glucose and the liver to convert glucose to glycogen. When blood glucose is too low, alpha cells secrete glucagon, causing glycogen to be broken down to glucose. Type 1 diabetes is caused by autoimmune destruction of beta cells; type 2 is caused by insulin resistance.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that insulin is involved in controlling blood sugar and that diabetes is related to blood sugar problems, but confuses the roles of insulin and glucagon and the two types of diabetes. | Saying insulin 'breaks down' glucose rather than correctly saying it promotes glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis; Confusing insulin (lowers blood glucose) with glucagon (raises blood glucose) |
| **Developing** | Can explain the negative feedback loop involving insulin and glucagon, and can distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes including their causes and treatments. | Saying type 1 is caused by 'eating too much sugar' (it is autoimmune); Confusing the treatments — type 1 requires insulin; type 2 is managed with lifestyle changes first |
| **Secure** | Draws and explains the negative feedback loop for blood glucose regulation, interprets blood glucose data, and evaluates the risk factors for type 2 diabetes. | Describing the feedback loop without using the term 'negative feedback' or explaining why it is called that; Confusing glycogen (the storage molecule) with glucagon (the hormone) |
| **Mastery** | Analyses clinical blood glucose data to diagnose diabetes type, evaluates the public health challenge of type 2 diabetes, and explains the molecular mechanisms of insulin resistance. | Diagnosing diabetes type without considering insulin levels alongside glucose levels; Not explaining the mechanism of insulin resistance at the cellular level (reduced receptor density or impaired signalling) |

### Secondary concept: DNA Structure and Protein Synthesis (BI-KS4-C014)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

DNA is a double helix polymer made of nucleotide monomers, each containing a deoxyribose sugar, a phosphate group and one of four nitrogenous bases (adenine, thymine, cytosine, guanine). Complementary base pairing (A-T, C-G) holds the two strands together. Protein synthesis involves transcription (DNA → mRNA in the nucleus) and translation (mRNA → amino acid sequence at the ribosome), with tRNA molecules carrying specific amino acids.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that DNA carries genetic information and is found in the nucleus, but cannot describe its structure or explain the base pairing rules. | Pairing A with G or C with T instead of the correct complementary pairs; Confusing DNA bases with RNA bases (RNA has uracil instead of thymine) |
| **Developing** | Can describe DNA structure as a double helix of nucleotides with complementary base pairing, and understands that genes code for proteins, but struggles with the details of protein synthesis. | Describing DNA as a single strand rather than a double helix; Saying the bases are joined by 'strong covalent bonds' rather than weak hydrogen bonds (the covalent bonds are in the sugar-phosphate backbone) |
| **Secure** | Explains the process of protein synthesis including transcription and translation, writes complementary DNA and mRNA sequences, and explains how mutations can affect protein structure and function. | Forgetting to substitute uracil (U) for thymine (T) when writing the mRNA sequence; Reading the wrong strand of DNA during transcription (the template strand is read 3' to 5') |
| **Mastery** | Analyses the effects of different types of mutations (substitution, insertion, deletion) on protein structure and function, and evaluates the applications of genetic technology including gene therapy and genetic engineering. | Describing frameshift mutations without explaining that codons are read in non-overlapping triplets from a fixed start point; Stating that all substitution mutations change the protein — many are silent due to the degeneracy of the genetic code |

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** Classification, variation and inheritance are fundamentally about recognising patterns in nature — pupils identify regularities that allow grouping and predict how traits are passed on.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- How would you formalise this pattern mathematically?
- What are the limits of this pattern — where does it break down?
- Could this pattern be an artefact of how the data was collected?
- Does identifying the pattern tell us why it occurs?

**Secondary lens:** Cause and Effect — Evolution and natural selection are causal processes: certain traits cause survival advantages, which causes differential reproduction — tracing this causal chain is the core cognitive demand.

## Session structure: Fair Test

### Fair Test
The classic scientific enquiry: formulating a testable question, making a prediction based on scientific understanding, designing a method that controls variables, collecting and recording data systematically, analysing results, and drawing a conclusion linked back to the original hypothesis.

`question` → `hypothesis` → `method` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `conclusion`

**Assessment:** Structured scientific report including question, hypothesis with reasoning, method with variables identified, results table/graph, and conclusion evaluating whether results support the hypothesis.

**Teacher note:** Use the FAIR TEST template: expect pupils to derive a testable hypothesis from scientific theory and design a rigorous method with appropriate controls, precision, and sample size. Guide analysis using statistical techniques or mathematical modelling where appropriate. Demand critical evaluation of validity, reliability, accuracy, and the extent to which results support or refute the hypothesis.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does your hypothesis follow from the underlying scientific theory?
- How have you ensured sufficient precision, accuracy, and reliability in your method?
- What statistical analysis supports your conclusion?
- To what extent do your results support the hypothesis, and what are the limitations?

## Variables

**Independent:** factor being tested (e.g. practice effect, distraction, hand dominance)
**Dependent:** reaction time (seconds, calculated from ruler drop distance using s = ½gt²)
**Controlled:** same person catching, same ruler, same starting position, same instructions, same time of day

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- ruler (30cm)
- computer-based reaction time test (optional)
- stopwatch
- data recording sheets
- calculator

**Safety notes:** Low risk practical. Ensure pupils do not snatch at the ruler too aggressively. If testing the effect of caffeine, check school policy on consumption of caffeinated drinks by minors and obtain parental consent. Do not use any substances that could impair pupils. (Hazard level: low)

---

## Expected outcome

Reaction time can be measured using the ruler drop test and converted to time using s = ½gt². Pupils investigate a factor (e.g. practice, distraction, dominant vs non-dominant hand) and find that reaction times vary between individuals and conditions. The nervous pathway (stimulus → receptor → sensory neurone → relay neurone → motor neurone → effector) introduces a delay, and factors that interfere with signal processing increase reaction time.

**Recording format:** data table with at least 5 repeats per condition, mean and range calculations, bar chart or scatter graph comparing conditions, statistical analysis (mean, range, anomaly identification)

---

## Enquiry type

### Fair Test
A controlled investigation where one variable is deliberately changed while all others are kept the same, to determine whether the changed variable has an effect on a measured outcome. The gold-standard enquiry type for causal questions in science.

**Question stems:**
- How does [independent variable] affect [dependent variable]?
- Does changing [variable] make a difference to [outcome]?
- What is the relationship between [variable A] and [variable B]?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What will you change? (independent variable)
- What will you measure or observe? (dependent variable)
- What will you keep the same? (controlled variables)
- What do you predict will happen? Why?
- Was your prediction correct? What does the evidence show?

### Pattern Seeking
An enquiry where pupils look for relationships or correlations between variables in situations where it is not possible or appropriate to control all the variables. Data is collected and analysed to determine whether there is a pattern — 'Is there a link between X and Y?' — without necessarily establishing causation.

**Question stems:**
- Is there a pattern between [variable A] and [variable B]?
- Do [things with property X] also tend to [show property Y]?
- Can you put these in order of [property] and see what pattern emerges?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- Is there a pattern between [variable A] and [variable B]?
- What do you notice when you compare [these examples]?
- Can you put these in order? What pattern emerges?
- Why might this pattern exist?
- Does the pattern always hold, or are there exceptions?

## Known misconceptions

### Speed and acceleration confusion
**What pupils may say:** Speed and acceleration are the same thing — a fast object is accelerating.
**Correct explanation:** Speed is how fast an object is moving (distance per unit time). Acceleration is the rate at which speed changes (change in speed per unit time). An object can be moving very fast but not accelerating (constant speed). An object can be moving slowly but accelerating rapidly (just starting to move). A parked car has zero speed and zero acceleration. A car cruising at 70 mph has high speed but zero acceleration.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- A car is travelling at a steady 60 mph on a motorway. Is it accelerating?
- A bicycle starts from rest and speeds up. Is it accelerating? Is it going fast?
- What is the difference between speed and acceleration?

## Why this study matters

The ruler drop test is an accessible, low-cost investigation that generates quantitative data with inherent variability — making it ideal for teaching statistical thinking at GCSE level. Calculating mean and range from repeat measurements, identifying anomalies, and drawing error bars develops the data handling skills that examiners specifically test. The biological context connects the abstract concept of reflex arcs to measurable, personal experience.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils anticipate the drop by watching the tester's hand rather than the ruler — standardise the drop method (e.g. tester says 'ready' but drops at a random time)
2. Only taking one measurement per condition — emphasise the need for at least 5 repeats to calculate a reliable mean
3. Confusing reaction time (voluntary response) with reflex time (involuntary) — the ruler drop tests voluntary response, not a true reflex

## Sensitive content

- Avoid framing faster reaction times as 'better' — individual variation is natural and does not indicate ability or worth
- Be sensitive when comparing individual results publicly — focus on group means rather than singling out individuals
