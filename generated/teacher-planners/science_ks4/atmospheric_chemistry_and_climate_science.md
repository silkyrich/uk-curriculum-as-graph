## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Greenhouse Effect and Climate Change (CH-KS4-C013)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The Earth's atmosphere absorbs infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's surface, re-radiating it in all directions including back towards Earth, maintaining a temperature suitable for life (greenhouse effect). Increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (CO2, methane, water vapour) from human activities enhance the greenhouse effect, leading to global warming and climate change.

**Teaching guidance:** Use temperature vs CO2 concentration graphs from ice core data to show the correlation between atmospheric CO2 and global temperature over hundreds of thousands of years. Discuss the strength of evidence for anthropogenic climate change and why consensus has emerged. Pupils should understand the carbon cycle (links to Biology domain 7) and how burning fossil fuels and deforestation disrupts it. Evaluate mitigation strategies: renewable energy, carbon capture, international agreements (Paris Agreement).

**Key vocabulary:** greenhouse effect, greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, methane, water vapour, global warming, climate change, infrared radiation, fossil fuels, deforestation, carbon cycle, mitigation

**Common misconceptions:** Students confuse the greenhouse effect (necessary natural phenomenon) with the enhanced greenhouse effect (human-caused problem). Students also confuse global warming with climate change — warming is one consequence; climate change includes shifts in rainfall patterns, extreme weather events, sea level rise. Students think the ozone hole causes climate change — these are different atmospheric issues.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that greenhouse gases trap heat and that this is causing global warming, but confuses the greenhouse effect with the ozone hole and cannot explain the mechanism. | Name two greenhouse gases and explain what the greenhouse effect is. | Confusing the greenhouse effect (trapping infrared radiation) with the ozone hole (loss of UV protection); Thinking the greenhouse effect is entirely harmful — it is a natural phenomenon necessary for life; the problem is the enhanced greenhouse effect |
| **Developing** | Can explain the greenhouse mechanism, identify human activities that increase greenhouse gas concentrations, and describe some consequences of climate change. | Explain how burning fossil fuels contributes to climate change. | Saying fossil fuels release 'pollution' generically without specifying CO₂ as the greenhouse gas; Not explaining the mechanism by which CO₂ causes warming (absorption and re-radiation of infrared radiation) |
| **Secure** | Evaluates the evidence for human-caused climate change, describes the evolution of Earth's atmosphere, and explains the carbon cycle in relation to atmospheric CO₂ levels. | Describe how the Earth's atmosphere evolved from its early composition to the present day. | Describing the atmospheric evolution without explaining the role of photosynthesis in increasing O₂ and decreasing CO₂; Not connecting the formation of fossil fuels to the reduction of atmospheric CO₂ |
| **Mastery** | Critically evaluates climate data, analyses the effectiveness of mitigation strategies, and addresses common climate sceptic arguments with scientific evidence. | A climate sceptic argues: 'CO₂ is only 0.04% of the atmosphere, so it cannot possibly have a significant effect on temperature.' Evaluate this claim using scientific evidence. | Dismissing the sceptic claim without explaining the specific scientific mechanism; Not mentioning the amplifying feedback mechanisms that multiply CO₂'s direct warming effect |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Carbon dioxide and methane are greenhouse gases. The greenhouse effect is when these gases in the atmosphere absorb infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's surface and re-radiate it in all directions, including back towards Earth, keeping the planet warm enough to support life.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Burning fossil fuels releases CO₂ that was locked in geological formations for millions of years. This increases the atmospheric CO₂ concentration, enhancing the greenhouse effect. More infrared radiation is absorbed and re-radiated back to Earth, raising the average global temperature. Consequences include: rising sea levels (thermal expansion and ice melt), more frequent extreme weather events, and changes in ecosystem distribution.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *The early atmosphere (~4 billion years ago) was mostly CO₂ with some water vapour and nitrogen, produced by volcanic activity. As the Earth cooled, water vapour condensed to form oceans, which absorbed large amounts of CO₂ (forming carbonate sediments and eventually limestone). Around 2.7 billion years ago, photosynthetic cyanobacteria evolved, producing oxygen and consuming CO₂. Over hundreds of millions of years, O₂ levels rose from near zero to the current 21%, while CO₂ fell from a major component to the current 0.04%. The carbon removed from the atmosphere was locked in fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) and carbonate rocks (limestone). Burning fossil fuels returns this carbon to the atmosphere, reversing millions of years of geological carbon sequestration in a few centuries.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *The claim is incorrect. The effectiveness of CO₂ as a greenhouse gas depends on its molecular properties, not its percentage of the atmosphere. CO₂ molecules absorb infrared radiation at specific wavelengths (primarily 15 µm) that coincide with a significant portion of Earth's outgoing thermal radiation. This absorption is quantifiable using spectroscopy and has been measured since 1859 (Tyndall). Ice core data shows a strong correlation between atmospheric CO₂ concentration and global temperature over 800,000 years. The logarithmic relationship between CO₂ concentration and warming means that even small changes in concentration have measurable effects: the increase from 280 ppm (pre-industrial) to 420 ppm (current) has caused approximately 1.1°C of warming. Furthermore, CO₂ triggers amplifying feedbacks (water vapour feedback, ice-albedo feedback) that multiply its direct warming effect. The scientific consensus (>97% of climate scientists) that human-caused CO₂ emissions are driving global warming is based on multiple independent lines of evidence from physics, chemistry, geology and atmospheric science.*

### Secondary concept: Exothermic and Endothermic Reactions (CH-KS4-C009)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Chemical reactions involve breaking bonds in reactants (endothermic, requires energy) and forming bonds in products (exothermic, releases energy). If more energy is released forming bonds than is required breaking bonds, the overall reaction is exothermic and energy is released to the surroundings (temperature increases). If more energy is required to break bonds than is released forming bonds, the overall reaction is endothermic and energy is absorbed from the surroundings (temperature decreases).

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can give examples of exothermic and endothermic reactions and knows that exothermic reactions release heat, but confuses bond breaking (endothermic) with bond forming (exothermic). | Saying 'breaking bonds releases energy' — breaking bonds always requires energy; Confusing exothermic (energy released, temperature increases) with endothermic (energy absorbed, temperature decreases) |
| **Developing** | Can draw energy level diagrams for exothermic and endothermic reactions, including activation energy, and understands that overall energy change depends on bond breaking versus bond forming. | Drawing the products above the reactants for an exothermic reaction (products should be lower); Forgetting to include the activation energy hump — even exothermic reactions need energy input to start |
| **Secure** | Calculates overall energy changes using bond energy data, designs and interprets calorimetry experiments, and explains why catalysts lower activation energy but do not change the overall energy change. | Subtracting bonds broken from bonds formed instead of the correct way round; Counting the wrong number of bonds (e.g., forgetting there are 4 C-H bonds in CH₄ and 4 O-H bonds in 2H₂O) |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates the accuracy and limitations of bond energy calculations, applies energy change concepts to real-world contexts, and explains Hess's law qualitatively. | Not recognising that bond energies are averages and therefore approximate; Assuming that the calculated value should exactly match the experimental value |

### Secondary concept: Hydrocarbons and Crude Oil (CH-KS4-C012)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Crude oil is a finite resource formed from the remains of ancient marine organisms over millions of years. It consists of a mixture of hydrocarbons (compounds containing only carbon and hydrogen) that are separated by fractional distillation. Longer hydrocarbon chains have stronger intermolecular forces, higher boiling points, greater viscosity and lower flammability. Cracking converts longer, less useful chain molecules into shorter, more useful ones.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that crude oil is a mixture of hydrocarbons and that it is separated by fractional distillation, but cannot explain why different fractions have different boiling points. | Including oxygen in the definition of hydrocarbons; Thinking fractional distillation produces pure compounds rather than mixtures (fractions) |
| **Developing** | Can explain fractional distillation in terms of boiling points and intermolecular forces, describe the properties and uses of different fractions, and explain why cracking is needed. | Saying longer chains have 'stronger bonds' without specifying that these are intermolecular forces, not covalent bonds; Confusing properties: longer chains have higher boiling points, higher viscosity and lower flammability |
| **Secure** | Explains the combustion products of hydrocarbons and their environmental impacts, writes balanced equations for complete and incomplete combustion, and explains the economic importance of cracking. | Not balancing the combustion equations correctly, especially for incomplete combustion; Confusing CO (carbon monoxide, toxic) with CO₂ (carbon dioxide, greenhouse gas) |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates the environmental and economic implications of fossil fuel dependence, compares alternative fuels, and explains the chemistry of polymer formation from alkene monomers produced by cracking. | Presenting hydrogen as automatically 'green' without considering how it is produced; Not comparing hydrogen with battery electric vehicles as competing solutions |

### Secondary concept: Life Cycle Assessment and Sustainable Chemistry (CH-KS4-C014)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Life cycle assessment (LCA) systematically evaluates the environmental impact of a product throughout its entire life: raw material extraction, manufacturing, use, and end-of-life disposal or recycling. LCA provides an evidence base for comparing the sustainability of different materials and processes. Sustainable chemistry (green chemistry) aims to design processes that minimise waste, use renewable feedstocks, use safer solvents and reduce energy consumption.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that recycling is good for the environment and that some resources are finite, but cannot explain the concept of a life cycle assessment or evaluate sustainability systematically. | Confusing finite resources (will run out) with renewable resources (can be replenished); Saying 'all resources are finite' without distinguishing between practical timeframes |
| **Developing** | Can describe the four stages of a life cycle assessment, explain why recycling conserves resources, and describe water treatment for potable water. | Missing one of the four stages (raw materials, manufacture, use, disposal); Not considering energy use and emissions at each stage |
| **Secure** | Compares the LCA of alternative products, evaluates the trade-offs in sustainability decisions, and explains the principles of green chemistry. | Assuming paper is automatically more sustainable than plastic without comparing the full lifecycle; Not considering the number of uses when comparing bag types |
| **Mastery** | Critically evaluates the limitations of LCA, analyses circular economy principles, and applies sustainability thinking to novel materials and processes. | Presenting bioplastics as unambiguously better without acknowledging the trade-offs; Not recognising that LCA methodology choices affect the conclusions |

### Secondary concept: Chemical Analysis and Identification Techniques (CH-KS4-C015)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Chemical analysis involves systematic procedures for identifying unknown substances and assessing the purity of chemical samples. At GCSE, pupils develop proficiency in a range of qualitative analytical techniques: paper chromatography (separating mixture components using a solvent moving through chromatography paper, with Rf values calculated as distance moved by substance divided by distance moved by solvent); flame tests (identifying metal ions by the characteristic colour produced when compounds are heated in a flame); chemical precipitation tests (identifying ions in solution by adding reagents that form characteristic precipitates); and gas tests (identifying common gases by their characteristic reactions with test reagents). These techniques develop practical chemistry skills and the ability to connect observation to chemical knowledge.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can carry out basic chemical tests (e.g., testing a gas with a splint) but does not understand the underlying chemistry or how to approach identification of an unknown systematically. | Confusing the hydrogen test (squeaky pop with lit splint) with the oxygen test (relights a glowing splint); Not specifying that the splint must be lit (not glowing) for the hydrogen test |
| **Developing** | Can carry out and interpret flame tests, gas tests and simple chemical tests for ions, and understands that pure substances have fixed melting and boiling points. | Not cleaning the wire between flame tests, leading to contamination; Forgetting to test the gas produced with limewater — just seeing bubbles does not confirm carbonate |
| **Secure** | Designs systematic identification procedures for unknown substances, calculates and interprets Rf values in chromatography, and explains why each test is specific to the substance it identifies. | Measuring to the edge of the spot rather than the centre; Dividing the solvent front distance by the spot distance instead of the correct way round |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates the limitations of qualitative tests and the advantages of instrumental methods, applies systematic analytical approaches to complex unknowns, and connects analytical chemistry to real-world applications. | Dismissing traditional tests entirely in favour of instrumental methods without acknowledging their practical value; Not connecting analytical methods to specific real-world applications |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Physical phenomena (shadows, circuits, forces) involve clear causal chains: changing one variable produces a predictable effect, making cause-and-effect reasoning the investigative frame.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- Is this a necessary cause, a sufficient cause, or a contributing factor?
- What confounding variables could explain this relationship?
- How would you design an investigation to establish causation, not just correlation?
- In this causal chain, where could an intervention have the most effect?

**Secondary lens:** Energy and Matter — Energy clusters require pupils to trace where energy comes from, how it is transferred or transformed, and where it ends up — conservation and flow are the central ideas.

## Session structure: Secondary Data Analysis

### Secondary Data Analysis
An enquiry using existing published data sets rather than first-hand collection. Pupils frame an enquiry question, select and evaluate appropriate data sources, process and present data using statistical or graphical methods, analyse patterns and anomalies, evaluate reliability, and present findings.

`question_framing` → `data_selection` → `processing` → `analysis` → `evaluation` → `presentation`

**Assessment:** Data analysis report including processed data presented in appropriate formats, statistical analysis where relevant, interpretation of findings, and evaluation of data reliability and limitations.

**Teacher note:** Use the SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS template: expect pupils to independently select, evaluate, and process secondary data using statistical or analytical techniques. Demand critical assessment of data quality, collection methodology, potential biases, and the validity of conclusions drawn from secondary analysis. Guide formal presentation of findings with appropriate acknowledgement of uncertainty.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How would you evaluate the reliability and validity of this secondary dataset?
- What analytical techniques are most appropriate for this data, and why?
- What biases or limitations in the original data collection might affect your conclusions?
- How would you present your findings with appropriate acknowledgement of uncertainty?

## Variables

**Independent:** time period or human activity analysed
**Dependent:** atmospheric CO₂ concentration / global temperature anomaly
**Controlled:** data source consistency, measurement methodology across datasets

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- published datasets (atmospheric CO₂ concentration over time, global temperature records, ice core data)
- graphing software or graph paper
- carbon footprint calculators (online)
- data interpretation worksheets

**Safety notes:** No physical hazards — this is a secondary data analysis enquiry. Ensure pupils use reputable data sources (e.g. NASA, Met Office, IPCC). (Hazard level: low)

---

## Expected outcome

Pupils analyse published data showing the correlation between rising CO₂ levels and global temperature increase. They evaluate the strength of evidence from multiple independent sources (ice cores, satellite data, direct measurements). They calculate and compare carbon footprints for different activities and evaluate strategies for reduction. The analysis leads to an understanding of the difference between correlation and causation, and the role of scientific consensus.

**Recording format:** annotated graphs of CO₂ and temperature data, evaluation of data reliability and limitations, carbon footprint comparison table, evidence-based conclusion on climate change

## Enquiry type

### Research Using Secondary Sources
An enquiry where pupils answer scientific questions using information from books, websites, databases, and other secondary sources rather than first-hand investigation. Used when the question cannot be answered by practical investigation in the classroom (e.g. space, evolution, body systems, historical scientific discoveries).

**Question stems:**
- What does the evidence tell us about [topic]?
- How do scientists explain [phenomenon]?
- What do we know about [topic] and how do we know it?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What question are we trying to answer?
- Where can we find reliable information about this?
- What are the key facts and ideas from this source?
- Do different sources agree? If not, why might they differ?
- What is the answer to our question, based on the evidence?

### Secondary Data Analysis
An enquiry where pupils analyse existing published datasets rather than collecting their own data. Used when data is too large-scale (e.g. population data, climate data), too dangerous, or too time-consuming to collect first-hand. Develops statistical literacy, data interpretation, and critical evaluation of data quality.

**Question stems:**
- What does this data tell us about [topic]?
- Is there a trend in this dataset? What might explain it?
- How reliable is this data? What are its limitations?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What question can this dataset help us answer?
- Where does this data come from? How was it collected?
- What patterns or trends can you see in the data?
- What calculations or graphs would help us analyse this?
- What can we conclude? What are the limitations of this data?

## Why this study matters

Secondary data analysis is the appropriate enquiry type for atmospheric chemistry because the data is collected at global scale over decades — it cannot be replicated in a school laboratory. Analysing real scientific datasets develops critical evaluation skills: pupils must assess data quality, distinguish correlation from causation, and understand why scientific consensus is based on converging evidence from multiple independent sources. This enquiry also develops scientific literacy — the ability to evaluate claims about climate change using evidence rather than opinion.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils confuse weather (short-term) with climate (long-term trends) — use at least 30-year datasets to show trends
2. Treating correlation between CO₂ and temperature as automatically proving causation — discuss the mechanism (greenhouse effect) and converging evidence
3. Pupils may present climate change as a matter of opinion rather than scientific evidence — emphasise the distinction between the science (settled) and policy responses (debated)

## Sensitive content

- Climate change can provoke anxiety in young people — present the science honestly but also discuss mitigation strategies and human agency
- Some families may hold sceptical views — focus on evaluating evidence rather than asserting conclusions, while being clear about scientific consensus
