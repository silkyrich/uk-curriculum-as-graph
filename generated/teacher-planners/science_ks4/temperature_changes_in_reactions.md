---

## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Exothermic and Endothermic Reactions (CH-KS4-C009)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Chemical reactions involve breaking bonds in reactants (endothermic, requires energy) and forming bonds in products (exothermic, releases energy). If more energy is released forming bonds than is required breaking bonds, the overall reaction is exothermic and energy is released to the surroundings (temperature increases). If more energy is required to break bonds than is released forming bonds, the overall reaction is endothermic and energy is absorbed from the surroundings (temperature decreases).

**Teaching guidance:** Required Practical 5: use a polystyrene cup calorimeter to measure temperature changes of neutralisation reactions and combustion reactions. Use energy level diagrams to illustrate exothermic and endothermic reactions, including activation energy. Bond energy calculations (Higher): sum of bonds broken minus sum of bonds formed = overall energy change. Common exothermic reactions: combustion, neutralisation, oxidation. Common endothermic: thermal decomposition, citric acid + sodium bicarbonate.

**Key vocabulary:** exothermic, endothermic, bond energy, activation energy, energy level diagram, enthalpy change, calorimeter, temperature change, bond breaking, bond forming

**Common misconceptions:** Students often say 'exothermic releases energy' without specifying that this energy is released to the surroundings as heat. Students also think that breaking bonds releases energy — breaking bonds always requires energy. The common confusion is that forming bonds (not breaking them) releases energy.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can give examples of exothermic and endothermic reactions and knows that exothermic reactions release heat, but confuses bond breaking (endothermic) with bond forming (exothermic). | Is combustion exothermic or endothermic? How do you know? | Saying 'breaking bonds releases energy' — breaking bonds always requires energy; Confusing exothermic (energy released, temperature increases) with endothermic (energy absorbed, temperature decreases) |
| **Developing** | Can draw energy level diagrams for exothermic and endothermic reactions, including activation energy, and understands that overall energy change depends on bond breaking versus bond forming. | Draw an energy level diagram for an exothermic reaction and label: reactants, products, activation energy, and overall energy change. | Drawing the products above the reactants for an exothermic reaction (products should be lower); Forgetting to include the activation energy hump — even exothermic reactions need energy input to start |
| **Secure** | Calculates overall energy changes using bond energy data, designs and interprets calorimetry experiments, and explains why catalysts lower activation energy but do not change the overall energy change. | Calculate the overall energy change for the combustion of methane: CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O. Bond energies: C-H = 413 kJ/mol, O=O = 498 kJ/mol, C=O = 805 kJ/mol, O-H = 464 kJ/mol. | Subtracting bonds broken from bonds formed instead of the correct way round; Counting the wrong number of bonds (e.g., forgetting there are 4 C-H bonds in CH₄ and 4 O-H bonds in 2H₂O) |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates the accuracy and limitations of bond energy calculations, applies energy change concepts to real-world contexts, and explains Hess's law qualitatively. | Bond energy calculations often give approximate values that differ from experimentally measured enthalpy changes. Explain why. | Not recognising that bond energies are averages and therefore approximate; Assuming that the calculated value should exactly match the experimental value |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Combustion is exothermic. It releases energy to the surroundings as heat and light. You can tell because the temperature of the surroundings increases.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *The diagram shows reactants at a higher energy level than products. An energy 'hump' between them represents the activation energy. The downward arrow from reactants to products represents the overall energy released (negative enthalpy change). The energy released to the surroundings equals the difference between the energy levels of reactants and products.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Bonds broken: 4 × C-H + 2 × O=O = 4(413) + 2(498) = 1652 + 996 = 2648 kJ. Bonds formed: 2 × C=O + 4 × O-H = 2(805) + 4(464) = 1610 + 1856 = 3466 kJ. Overall energy change = energy in (broken) - energy out (formed) = 2648 - 3466 = -818 kJ/mol. The negative value confirms the reaction is exothermic — more energy is released forming new bonds than is required to break the old ones.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Bond energy values used in GCSE calculations are average bond energies — the mean energy required to break a particular type of bond across many different molecules. In reality, the energy of a C-H bond varies depending on the molecular environment: the C-H bond in methane (CH₄) has a slightly different energy from the C-H bond in ethanol (C₂H₅OH) because the surrounding atoms influence electron distribution. Using average values introduces systematic error. Additionally, bond energy calculations assume that all bonds are either completely broken or completely formed, which is a simplification of the transition state. Experimental calorimetry measures the actual enthalpy change for a specific reaction under specific conditions, so it gives more accurate values. However, bond energy calculations are useful for estimating energy changes when experimental data is unavailable.*

### Secondary concept: Ionic Bonding and Giant Ionic Lattices (CH-KS4-C003)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Ionic bonding occurs when metal atoms lose electrons and non-metal atoms gain electrons, forming oppositely charged ions. The ions arrange themselves in a regular lattice held together by strong electrostatic forces of attraction in all directions. Giant ionic compounds have high melting and boiling points, conduct electricity when molten or in aqueous solution (ions free to move) but not when solid.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that ionic compounds are formed from metals and non-metals and involve charged particles, but cannot draw dot-and-cross diagrams or explain why ionic compounds have high melting points. | Saying sodium and chlorine 'share' electrons (that would be covalent bonding); Drawing dot-and-cross diagrams without showing the full electron configuration of each ion |
| **Developing** | Can draw dot-and-cross diagrams for simple ionic compounds and explain their high melting points in terms of strong electrostatic attractions, but struggles with properties of compounds with higher-charged ions. | Drawing the dot-and-cross diagram showing only the outer electrons rather than the complete electron arrangement of the ions; Not explaining that higher charges lead to stronger electrostatic attraction |
| **Secure** | Explains all physical properties of ionic compounds (melting point, conductivity, solubility) in terms of ionic bonding and lattice structure, and can predict properties of unfamiliar ionic compounds. | Saying 'the electrons can move' in dissolved NaCl — it is the ions, not electrons, that carry charge in ionic solutions; Not explaining that conductivity requires charged particles that are free to move |
| **Mastery** | Compares the properties of ionic compounds with different lattice structures, evaluates the limitations of the ionic model, and applies knowledge to predict behaviour in novel contexts. | Saying NaCl dissolves 'because it is ionic' without explaining the role of water's polarity; Not using the energy balance argument (lattice energy vs hydration energy) to explain why some ionic compounds are insoluble |

### Secondary concept: Covalent Bonding and Molecular Structures (CH-KS4-C004)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Covalent bonding occurs when atoms share pairs of electrons to achieve full outer shells. Simple molecular substances consist of small molecules held together by weak intermolecular forces; they have low melting points and do not conduct electricity. Giant covalent structures (diamond, graphite, silicon dioxide) have very high melting points due to many strong covalent bonds throughout the structure. Graphite is unusual in conducting electricity due to delocalised electrons.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that covalent bonding involves sharing electrons and can name some simple covalent molecules, but confuses weak intermolecular forces with strong covalent bonds when explaining properties. | Saying 'water has weak bonds' rather than correctly distinguishing between strong intramolecular bonds and weak intermolecular forces; Thinking the covalent bonds break when water boils |
| **Developing** | Can draw dot-and-cross diagrams for common molecules, compare simple molecular and giant covalent structures, and explain diamond vs graphite properties. | Not mentioning that graphite has delocalised electrons between layers, which explains its electrical conductivity; Saying diamond is hard because of 'strong bonds' without specifying the three-dimensional network structure |
| **Secure** | Explains the properties of all four structure types (simple molecular, giant covalent, ionic, metallic) in terms of bonding and structure, and can predict properties of unfamiliar substances. | Assuming that because both contain covalent bonds, they should have similar properties; Not identifying the structure type as the determining factor for physical properties |
| **Mastery** | Analyses the relationship between molecular shape, polarity and intermolecular forces, evaluates the properties of nanomaterials, and applies bonding models to novel materials. | Describing graphene's properties without linking each property to a specific structural feature; Not explaining why graphene conducts electricity (delocalised electrons from the fourth bonding electron on each carbon) |

### Secondary concept: Moles and Stoichiometry (CH-KS4-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

The mole is the unit of amount of substance; 1 mole of any substance contains 6.02 × 10²³ particles (Avogadro's number). The relative formula mass (Mr) numerically equals the mass in grams of 1 mole. Stoichiometry uses balanced equations to determine the molar ratios of reactants and products, allowing calculation of the mass of any reactant or product if the mass of another is known.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that chemical equations must be balanced and that mass is conserved, but struggles with mole calculations and confuses mass with amount of substance. | Forgetting to multiply the mass of oxygen by 3; Adding atomic numbers instead of atomic masses |
| **Developing** | Can calculate Mr, convert between mass and moles using moles = mass/Mr, and use molar ratios from balanced equations, but makes errors in multi-step calculations. | Using the wrong molar ratio from the balanced equation; Dividing by Mr when they should multiply (or vice versa) in the final step |
| **Secure** | Performs multi-step stoichiometry calculations confidently, including limiting reagent problems and concentration calculations, and can explain the significance of conservation of mass. | Forgetting to convert cm³ to dm³ (divide by 1000); Using a 1:1 ratio instead of the correct 2:1 ratio from the balanced equation |
| **Mastery** | Applies stoichiometry to complex industrial and analytical contexts, evaluates sources of error in quantitative experiments, and uses the ideal gas equation for gas volume calculations. | Confusing precision with accuracy — precise results can be inaccurate if there is systematic error; Not distinguishing between systematic errors (consistent bias) and random errors (scatter around the true value) |

### Secondary concept: Collision Theory and Reaction Rates (CH-KS4-C010)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Chemical reactions occur when reactant particles collide with sufficient energy (equal to or greater than the activation energy) and with correct orientation. Increasing concentration increases the frequency of collisions; increasing temperature increases both the frequency and energy of collisions; increasing surface area increases the frequency of collisions; a catalyst provides an alternative reaction pathway with lower activation energy.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that reactions go faster when heated or when using smaller pieces, but cannot explain why using collision theory. | Only mentioning increased collision frequency without mentioning increased collision energy; Saying particles 'collide harder' without linking this to activation energy |
| **Developing** | Can use collision theory to explain the effect of all five factors (concentration, temperature, surface area, pressure, catalyst) on reaction rate, and can calculate mean rate from experimental data. | Dividing time by volume instead of volume by time; Not including correct units in the answer |
| **Secure** | Interprets rate curves from experimental data, calculates rate at specific points from tangent gradients, and designs controlled experiments to investigate rate factors. | Saying the reaction 'slows down because it runs out of energy' rather than correctly explaining that reactant concentration decreases; Not recognising that the final flat section means the reaction is complete, not just slow |
| **Mastery** | Analyses rate data quantitatively, evaluates the effectiveness of different catalysts, and connects collision theory to industrial process optimisation. | Saying the catalyst increases the yield of ammonia (it does not — it only increases the rate); Not connecting the catalyst's role to the economic viability of the industrial process |

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** Properties can be sorted and classified into patterns (metals conduct, insulators don't), allowing pupils to make predictions about unfamiliar materials.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- How would you formalise this pattern mathematically?
- What are the limits of this pattern — where does it break down?
- Could this pattern be an artefact of how the data was collected?
- Does identifying the pattern tell us why it occurs?

**Secondary lens:** Structure and Function — Material properties link physical structure (molecular arrangement, surface texture) to functional behaviour (waterproofing, strength, flexibility) — the key question is always 'why does this material behave this way?'

## Session structure: Fair Test

### Fair Test
The classic scientific enquiry: formulating a testable question, making a prediction based on scientific understanding, designing a method that controls variables, collecting and recording data systematically, analysing results, and drawing a conclusion linked back to the original hypothesis.

`question` → `hypothesis` → `method` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `conclusion`

**Assessment:** Structured scientific report including question, hypothesis with reasoning, method with variables identified, results table/graph, and conclusion evaluating whether results support the hypothesis.

**Teacher note:** Use the FAIR TEST template: expect pupils to derive a testable hypothesis from scientific theory and design a rigorous method with appropriate controls, precision, and sample size. Guide analysis using statistical techniques or mathematical modelling where appropriate. Demand critical evaluation of validity, reliability, accuracy, and the extent to which results support or refute the hypothesis.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does your hypothesis follow from the underlying scientific theory?
- How have you ensured sufficient precision, accuracy, and reliability in your method?
- What statistical analysis supports your conclusion?
- To what extent do your results support the hypothesis, and what are the limitations?

## Variables

**Independent:** type of reaction (exothermic vs endothermic) or mass/volume of reactant
**Dependent:** temperature change (°C)
**Controlled:** volume of solution, starting temperature, insulation (same calorimeter), concentration of solutions

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- polystyrene cup (calorimeter)
- thermometer (±0.5°C) or temperature probe
- measuring cylinder
- citric acid solution
- sodium hydrogen carbonate powder
- dilute hydrochloric acid
- sodium hydroxide solution
- magnesium ribbon
- balance
- safety goggles
- lid for cup

**Safety notes:** Wear safety goggles throughout. Some reactions produce significant temperature changes — do not touch hot solutions. Magnesium reacts vigorously with acid and produces flammable hydrogen gas — no naked flames nearby. Sodium hydroxide is corrosive. Use a lid on the calorimeter to reduce heat loss but allow gas to escape. Wash splashes immediately. (Hazard level: standard)

---

## Expected outcome

Exothermic reactions (e.g. acid + alkali, acid + metal) increase the temperature of the surroundings. Endothermic reactions (e.g. citric acid + sodium hydrogen carbonate) decrease the temperature. The temperature change can be used to calculate the energy transferred using Q = mcΔT. Comparing experimental values with theoretical bond energy calculations reveals the inefficiency of the simple calorimeter due to heat loss.

**Recording format:** temperature readings before and after reaction, temperature change calculation, energy transferred calculation (Q = mcΔT), energy profile diagram (exothermic vs endothermic)

---

## Enquiry type

### Fair Test
A controlled investigation where one variable is deliberately changed while all others are kept the same, to determine whether the changed variable has an effect on a measured outcome. The gold-standard enquiry type for causal questions in science.

**Question stems:**
- How does [independent variable] affect [dependent variable]?
- Does changing [variable] make a difference to [outcome]?
- What is the relationship between [variable A] and [variable B]?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What will you change? (independent variable)
- What will you measure or observe? (dependent variable)
- What will you keep the same? (controlled variables)
- What do you predict will happen? Why?
- Was your prediction correct? What does the evidence show?

## Known misconceptions

### Energy is used up
**What pupils may say:** Energy is used up when you use it — it gets used up and is gone.
**Correct explanation:** Energy cannot be created or destroyed — it is conserved (the first law of thermodynamics). When we say energy is 'used', we mean it is transferred from one store to another. Often it is transferred to thermal energy in the surroundings, which is less useful but not gone. The total amount of energy before and after any process is always the same.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- When a battery goes flat, where has the energy gone?
- If energy cannot be destroyed, why do we need to keep buying fuel?
- What does 'conservation of energy' mean?

### Cold flows into objects
**What pupils may say:** Cold flows into warm objects — that is why things cool down.
**Correct explanation:** There is no such thing as 'cold' as a form of energy. What happens is that thermal energy transfers from hotter objects to cooler objects. When you touch a cold window, heat transfers from your warm hand to the cold glass — it feels cold because you are losing heat, not because 'cold' is flowing into you. Energy always transfers from hot to cold, never the other way.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- When you hold an ice cube and it feels cold, is cold flowing into your hand or heat flowing out?
- What direction does thermal energy always transfer?
- Why does a metal spoon feel colder than a wooden spoon at the same temperature?

## Why this study matters

This required practical bridges the gap between qualitative understanding (hot = exothermic, cold = endothermic) and quantitative energy calculations using Q = mcΔT. The polystyrene cup calorimeter is deliberately imperfect, which provides an excellent context for evaluation — pupils can discuss heat loss, insulation, and why their experimental value differs from the theoretical value. This evaluation skill is heavily examined at GCSE.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils assume all reactions are exothermic — the endothermic citric acid reaction is counter-intuitive and memorable
2. Forgetting to use the mass of the SOLUTION (not the solid) in Q = mcΔT — the water in the solution is absorbing or releasing the thermal energy
3. Not evaluating why their answer differs from the theoretical value — heat loss to surroundings is the main source of error
