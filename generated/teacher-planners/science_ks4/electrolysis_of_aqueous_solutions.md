## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Electrolysis (CH-KS4-C008)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Electrolysis is the decomposition of an ionic compound using direct current. Positive ions (cations) move to the negative electrode (cathode) and gain electrons (reduction); negative ions (anions) move to the positive electrode (anode) and lose electrons (oxidation). For aqueous solutions, the products depend on the relative positions of the ions in the reactivity series and the concentration of the solution.

**Teaching guidance:** Required Practical 4: investigate the electrolysis of aqueous solutions using inert electrodes. Start with molten ionic compounds (e.g., lead bromide) where prediction is straightforward. For aqueous solutions, introduce the competition between ions: at the cathode, H+ (from water) vs metal ion; at the anode, OH- (from water) vs halide ion. Copper plating provides a good application context. Half equations: e.g., at cathode Cu2+ + 2e- → Cu; at anode 2Cl- → Cl2 + 2e-.

**Key vocabulary:** electrolysis, electrode, cathode, anode, cation, anion, reduction, oxidation, half-equation, molten, aqueous, electrolyte, discharge

**Common misconceptions:** Students mix up cathode and anode: cathode = negative electrode = reduction = cations; anode = positive electrode = oxidation = anions. The mnemonic 'PANOX, CARED' (Positive Anode Oxidation; Cathode Reduction Electrons Discharged) helps. Students also think that electrolysis always decomposes the ionic compound completely, forgetting that water also provides H+ and OH- ions in aqueous solutions.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that electrolysis uses electricity to break down compounds and that it involves electrodes, but confuses which ions go to which electrode and what happens there. | In the electrolysis of molten lead bromide, what forms at each electrode? | Confusing cathode (negative, reduction, cations) with anode (positive, oxidation, anions); Forgetting that the metal always forms at the cathode |
| **Developing** | Can predict the products of electrolysis of molten compounds and write half equations, but struggles with aqueous solutions where water provides competing ions. | Predict the products of electrolysis of molten sodium chloride and write the half equations. | Predicting products for molten compounds correctly but then applying the same rules to aqueous solutions without considering H⁺ and OH⁻ from water; Not balancing electrons in the half equations |
| **Secure** | Predicts products of electrolysis of aqueous solutions using reactivity and concentration rules, writes half equations for all products, and explains the practical applications of electrolysis. | Predict the products of electrolysis of concentrated sodium chloride solution (brine) and dilute sodium chloride solution. Explain the difference. | Not applying the concentration rule at the anode — at low concentration, OH⁻ from water is discharged instead of the halide; Forgetting that at the cathode, hydrogen is produced instead of the metal if the metal is more reactive than hydrogen |
| **Mastery** | Applies electrolysis quantitatively (Faraday's laws), evaluates industrial electrolysis processes, and analyses the economic and environmental trade-offs of electrochemical methods. | The chlor-alkali industry electrolyses brine to produce chlorine, hydrogen and sodium hydroxide. Explain why this process is economically important and evaluate its environmental impact. | Describing the products without explaining their industrial applications and economic value; Not mentioning the evolution from mercury cell to membrane cell technology as an environmental improvement |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *At the cathode (negative electrode): lead metal forms (Pb²⁺ ions gain electrons: Pb²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Pb). At the anode (positive electrode): bromine gas forms (Br⁻ ions lose electrons: 2Br⁻ → Br₂ + 2e⁻).*

> **Model response (Developing):** *At the cathode: sodium metal (Na⁺ + e⁻ → Na). At the anode: chlorine gas (2Cl⁻ → Cl₂ + 2e⁻). In the molten state, Na⁺ and Cl⁻ are the only ions present, so the prediction is straightforward.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Concentrated NaCl solution: cathode = hydrogen gas (H⁺ + e⁻ → ½H₂, because Na is too reactive to be discharged); anode = chlorine gas (2Cl⁻ → Cl₂ + 2e⁻, because Cl⁻ ions are in high concentration). Dilute NaCl solution: cathode = hydrogen (same reason); anode = oxygen gas (4OH⁻ → 2H₂O + O₂ + 4e⁻, because at low Cl⁻ concentration, OH⁻ ions from water are preferentially discharged). The concentration rule applies at the anode: when halide ions are concentrated, they are discharged; when dilute, OH⁻ is discharged instead.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *At the anode: 2Cl⁻ → Cl₂ + 2e⁻ (chlorine, used in water purification, PVC production, and bleach). At the cathode: 2H₂O + 2e⁻ → H₂ + 2OH⁻ (hydrogen for fuel and ammonia production; NaOH remains in solution, used in soap, paper and chemical manufacturing). All three products are industrially valuable, making the process highly efficient economically. Environmental concerns: chlorine is toxic if released; historically, mercury cell technology contaminated water bodies (Minamata disease); modern membrane cell technology has largely eliminated this risk. The process is energy-intensive, so its carbon footprint depends on the electricity source. The products themselves pose environmental risks if mishandled (chlorine gas, caustic soda burns), requiring strict regulatory compliance.*

### Secondary concept: Atomic Structure and Subatomic Particles (CH-KS4-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

An atom consists of a very small, dense, positively charged nucleus containing protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons in shells at relatively large distances. Protons have a mass of 1 and charge of +1; neutrons have a mass of 1 and charge of 0; electrons have negligible mass and charge of -1. The atomic number (proton number) identifies the element; the mass number is the total of protons and neutrons.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can name the three subatomic particles and state that atoms have a nucleus, but confuses their charges and relative masses or cannot use the periodic table to determine particle numbers. | Stating that neutrons have a positive charge; Confusing atomic number (number of protons) with mass number (protons + neutrons) |
| **Developing** | Can use the periodic table to determine the number of protons, neutrons and electrons in an atom, and understands what isotopes are, but struggles with ion electron configurations. | Thinking ions have different numbers of protons from the neutral atom; Subtracting atomic number from mass number the wrong way round |
| **Secure** | Explains the historical development of atomic models with reference to experimental evidence, calculates relative atomic masses from isotope data, and applies the nuclear model to explain ion formation. | Describing the experiment without linking each observation to a specific conclusion about atomic structure; Confusing the Rutherford model (nuclear) with the Bohr model (electron shells) |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates the strengths and limitations of successive atomic models, calculates relative atomic masses from isotope abundance data, and explains why models in science are provisional and subject to revision. | Simply averaging 35 and 37 to get 36 instead of using the weighted calculation; Not explaining why the RAM is an average rather than the mass of any individual atom |

### Secondary concept: Electronic Configuration and Periodic Trends (CH-KS4-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Electrons occupy shells at increasing distances from the nucleus, with the first shell holding up to 2 electrons and subsequent shells holding up to 8. The number of electrons in the outermost shell determines the chemical properties of an element. Elements in the same group have the same number of outer electrons and therefore similar chemical properties. Trends in reactivity, melting point and atomic radius can be explained by electronic configuration.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that elements are arranged in the periodic table and that elements in the same group have similar properties, but cannot explain why using electronic configuration. | Saying they react similarly 'because they are in the same group' without explaining the electronic basis; Writing electronic configurations with too many electrons in inner shells |
| **Developing** | Can write electronic configurations for elements 1-20, explain group and period trends, and predict properties of unfamiliar elements from their position in the periodic table. | Writing the configuration as 2,8,10 instead of 2,8,8,2; Confusing the trend for metals (reactivity increases down the group) with halogens (reactivity decreases down the group) |
| **Secure** | Explains reactivity trends for groups 1, 7 and 0 in terms of atomic structure, predicts properties of elements not studied, and links electronic configuration to bonding behaviour. | Using the group 1 reactivity argument (easier to lose electrons) for group 7 (which gains electrons); Not mentioning shielding by inner electron shells as a factor reducing nuclear attraction |
| **Mastery** | Analyses periodic trends quantitatively using data on ionisation energies and electronegativity, evaluates the limitations of the simple shell model, and explains transition metal properties. | Explaining the trend across a period but not down a group, or vice versa; Not acknowledging that the simple shell model has limitations for explaining anomalies |

### Secondary concept: Ionic Bonding and Giant Ionic Lattices (CH-KS4-C003)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Ionic bonding occurs when metal atoms lose electrons and non-metal atoms gain electrons, forming oppositely charged ions. The ions arrange themselves in a regular lattice held together by strong electrostatic forces of attraction in all directions. Giant ionic compounds have high melting and boiling points, conduct electricity when molten or in aqueous solution (ions free to move) but not when solid.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that ionic compounds are formed from metals and non-metals and involve charged particles, but cannot draw dot-and-cross diagrams or explain why ionic compounds have high melting points. | Saying sodium and chlorine 'share' electrons (that would be covalent bonding); Drawing dot-and-cross diagrams without showing the full electron configuration of each ion |
| **Developing** | Can draw dot-and-cross diagrams for simple ionic compounds and explain their high melting points in terms of strong electrostatic attractions, but struggles with properties of compounds with higher-charged ions. | Drawing the dot-and-cross diagram showing only the outer electrons rather than the complete electron arrangement of the ions; Not explaining that higher charges lead to stronger electrostatic attraction |
| **Secure** | Explains all physical properties of ionic compounds (melting point, conductivity, solubility) in terms of ionic bonding and lattice structure, and can predict properties of unfamiliar ionic compounds. | Saying 'the electrons can move' in dissolved NaCl — it is the ions, not electrons, that carry charge in ionic solutions; Not explaining that conductivity requires charged particles that are free to move |
| **Mastery** | Compares the properties of ionic compounds with different lattice structures, evaluates the limitations of the ionic model, and applies knowledge to predict behaviour in novel contexts. | Saying NaCl dissolves 'because it is ionic' without explaining the role of water's polarity; Not using the energy balance argument (lattice energy vs hydration energy) to explain why some ionic compounds are insoluble |

### Secondary concept: Reactivity Series and Displacement Reactions (CH-KS4-C007)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The reactivity series ranks metals in order of their tendency to react with oxygen, water and acids. A more reactive metal displaces a less reactive metal from a solution of its salt (displacement reaction). Oxidation is loss of electrons and reduction is gain of electrons (OIL RIG); in displacement reactions, the more reactive metal is oxidised and the less reactive metal ion is reduced.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can list some metals in order of reactivity and knows that more reactive metals react more vigorously with acid, but cannot explain reactivity in terms of electron transfer. | Describing the observation without explaining it in terms of electron transfer; Not identifying which species is oxidised and which is reduced |
| **Developing** | Can use the reactivity series to predict displacement reactions, define oxidation and reduction using OIL RIG, and write word equations for metal-acid reactions. | Mixing up OIL RIG: oxidation is loss of electrons, reduction is gain of electrons; Predicting a displacement reaction when the metal is less reactive than the ion in solution |
| **Secure** | Writes balanced ionic and half equations for displacement reactions, explains metal extraction methods using reactivity, and applies redox concepts to electrolysis. | Including spectator ions in the ionic equation; Not balancing the number of electrons in the half equations |
| **Mastery** | Applies redox principles to complex reactions including disproportionation, evaluates the economic and environmental factors in metal extraction, and analyses unfamiliar reactions using oxidation state changes. | Saying aluminium cannot be reduced by carbon without explaining why (its position in the reactivity series); Not mentioning the role of cryolite in reducing the operating temperature and energy costs |

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** Chemistry at KS4 is rich in patterns — periodic table trends, reactivity series, reaction type categories — that allow pupils to predict the behaviour of unfamiliar substances.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- How would you formalise this pattern mathematically?
- What are the limits of this pattern — where does it break down?
- Could this pattern be an artefact of how the data was collected?
- Does identifying the pattern tell us why it occurs?

**Secondary lens:** Cause and Effect — Chemical reactions involve causal mechanisms (electron transfer causes bonding, acid-base reactions follow proton transfer) that explain observed phenomena rather than merely describing them.

---

## Session structure: Pattern Seeking

### Pattern Seeking
Enquiry focused on identifying relationships and regularities in data. Pupils pose questions about possible correlations, gather data through observation or measurement, organise and represent data graphically, identify patterns, and attempt to explain the underlying relationship.

`question` → `data_gathering` → `graphing` → `pattern_identification` → `explanation`

**Assessment:** Data presentation with appropriate graph or chart, written description of the pattern found, and explanation of the possible reasons for the pattern, including evaluation of the strength of evidence.

**Teacher note:** Use the PATTERN SEEKING template: frame an investigation that requires quantitative analysis of relationships between variables. Expect pupils to use appropriate statistical techniques to identify and test patterns, evaluate the strength and significance of correlations, and discuss the limitations of pattern-based reasoning including confounding variables and sampling bias.

**KS4 question stems:**
- What statistical test would you use to evaluate the significance of this pattern?
- What confounding variables might produce a spurious pattern?
- How does the strength of this correlation compare across different conditions?
- What are the limitations of drawing conclusions from pattern-based data alone?

## Variables

**Independent:** aqueous solution used (copper sulfate, sodium chloride, sodium sulfate)
**Dependent:** products formed at each electrode (identified by gas tests and observations)
**Controlled:** voltage, electrode material (graphite), volume of solution, time of electrolysis

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- electrolysis cells or beakers
- carbon (graphite) electrodes
- DC power supply (6V)
- connecting wires with crocodile clips
- copper sulfate solution (0.5M)
- sodium chloride solution (concentrated and dilute)
- sodium sulfate solution
- universal indicator
- wooden splint
- test tubes for gas collection
- safety goggles
- gloves

**Safety notes:** Wear safety goggles and gloves. Electrolysis of sodium chloride produces chlorine gas — work in a fume cupboard or very well ventilated area. Do NOT inhale gases directly — waft cautiously. Use low voltage DC only (max 6V). Avoid short-circuiting the power supply. Copper sulfate solution is harmful — avoid ingestion and wash skin contact immediately. Ensure electrodes are secure and do not touch each other. (Hazard level: elevated)

---

## Expected outcome

At the cathode (negative electrode): metal is deposited if it is less reactive than hydrogen (e.g. copper from copper sulfate); otherwise hydrogen gas is produced (positive splint test: squeaky pop). At the anode (positive electrode): if the solution contains a halide, the halogen is produced (e.g. chlorine from sodium chloride); otherwise oxygen is produced. Pupils predict products using the reactivity series and halide rule, then test predictions experimentally.

**Recording format:** observations table (solution, cathode product, anode product, gas tests), ionic half-equations at each electrode, pattern identification linking products to reactivity series

---

## Enquiry type

### Fair Test
A controlled investigation where one variable is deliberately changed while all others are kept the same, to determine whether the changed variable has an effect on a measured outcome. The gold-standard enquiry type for causal questions in science.

**Question stems:**
- How does [independent variable] affect [dependent variable]?
- Does changing [variable] make a difference to [outcome]?
- What is the relationship between [variable A] and [variable B]?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What will you change? (independent variable)
- What will you measure or observe? (dependent variable)
- What will you keep the same? (controlled variables)
- What do you predict will happen? Why?
- Was your prediction correct? What does the evidence show?

### Pattern Seeking
An enquiry where pupils look for relationships or correlations between variables in situations where it is not possible or appropriate to control all the variables. Data is collected and analysed to determine whether there is a pattern — 'Is there a link between X and Y?' — without necessarily establishing causation.

**Question stems:**
- Is there a pattern between [variable A] and [variable B]?
- Do [things with property X] also tend to [show property Y]?
- Can you put these in order of [property] and see what pattern emerges?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- Is there a pattern between [variable A] and [variable B]?
- What do you notice when you compare [these examples]?
- Can you put these in order? What pattern emerges?
- Why might this pattern exist?
- Does the pattern always hold, or are there exceptions?

## Known misconceptions

### All metals react with acids
**What pupils may say:** All metals react with acids.
**Correct explanation:** Some metals are too unreactive to react with dilute acids. Copper, silver, gold, and platinum do not react with dilute hydrochloric acid because they are below hydrogen in the reactivity series. Only metals above hydrogen (like magnesium, zinc, and iron) react with dilute acids to produce a salt and hydrogen gas. This is why gold jewellery does not dissolve in contact with acidic substances.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- If you put a gold ring in dilute hydrochloric acid, would it dissolve? Why or why not?
- What would you observe if you put copper in dilute acid?
- What determines whether a metal will react with an acid?


---

## Why this study matters

Electrolysis requires pupils to apply multiple chemistry concepts simultaneously: ionic bonding, the reactivity series, oxidation and reduction, and charge transfer. The pattern-seeking element — predicting products before testing — develops higher-order reasoning. Writing ionic half-equations extends mathematical and chemical literacy. The practical produces dramatic, visible results (copper depositing, gases bubbling, indicator colour changes) that make abstract electrochemistry concrete.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils confuse the cathode and anode — use the mnemonic PANIC (Positive Anode, Negative Is Cathode) and reinforce with diagrams
2. Difficulty writing half-equations — practise the pattern: cations gain electrons at cathode (reduction), anions lose electrons at anode (oxidation)
3. Pupils may think electrolysis 'creates' elements — it separates existing ions that were already in the solution

## Sensitive content

- Chlorine gas is toxic — ensure the fume cupboard is functioning and pupils with respiratory conditions are accommodated
