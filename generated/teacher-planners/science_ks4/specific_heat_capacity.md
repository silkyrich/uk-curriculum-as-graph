## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Specific Heat Capacity and Latent Heat (PH-KS4-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Specific heat capacity (c) is the energy required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of a material by 1°C: Q = mcΔT. Different materials require different amounts of energy for the same temperature change, which explains why water is used as a coolant and why land heats up faster than sea. Latent heat is the energy transferred during a change of state at constant temperature; specific latent heat (L) is the energy required per kilogram: Q = mL.

**Teaching guidance:** Required Practical 14: measure the specific heat capacity of water or a metal block using a joulemeter or ammeter and voltmeter. Pupils should calculate the energy transferred electrically and compare with the measured temperature change. Heating and cooling curves (temperature vs time) show the constant temperature during changes of state and reinforce the latent heat concept. Connect to climate science: water's high specific heat capacity moderates coastal climates.

**Key vocabulary:** specific heat capacity, latent heat, specific latent heat, temperature, internal energy, change of state, melting, boiling, evaporation, condensation, joulemeter

**Common misconceptions:** Students confuse temperature (a measure of mean kinetic energy of particles) and internal energy (total energy of all particles). Students think heating always raises temperature — during a change of state, heat is supplied but temperature remains constant. Students also confuse specific heat capacity (energy per kg per degree) with heat capacity (energy per degree).

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Recognises that different materials heat up at different rates and that changes of state require energy input or release without a temperature change. | Explain why a metal spoon feels hotter than a wooden spoon when both are left in hot water for the same time. | Stating the metal 'has more heat' rather than explaining the rate of thermal energy transfer; Confusing temperature with thermal energy — believing a small hot object has more energy than a large warm one |
| **Developing** | Uses the specific heat capacity equation (E = mcΔθ) to calculate energy changes for heating and cooling, and identifies specific latent heat as the energy for a change of state. | Calculate the energy needed to heat 0.5 kg of water from 20°C to 100°C. The specific heat capacity of water is 4200 J/kg°C. | Using the final temperature instead of the temperature change (Δθ) in the equation; Forgetting that during a change of state the temperature remains constant, so SHC equation does not apply |
| **Secure** | Combines SHC and specific latent heat calculations in multi-step problems, interprets heating curves showing plateaus at changes of state, and explains the particle model basis for these energy changes. | Describe and explain the shape of a heating curve for ice at -10°C being heated to steam at 110°C. Include relevant equations. | Not recognising that the gradient differs between solid, liquid, and gas phases because they have different SHC values; Confusing latent heat of fusion with latent heat of vaporisation or using the wrong value in calculations |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates experimental methods for determining SHC and latent heat, analyses sources of systematic error, and applies combined calculations to unfamiliar engineering or environmental contexts. | In a school experiment to determine the SHC of aluminium, a 1 kg block is heated with a 50 W immersion heater for 300 s. The temperature rises from 20°C to 53.3°C. Calculate the experimental SHC and explain why this differs from the accepted value of 900 J/kg°C. | Stating the experimental value is 'wrong' without identifying the direction and cause of systematic error; Not recognising that energy losses always make the experimental SHC appear lower than the true value |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Metal conducts heat quickly so thermal energy transfers from the water to your hand faster. Wood is an insulator so it transfers heat more slowly.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *E = mcΔθ = 0.5 × 4200 × (100 - 20) = 0.5 × 4200 × 80 = 168,000 J = 168 kJ.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *The curve has five sections: (1) rising temperature as ice heats (E = mcΔθ using SHC of ice), (2) flat plateau at 0°C as ice melts (E = mL using specific latent heat of fusion), (3) rising temperature as water heats (E = mcΔθ using SHC of water), (4) flat plateau at 100°C as water boils (E = mL using specific latent heat of vaporisation), (5) rising temperature as steam heats. During plateaus, energy overcomes intermolecular bonds rather than increasing kinetic energy of particles.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Energy supplied = Pt = 50 × 300 = 15,000 J. SHC = E/(mΔθ) = 15,000/(1 × 33.3) = 450 J/kg°C. This is lower than 900 J/kg°C because the calculation assumes all electrical energy heats the block, but energy is lost to the surroundings by radiation and conduction. The true temperature rise should be smaller, giving a higher SHC. Insulating the block, using a lid, and applying thermal paste between heater and block would reduce systematic error.*

### Secondary concept: Energy Stores and Transfers (PH-KS4-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Energy is stored in physical systems in various ways: kinetic (moving objects), gravitational potential (objects above a reference level), elastic potential (deformed objects), chemical (fuels, food), thermal (hot objects), nuclear (unstable nuclei), electromagnetic (electric/magnetic fields). Energy is neither created nor destroyed (conservation of energy) but transferred between stores by mechanical work, electrical work, heating or radiation. Useful energy transfers are always accompanied by dissipation to the thermal store of the surroundings.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Identifies basic energy stores (kinetic, thermal, gravitational potential) and recognises that energy can be transferred between stores. | Describing energy as being 'used up' or 'created' rather than transferred between stores; Confusing energy stores with energy transfer pathways (e.g. saying 'sound energy store') |
| **Developing** | Describes energy transfers using correct store terminology, calculates kinetic and gravitational potential energy using standard formulae, and recognises conservation of energy. | Forgetting to state the assumption about negligible air resistance when equating GPE to KE; Using incorrect units or confusing mass in kg with weight in N in the GPE formula |
| **Secure** | Applies energy conservation quantitatively across multi-step problems, calculates efficiency, and draws and interprets Sankey diagrams for real systems. | Drawing Sankey diagram arrows that do not conserve total width (input width must equal sum of output widths); Confusing power (rate of energy transfer) with total energy transferred when calculating efficiency |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates energy transfer scenarios critically, combines power, work done, and efficiency in extended calculations, and analyses the limitations of energy models in real-world contexts. | Failing to identify multiple dissipation pathways and only listing one source of energy loss; Not linking the impossibility of 100% recovery to fundamental thermodynamic principles |

### Secondary concept: Current, Potential Difference and Resistance (PH-KS4-C003)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Electric current (I) is the rate of flow of electric charge: I = Q/t. Potential difference (V) is the work done per unit charge: V = W/Q. Resistance (R) is the ratio of potential difference to current: R = V/I (Ohm's law). For an ohmic conductor at constant temperature, resistance is constant. Resistance of a filament bulb increases with temperature; a thermistor's resistance decreases with temperature; a diode allows current in one direction only.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Identifies current as the flow of charge, potential difference as the push on charges, and resistance as opposition to flow. Draws and recognises simple series and parallel circuits. | Drawing the voltmeter in series with the lamp rather than in parallel across it; Confusing the circuit symbols for ammeter (A in circle) and voltmeter (V in circle) |
| **Developing** | Applies V = IR to calculate current, p.d., or resistance. Describes how current and p.d. behave in series and parallel circuits. Interprets I-V characteristic graphs for resistors, filament lamps, and diodes. | Using individual resistance instead of total resistance to calculate the current from the supply; Forgetting that in a series circuit, the p.d.s across components must sum to the supply p.d. |
| **Secure** | Analyses combined series-parallel circuits, explains non-ohmic behaviour using particle models (filament lamp, thermistor, LDR, diode), and applies the charge equation Q = It alongside V = IR. | Confusing the p.d. across the thermistor with the p.d. across the fixed resistor; Not explaining that the thermistor's resistance decreases with temperature due to more charge carriers being released |
| **Mastery** | Designs and evaluates circuits for specific purposes, analyses experimental I-V data critically, and explains the physics underlying component behaviour at a particle level, including energy transfers within circuits. | Failing to distinguish between 'current increases with voltage' and 'current is directly proportional to voltage'; Not linking the curvature of the I-V graph to the physical mechanism of increased lattice vibrations at higher temperatures |

### Secondary concept: Electrical Power and Mains Electricity (PH-KS4-C004)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Electrical power is the rate at which energy is transferred: P = IV = I²R = V²/R. Energy transferred is calculated using E = Pt. Mains electricity in the UK is supplied as alternating current at 230 V and 50 Hz. The three-pin plug contains a live wire (brown), neutral wire (blue) and earth wire (green-yellow). The fuse protects the appliance by melting if the current becomes too large; the earth wire provides safety in case of a fault.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Recognises that electrical appliances transfer energy, knows the difference between a.c. and d.c., and identifies basic electrical safety features (fuses, earth wires, insulation). | Stating that a.c. is 'stronger' than d.c. rather than describing the directional difference; Not knowing the UK mains supply values (230 V, 50 Hz) |
| **Developing** | Calculates electrical power using P = IV and P = I²R, determines energy transferred using E = Pt, and explains how fuses and circuit breakers protect circuits from overheating. | Selecting a fuse with exactly the same rating as the operating current rather than the next size up; Using the wrong power equation and mixing up variables |
| **Secure** | Applies the National Grid model to explain efficient power transmission, uses P = IV and P = I²R to explain why high voltage reduces energy losses, and calculates energy costs using the kilowatt-hour. | Stating 'high voltage means less energy lost' without explaining the mechanism via reduced current and I²R; Confusing the transmitted power with the wasted power in the cables |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates the efficiency and safety trade-offs in real electrical systems, analyses energy cost scenarios with multiple appliances, and critically discusses the advantages and limitations of different generation and distribution methods. | Not understanding that COP > 1 is possible because a heat pump moves existing thermal energy rather than creating it; Failing to evaluate real-world limitations such as seasonal COP variation and installation costs |

### Secondary concept: Particle Model, Density and Gas Laws (PH-KS4-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The particle model describes matter as composed of tiny particles in constant motion. In solids, particles vibrate about fixed positions; in liquids, particles can flow but remain in contact; in gases, particles move rapidly and are widely separated. Density (ρ = m/V) depends on particle mass and separation. Gas pressure is caused by particles colliding with the container walls. Increasing temperature increases the kinetic energy and speed of particles, increasing the rate and force of collisions.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Describes the particle arrangements in solids, liquids, and gases, and relates these to macroscopic properties such as shape, volume, and compressibility. | Drawing gas particles as stationary or evenly spaced rather than randomly distributed and moving; Stating that particles 'expand' when heated rather than that they move faster and spread further apart |
| **Developing** | Calculates density using ρ = m/V, describes how temperature relates to average kinetic energy of particles, and explains pressure in gases using particle collisions with container walls. | Failing to convert cm³ to m³ correctly (1 m³ = 1,000,000 cm³, not 100 cm³); Mixing grams and kilograms without converting, giving an answer out by a factor of 1000 |
| **Secure** | Applies the gas laws (pV = constant at constant T; p/T = constant at constant V) to solve problems, links gas pressure to particle kinetic energy and collision frequency, and explains density differences between states using the particle model. | Stating that particles 'move faster' when compressed at constant temperature — speed is unchanged, only collision frequency increases; Applying Boyle's law to situations where temperature changes, invalidating the constant-temperature assumption |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates the limitations of the simple particle model, applies gas law calculations to unfamiliar contexts, and analyses experimental methods for measuring density of regular and irregular objects including sources of error. | Not identifying that trapped air bubbles systematically increase volume and therefore decrease the density calculation; Confusing systematic errors (air bubbles, porous stone) with random errors (reading the meniscus) in evaluation |

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** Sorting, classifying and identifying similarities directly trains pupils to recognise regularities and use them to predict or generalise.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- How would you formalise this pattern mathematically?
- What are the limits of this pattern — where does it break down?
- Could this pattern be an artefact of how the data was collected?
- Does identifying the pattern tell us why it occurs?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Drawing conclusions from observations requires constructing a claim supported by specific evidence — not just describing what was seen.

---

## Session structure: Fair Test

### Fair Test
The classic scientific enquiry: formulating a testable question, making a prediction based on scientific understanding, designing a method that controls variables, collecting and recording data systematically, analysing results, and drawing a conclusion linked back to the original hypothesis.

`question` → `hypothesis` → `method` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `conclusion`

**Assessment:** Structured scientific report including question, hypothesis with reasoning, method with variables identified, results table/graph, and conclusion evaluating whether results support the hypothesis.

**Teacher note:** Use the FAIR TEST template: expect pupils to derive a testable hypothesis from scientific theory and design a rigorous method with appropriate controls, precision, and sample size. Guide analysis using statistical techniques or mathematical modelling where appropriate. Demand critical evaluation of validity, reliability, accuracy, and the extent to which results support or refute the hypothesis.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does your hypothesis follow from the underlying scientific theory?
- How have you ensured sufficient precision, accuracy, and reliability in your method?
- What statistical analysis supports your conclusion?
- To what extent do your results support the hypothesis, and what are the limitations?

## Variables

**Independent:** energy supplied to the block (via heating time or joulemeter reading)
**Dependent:** temperature rise of the metal block (°C)
**Controlled:** mass of block, starting temperature, voltage, insulation

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- metal block (aluminium, with two holes for heater and thermometer)
- immersion heater (12V)
- thermometer or temperature probe
- joulemeter or ammeter + voltmeter + stopwatch
- power supply (12V DC)
- insulation (lagging)
- electronic balance
- connecting wires

**Safety notes:** The metal block gets hot — do not touch with bare hands; use insulation or allow to cool before handling. The immersion heater must be fully inserted into the block before switching on. Do not run the heater dry. Keep water away from electrical equipment. Check connections before switching on to avoid short circuits. (Hazard level: standard)

---

## Expected outcome

Energy supplied (E = VIt or read from joulemeter) raises the temperature of the metal block. Using ΔE = mcΔθ, pupils calculate the specific heat capacity. The experimental value will be higher than the accepted value because energy is lost to the surroundings. Evaluating this discrepancy — and suggesting how insulation reduces it — is a key assessment focus.

**Recording format:** data table of time, temperature, voltage, current (or joulemeter readings), temperature-time graph, SHC calculation with full working, evaluation of sources of error and percentage difference from accepted value

---

## Enquiry type

### Fair Test
A controlled investigation where one variable is deliberately changed while all others are kept the same, to determine whether the changed variable has an effect on a measured outcome. The gold-standard enquiry type for causal questions in science.

**Question stems:**
- How does [independent variable] affect [dependent variable]?
- Does changing [variable] make a difference to [outcome]?
- What is the relationship between [variable A] and [variable B]?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What will you change? (independent variable)
- What will you measure or observe? (dependent variable)
- What will you keep the same? (controlled variables)
- What do you predict will happen? Why?
- Was your prediction correct? What does the evidence show?

## Known misconceptions

### Heating always raises temperature
**What pupils may say:** Temperature always increases when you heat something.
**Correct explanation:** During a change of state (melting or boiling), the temperature remains constant even though energy is being added. The energy is being used to break the bonds between particles (changing their arrangement) rather than increasing their kinetic energy (which would raise the temperature). This is why a heating curve has flat sections at the melting point and boiling point.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- What happens to the temperature of ice when it is melting? Does it keep going up?
- If you keep heating water at 100C, what happens to the temperature? What happens to the water?
- Where is the energy going during a change of state if the temperature is not increasing?

### Energy is used up
**What pupils may say:** Energy is used up when you use it — it gets used up and is gone.
**Correct explanation:** Energy cannot be created or destroyed — it is conserved (the first law of thermodynamics). When we say energy is 'used', we mean it is transferred from one store to another. Often it is transferred to thermal energy in the surroundings, which is less useful but not gone. The total amount of energy before and after any process is always the same.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- When a battery goes flat, where has the energy gone?
- If energy cannot be destroyed, why do we need to keep buying fuel?
- What does 'conservation of energy' mean?

### Cold flows into objects
**What pupils may say:** Cold flows into warm objects — that is why things cool down.
**Correct explanation:** There is no such thing as 'cold' as a form of energy. What happens is that thermal energy transfers from hotter objects to cooler objects. When you touch a cold window, heat transfers from your warm hand to the cold glass — it feels cold because you are losing heat, not because 'cold' is flowing into you. Energy always transfers from hot to cold, never the other way.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- When you hold an ice cube and it feels cold, is cold flowing into your hand or heat flowing out?
- What direction does thermal energy always transfer?
- Why does a metal spoon feel colder than a wooden spoon at the same temperature?

## Why this study matters

This required practical is one of the most quantitatively demanding at GCSE because pupils must combine electrical measurements (V, I, t) with thermal measurements (m, Δθ) in a single calculation. The inevitable discrepancy between experimental and accepted values provides an authentic context for error analysis — pupils must identify heat loss as the main source of systematic error and suggest improvements (better insulation, starting below room temperature and finishing above by the same amount). This evaluation skill is worth significant marks in exams.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils forget to convert mass to kilograms — SHC uses SI units throughout (J, kg, °C)
2. Not insulating the block — significant heat loss to surroundings inflates the calculated SHC
3. Pupils do not understand why their value is 'wrong' — the experimental value is not wrong, it includes systematic error from heat loss; discussing this IS the learning
