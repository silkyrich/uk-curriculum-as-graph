---

## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Pathogens and Communicable Disease (BI-KS4-C008)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Pathogens are microorganisms that cause infectious disease. The four types of pathogen are viruses, bacteria, fungi and protists, each with distinct mechanisms of causing harm. Viruses reproduce inside host cells and may destroy them; bacteria may produce toxins; fungi may damage tissues; protists may damage cells directly. Diseases spread through water, air, direct contact, sexual contact, vectors and contaminated food.

**Teaching guidance:** Use specific examples: influenza and HIV (viral), tuberculosis and salmonella (bacterial), rose black spot (fungal), malaria (protist). For each, require pupils to know the specific mechanism of disease and transmission route. Evaluate evidence for the effectiveness of hygiene measures, vaccinations and treatments. This is an excellent context for socio-scientific reasoning about public health policy.

**Key vocabulary:** pathogen, bacterium, virus, fungus, protist, vector, transmission, infection, malaria, Plasmodium, tuberculosis, influenza, HIV, toxin, host

**Common misconceptions:** Students think antibiotics kill viruses — this is one of the most important misconceptions to address. Antibiotics act on bacterial structures not present in viruses. Students also confuse being 'infected' with being 'ill' — the immune system may destroy a pathogen before symptoms develop.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that germs cause disease and that there are different types, but confuses viruses and bacteria and does not know specific examples of pathogens and the diseases they cause. | Name one disease caused by a virus and one caused by a bacterium. | Thinking antibiotics can treat viral infections; Confusing the terms 'bacteria' and 'virus' or using them interchangeably |
| **Developing** | Can name examples of viral, bacterial, fungal and protist diseases, describe their transmission routes, and explain basic body defence mechanisms. | Describe how malaria is transmitted and explain why it is difficult to control in tropical countries. | Saying malaria is caused by mosquitoes rather than by the Plasmodium protist (mosquitoes are the vector, not the pathogen); Describing malaria as a bacterial or viral disease |
| **Secure** | Explains how each type of pathogen causes disease mechanistically, compares transmission routes, and evaluates prevention strategies including hygiene measures and public health interventions. | Compare how viruses and bacteria cause disease at the cellular level. | Saying viruses 'attack' cells without explaining the mechanism of invasion, replication and lysis; Not linking the mechanism of disease to why different treatments are needed |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates the global challenge of antibiotic resistance, analyses epidemiological data on disease transmission, and assesses the scientific evidence for public health interventions including drug development and clinical trials. | Explain why antibiotic resistance is considered one of the greatest threats to global health. What role does natural selection play? | Saying antibiotics 'cause' resistance rather than correctly explaining that antibiotics select for pre-existing resistant variants; Describing resistance as if individual bacteria 'learn' to resist antibiotics rather than explaining population-level natural selection |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Influenza (flu) is caused by a virus. Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by a bacterium.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Malaria is caused by a protist called Plasmodium, which is transmitted by the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes (the vector). When the mosquito bites, it injects Plasmodium into the blood. It is difficult to control because: the mosquitoes breed in standing water which is abundant in tropical regions; insecticide resistance is developing in mosquito populations; and the Plasmodium parasite has a complex life cycle that makes vaccine development challenging.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Viruses are not cells and cannot reproduce independently. They invade host cells and use the cell's machinery to make copies of themselves. The host cell is typically destroyed when new virus particles burst out (lysis), which causes tissue damage and symptoms. Bacteria are living cells that reproduce rapidly by binary fission outside host cells. They cause disease primarily by producing toxins that damage tissues and trigger immune responses. For example, Salmonella bacteria produce toxins that cause inflammation of the gut lining, leading to diarrhoea and vomiting. This mechanistic difference explains why antibiotics work against bacteria (they target bacterial cell structures like cell walls or ribosomes) but not against viruses (which use host cell machinery that antibiotics cannot target without harming the patient).*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Antibiotic resistance occurs through natural selection. Within any bacterial population, random mutations may produce individuals with resistance to a particular antibiotic. When the antibiotic is used, susceptible bacteria are killed but resistant individuals survive and reproduce, passing the resistance allele to offspring. Over time, the proportion of resistant bacteria in the population increases. This is accelerated by overuse and misuse of antibiotics (incomplete courses, use in agriculture). The result is that infections become untreatable with existing antibiotics — MRSA, for example, is resistant to methicillin and other common antibiotics. The WHO estimates that by 2050, antibiotic-resistant infections could cause 10 million deaths annually. Solutions require both scientific approaches (developing new antibiotics, using bacteriophages, developing rapid diagnostic tests) and behavioural changes (prescribing antibiotics only when necessary, completing full courses, reducing agricultural antibiotic use).*

### Secondary concept: Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic Cell Structure (BI-KS4-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Eukaryotic cells (animals, plants, fungi) have a membrane-bound nucleus and extensive internal membrane systems including the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Prokaryotic cells (bacteria) lack a nucleus, with DNA as a single circular loop in the cytoplasm, and may contain plasmids. Prokaryotes also lack mitochondria and chloroplasts.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can name the main parts of animal and plant cells but confuses which structures are present in prokaryotic versus eukaryotic cells, and struggles with scale and microscopy calculations. | Stating that bacterial cells have no DNA rather than correctly saying they have no membrane-bound nucleus; Claiming all plant cells have chloroplasts, forgetting that root cells do not |
| **Developing** | Can accurately describe the key structural differences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells and explain the function of each organelle, but struggles to apply this knowledge to microscopy calculations or unfamiliar contexts. | Forgetting to convert between mm and µm in magnification calculations; Confusing magnification with resolution — magnification makes things bigger, resolution makes them clearer |
| **Secure** | Explains the structural and functional differences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells with accuracy, performs magnification calculations confidently, and applies knowledge to interpret electron micrographs of unfamiliar cells. | Assuming any cell with a cell wall must be a plant cell, forgetting that fungi and bacteria also have cell walls; Not considering that plant cells in non-green tissues lack chloroplasts |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates how the structural differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells relate to their evolutionary origins (endosymbiosis), applies subcellular knowledge to novel contexts, and critically assesses the limitations of different microscopy techniques. | Stating the theory without providing specific structural or genetic evidence to support it; Confusing endosymbiosis (a symbiotic relationship that became permanent) with parasitism |

### Secondary concept: Mitosis and the Cell Cycle (BI-KS4-C003)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The cell cycle is the series of events leading to cell division. DNA is replicated during interphase, after which mitosis produces two genetically identical daughter cells, each with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. Mitosis is used for growth, repair of tissues and asexual reproduction.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that cells divide to produce new cells for growth, but confuses mitosis with meiosis and cannot accurately describe the stages of the cell cycle. | Saying mitosis produces four cells (confusing it with meiosis); Forgetting that DNA replication occurs during interphase before mitosis begins |
| **Developing** | Can describe the cell cycle including interphase, mitosis and cytokinesis, and distinguishes mitosis from meiosis, but makes errors when describing the stages of mitosis in detail. | Describing DNA replication as happening during mitosis rather than during interphase; Not mentioning that chromosomes condense and become visible during prophase |
| **Secure** | Accurately describes all stages of mitosis (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase), explains the significance of the cell cycle for organisms, and connects uncontrolled cell division to cancer. | Stating that cells in interphase are 'resting' — interphase is metabolically active, involving DNA replication and protein synthesis; Not linking the observation to the relative duration of each phase |
| **Mastery** | Analyses data from cell biology experiments, evaluates the role of checkpoints in the cell cycle, and explains how disruption of cell cycle control leads to cancer at a molecular level. | Describing cancer as caused by a single gene mutation rather than explaining the multi-hit model; Confusing tumour suppressor genes (which inhibit cell division) with oncogenes (which promote it) |

### Secondary concept: Immune System and Vaccination (BI-KS4-C009)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The immune system responds to pathogens through phagocytosis (non-specific) and antibody production (specific). Lymphocytes produce antibodies complementary to antigens on the pathogen surface. Memory cells persist after infection, enabling a rapid secondary response. Vaccination introduces antigens to stimulate an immune response without causing disease, producing immunity.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that the body fights disease and that vaccinations help prevent illness, but cannot explain the specific immune response or how vaccination works at a cellular level. | Saying vaccines contain the 'actual disease' rather than dead/weakened pathogens or antigens; Not distinguishing between the primary and secondary immune response |
| **Developing** | Can describe the non-specific and specific immune responses, explain the role of white blood cells, and outline how vaccination produces immunity through memory cells. | Confusing antigens (molecules on the pathogen surface) with antibodies (proteins produced by lymphocytes); Describing phagocytes as 'eating' pathogens without mentioning engulfment and digestion |
| **Secure** | Explains the primary and secondary immune response with reference to memory cells, interprets antibody response graphs, and evaluates the benefits and risks of vaccination programmes. | Drawing the second response with the same height and speed as the first, rather than showing it is faster and higher; Not explaining that memory cells are the mechanism for the faster secondary response |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates the science behind herd immunity thresholds, analyses arguments in vaccination debates using evidence, and explains advanced concepts such as monoclonal antibodies and their medical applications. | Confusing monoclonal antibodies (identical antibodies from cloned hybridoma cells) with polyclonal antibodies (mixture of antibodies from different B cells); Describing the hybridoma technique without explaining why both the B cell and the tumour cell are needed |

### Secondary concept: Evolution by Natural Selection (BI-KS4-C016)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Evolution by natural selection occurs when: there is variation within a population; some of that variation is heritable; individuals compete for limited resources; individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce; advantageous alleles become more common in the population over generations. Speciation occurs when populations become reproductively isolated and evolve independently.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that living things change over time and that Darwin proposed natural selection, but describes evolution as organisms 'choosing' to adapt rather than as a population-level process. | Saying giraffes 'stretched their necks' and passed this on (Lamarckism, not Darwinism); Describing evolution as if individual organisms change rather than populations changing over generations |
| **Developing** | Can state the four conditions for natural selection (variation, heritability, competition, differential survival) and give examples, but struggles to construct a complete natural selection argument for unfamiliar examples. | Saying the antibiotic 'causes' the mutation rather than correctly saying it selects for pre-existing mutations; Describing this as something other than natural selection (it is a clear, rapid example of natural selection in action) |
| **Secure** | Constructs complete natural selection arguments for unfamiliar examples, explains the evidence for evolution from multiple sources, and explains how speciation occurs through reproductive isolation. | Describing adaptation within a population without explaining how reproductive isolation leads to speciation; Not emphasising that speciation requires that the populations can no longer interbreed |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates the evidence for evolution critically, compares natural selection with genetic drift, and analyses how evolutionary theory informs modern biology and medicine. | Listing the evidence without evaluating the relative strength of each type; Not acknowledging limitations of each evidence type (e.g., fossil record is incomplete) |

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** Classification, variation and inheritance are fundamentally about recognising patterns in nature — pupils identify regularities that allow grouping and predict how traits are passed on.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- How would you formalise this pattern mathematically?
- What are the limits of this pattern — where does it break down?
- Could this pattern be an artefact of how the data was collected?
- Does identifying the pattern tell us why it occurs?

**Secondary lens:** Cause and Effect — Evolution and natural selection are causal processes: certain traits cause survival advantages, which causes differential reproduction — tracing this causal chain is the core cognitive demand.

## Session structure: Fair Test

### Fair Test
The classic scientific enquiry: formulating a testable question, making a prediction based on scientific understanding, designing a method that controls variables, collecting and recording data systematically, analysing results, and drawing a conclusion linked back to the original hypothesis.

`question` → `hypothesis` → `method` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `conclusion`

**Assessment:** Structured scientific report including question, hypothesis with reasoning, method with variables identified, results table/graph, and conclusion evaluating whether results support the hypothesis.

**Teacher note:** Use the FAIR TEST template: expect pupils to derive a testable hypothesis from scientific theory and design a rigorous method with appropriate controls, precision, and sample size. Guide analysis using statistical techniques or mathematical modelling where appropriate. Demand critical evaluation of validity, reliability, accuracy, and the extent to which results support or refute the hypothesis.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does your hypothesis follow from the underlying scientific theory?
- How have you ensured sufficient precision, accuracy, and reliability in your method?
- What statistical analysis supports your conclusion?
- To what extent do your results support the hypothesis, and what are the limitations?

## Variables

**Independent:** type or concentration of antiseptic
**Dependent:** area of zone of inhibition (mm²)
**Controlled:** volume of antiseptic on each disc, size of filter paper disc, type and concentration of bacterial culture, incubation temperature and time, same agar plate preparation

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- nutrient agar plates (pre-poured)
- bacterial culture (non-pathogenic, e.g. E. coli K-12)
- filter paper discs
- antiseptic solutions (different concentrations or types)
- sterile forceps
- Bunsen burner
- marker pen
- ruler (mm)
- incubator (25°C maximum in schools)
- autoclave tape

**Safety notes:** Strict aseptic technique throughout: flame the inoculating loop, sterilise the neck of bottles, work near a Bunsen burner. Incubate at a maximum of 25°C in schools (not 37°C) to prevent growth of human pathogens. Do NOT open Petri dishes after incubation. Seal plates with two strips of tape (not fully sealed, to allow aerobic conditions). Autoclave or disinfect all plates before disposal. Wash hands with antibacterial soap before and after the practical. (Hazard level: standard)

---

## Expected outcome

Antiseptics produce clear zones of inhibition around the filter paper discs where bacteria cannot grow. More effective antiseptics produce larger zones. Pupils calculate the area of the zone of inhibition using πr². A control disc (soaked in sterile water) shows no zone, confirming it is the antiseptic, not the disc, that prevents growth.

**Recording format:** data table of zone diameters for each antiseptic, zone of inhibition area calculation (πr²), bar chart comparing effectiveness of antiseptics

---

## Enquiry type

### Fair Test
A controlled investigation where one variable is deliberately changed while all others are kept the same, to determine whether the changed variable has an effect on a measured outcome. The gold-standard enquiry type for causal questions in science.

**Question stems:**
- How does [independent variable] affect [dependent variable]?
- Does changing [variable] make a difference to [outcome]?
- What is the relationship between [variable A] and [variable B]?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What will you change? (independent variable)
- What will you measure or observe? (dependent variable)
- What will you keep the same? (controlled variables)
- What do you predict will happen? Why?
- Was your prediction correct? What does the evidence show?

### Observation Over Time
A systematic enquiry where changes are observed and recorded at intervals over a period of time — hours, days, weeks, or longer. Used when the process being studied is too slow for a single lesson or when the pattern only emerges through repeated observation. Develops patience, systematic recording, and the ability to identify trends.

**Question stems:**
- How does [thing being observed] change over time?
- What happens to [variable] over [time period]?
- What pattern can you see in how [process] changes?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What do you think will happen over time? Why?
- How often should we observe and record?
- What exactly will we look for or measure each time?
- What pattern can you see in the observations?
- Can you explain why this pattern happens?

## Known misconceptions

### Animal cells have no structure
**What pupils may say:** Animal cells do not have any structure — they are just blobs of jelly.
**Correct explanation:** Animal cells have a well-defined internal structure including: a cell membrane (controls what enters and leaves), cytoplasm (where chemical reactions occur), a nucleus (contains DNA and controls the cell), mitochondria (where respiration releases energy), and ribosomes (where proteins are made). What animal cells lack compared to plant cells is a cell wall, chloroplasts, and a large permanent vacuole.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- What structures would you find inside an animal cell?
- What does the nucleus do?
- What is the difference between a cell membrane and a cell wall?


---

## Why this study matters

This required practical is one of the few opportunities for pupils to work with living microorganisms. The aseptic technique develops essential laboratory discipline, while measuring zones of inhibition and calculating areas using πr² integrates mathematical skills with biological concepts. Comparing antiseptic effectiveness introduces the idea of evidence-based medicine and connects to real-world applications of microbiology.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils measure the diameter of the zone including the disc — the zone of inhibition is the clear area around the disc, not including the disc itself
2. Poor aseptic technique leads to contaminated plates — demonstrate each step explicitly before pupils begin
3. Pupils may think all bacteria are harmful — emphasise that most bacteria are harmless or beneficial and only pathogens cause disease

## Sensitive content

- Some pupils may be anxious about handling bacteria — reassure them that school strains are non-pathogenic and aseptic technique provides protection
- Antibiotic resistance is a sensitive current affairs topic — present the science objectively without causing undue alarm
