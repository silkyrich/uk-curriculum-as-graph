## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Newton's Laws of Motion (PH-KS4-C008)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Newton's first law: an object remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by a resultant force. Newton's second law: the resultant force on an object equals its mass times its acceleration (F = ma); the acceleration is in the direction of the resultant force. Newton's third law: when object A exerts a force on object B, object B exerts an equal and opposite force on object A (action-reaction pairs).

**Teaching guidance:** Required Practical 20: investigate the effect of varying force and mass on acceleration. Pupils should be able to draw free body diagrams showing all forces on an object and determine the resultant force. Emphasise that Newton's third law pairs are always the same type of force (e.g., both gravitational, both contact) acting on different objects. Terminal velocity is important: as speed increases, drag increases until drag equals driving force (resultant force = 0, constant velocity). Use velocity-time graphs to analyse forces during acceleration and terminal velocity phases.

**Key vocabulary:** resultant force, Newton's first law, Newton's second law, Newton's third law, acceleration, mass, inertia, free body diagram, terminal velocity, drag, friction, reaction force

**Common misconceptions:** Students often state Newton's third law pairs as forces on the same object (e.g., 'weight and normal reaction are a Newton's third law pair'). These forces are equal and opposite but are NOT a Newton's third law pair because they act on the same object. Newton's third law pairs always act on different objects. Students also think that a stationary object has no forces acting on it — it has balanced forces (zero resultant).

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Describes Newton's three laws qualitatively: objects remain at rest or constant velocity unless acted on by a force, force causes acceleration, and every action has an equal and opposite reaction. | A book is resting on a table. Use Newton's first law to explain why it stays still. | Stating the action-reaction pair is weight and normal force (these act on the same object — not a Newton's third law pair); Believing that an object at rest has no forces acting on it, rather than recognising balanced forces |
| **Developing** | Applies F = ma to calculate force, mass, or acceleration. Draws and interprets free body diagrams showing all forces on an object. Uses Newton's third law to identify action-reaction force pairs acting on different objects. | A 1500 kg car accelerates from rest to 15 m/s in 10 seconds. Calculate the resultant force, assuming constant acceleration. | Forgetting to calculate acceleration first and trying to use F = mv instead of F = ma; Not distinguishing between the driving force (from the engine) and the resultant force (driving force minus friction and air resistance) |
| **Secure** | Applies Newton's laws to multi-force problems including friction, air resistance, and terminal velocity. Interprets velocity-time graphs to determine acceleration and resultant force. Analyses the forces during real scenarios such as skydiving and braking. | Describe and explain the motion of a skydiver from jumping out of the plane until landing, using Newton's laws and a velocity-time graph. | Stating that air resistance is constant rather than velocity-dependent; Drawing the v-t graph with a sharp corner at terminal velocity rather than a smooth curve approaching the plateau |
| **Mastery** | Applies Newton's laws to complex and unfamiliar situations, evaluates the assumptions in simplified models, resolves forces on inclined planes, and analyses real-world applications including vehicle safety and space travel. | A 50 kg skier descends a 30° slope. The coefficient of friction is 0.1. Calculate the acceleration down the slope and evaluate whether the assumption of constant friction is valid at high speed. | Using mg instead of mg cos θ for the normal reaction force on an inclined plane; Forgetting to include air resistance as an additional force that becomes significant at higher speeds |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *The book stays still because the forces on it are balanced. The weight (gravity pulling down) is equal to the normal contact force from the table pushing up. Since the resultant force is zero, the book remains at rest, as Newton's first law states.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Acceleration = Δv/t = (15 - 0)/10 = 1.5 m/s². Resultant force = ma = 1500 × 1.5 = 2250 N.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Initially, only weight acts downward so the skydiver accelerates at g (≈10 m/s²). As speed increases, air resistance increases (proportional to velocity²), reducing the resultant downward force and hence the acceleration. When air resistance equals weight, the resultant force is zero and the skydiver reaches terminal velocity (Newton's first law). On deploying the parachute, air resistance suddenly exceeds weight, creating an upward resultant force that decelerates the skydiver (Newton's second law). Speed decreases, reducing air resistance, until a new lower terminal velocity is reached. The v-t graph shows increasing gradient initially, then decreasing gradient to a plateau, then a sharp decrease to a lower plateau.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Component of weight along slope = mg sin30° = 50 × 10 × 0.5 = 250 N. Normal reaction = mg cos30° = 50 × 10 × 0.866 = 433 N. Friction = μR = 0.1 × 433 = 43.3 N. Resultant force down slope = 250 - 43.3 = 206.7 N. Acceleration = F/m = 206.7/50 = 4.13 m/s². The constant friction model is a simplification. At higher speeds, air resistance becomes significant and should be included as an additional retarding force. The coefficient of friction may also vary with speed — snow compaction and meltwater lubrication change with pressure and temperature. A more complete model would include a velocity-dependent drag term.*

### Secondary concept: Energy Stores and Transfers (PH-KS4-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Energy is stored in physical systems in various ways: kinetic (moving objects), gravitational potential (objects above a reference level), elastic potential (deformed objects), chemical (fuels, food), thermal (hot objects), nuclear (unstable nuclei), electromagnetic (electric/magnetic fields). Energy is neither created nor destroyed (conservation of energy) but transferred between stores by mechanical work, electrical work, heating or radiation. Useful energy transfers are always accompanied by dissipation to the thermal store of the surroundings.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Identifies basic energy stores (kinetic, thermal, gravitational potential) and recognises that energy can be transferred between stores. | Describing energy as being 'used up' or 'created' rather than transferred between stores; Confusing energy stores with energy transfer pathways (e.g. saying 'sound energy store') |
| **Developing** | Describes energy transfers using correct store terminology, calculates kinetic and gravitational potential energy using standard formulae, and recognises conservation of energy. | Forgetting to state the assumption about negligible air resistance when equating GPE to KE; Using incorrect units or confusing mass in kg with weight in N in the GPE formula |
| **Secure** | Applies energy conservation quantitatively across multi-step problems, calculates efficiency, and draws and interprets Sankey diagrams for real systems. | Drawing Sankey diagram arrows that do not conserve total width (input width must equal sum of output widths); Confusing power (rate of energy transfer) with total energy transferred when calculating efficiency |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates energy transfer scenarios critically, combines power, work done, and efficiency in extended calculations, and analyses the limitations of energy models in real-world contexts. | Failing to identify multiple dissipation pathways and only listing one source of energy loss; Not linking the impossibility of 100% recovery to fundamental thermodynamic principles |

### Secondary concept: Current, Potential Difference and Resistance (PH-KS4-C003)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Electric current (I) is the rate of flow of electric charge: I = Q/t. Potential difference (V) is the work done per unit charge: V = W/Q. Resistance (R) is the ratio of potential difference to current: R = V/I (Ohm's law). For an ohmic conductor at constant temperature, resistance is constant. Resistance of a filament bulb increases with temperature; a thermistor's resistance decreases with temperature; a diode allows current in one direction only.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Identifies current as the flow of charge, potential difference as the push on charges, and resistance as opposition to flow. Draws and recognises simple series and parallel circuits. | Drawing the voltmeter in series with the lamp rather than in parallel across it; Confusing the circuit symbols for ammeter (A in circle) and voltmeter (V in circle) |
| **Developing** | Applies V = IR to calculate current, p.d., or resistance. Describes how current and p.d. behave in series and parallel circuits. Interprets I-V characteristic graphs for resistors, filament lamps, and diodes. | Using individual resistance instead of total resistance to calculate the current from the supply; Forgetting that in a series circuit, the p.d.s across components must sum to the supply p.d. |
| **Secure** | Analyses combined series-parallel circuits, explains non-ohmic behaviour using particle models (filament lamp, thermistor, LDR, diode), and applies the charge equation Q = It alongside V = IR. | Confusing the p.d. across the thermistor with the p.d. across the fixed resistor; Not explaining that the thermistor's resistance decreases with temperature due to more charge carriers being released |
| **Mastery** | Designs and evaluates circuits for specific purposes, analyses experimental I-V data critically, and explains the physics underlying component behaviour at a particle level, including energy transfers within circuits. | Failing to distinguish between 'current increases with voltage' and 'current is directly proportional to voltage'; Not linking the curvature of the I-V graph to the physical mechanism of increased lattice vibrations at higher temperatures |

### Secondary concept: Particle Model, Density and Gas Laws (PH-KS4-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The particle model describes matter as composed of tiny particles in constant motion. In solids, particles vibrate about fixed positions; in liquids, particles can flow but remain in contact; in gases, particles move rapidly and are widely separated. Density (ρ = m/V) depends on particle mass and separation. Gas pressure is caused by particles colliding with the container walls. Increasing temperature increases the kinetic energy and speed of particles, increasing the rate and force of collisions.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Describes the particle arrangements in solids, liquids, and gases, and relates these to macroscopic properties such as shape, volume, and compressibility. | Drawing gas particles as stationary or evenly spaced rather than randomly distributed and moving; Stating that particles 'expand' when heated rather than that they move faster and spread further apart |
| **Developing** | Calculates density using ρ = m/V, describes how temperature relates to average kinetic energy of particles, and explains pressure in gases using particle collisions with container walls. | Failing to convert cm³ to m³ correctly (1 m³ = 1,000,000 cm³, not 100 cm³); Mixing grams and kilograms without converting, giving an answer out by a factor of 1000 |
| **Secure** | Applies the gas laws (pV = constant at constant T; p/T = constant at constant V) to solve problems, links gas pressure to particle kinetic energy and collision frequency, and explains density differences between states using the particle model. | Stating that particles 'move faster' when compressed at constant temperature — speed is unchanged, only collision frequency increases; Applying Boyle's law to situations where temperature changes, invalidating the constant-temperature assumption |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates the limitations of the simple particle model, applies gas law calculations to unfamiliar contexts, and analyses experimental methods for measuring density of regular and irregular objects including sources of error. | Not identifying that trapped air bubbles systematically increase volume and therefore decrease the density calculation; Confusing systematic errors (air bubbles, porous stone) with random errors (reading the meniscus) in evaluation |

### Secondary concept: Momentum and Impulse (PH-KS4-C009)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Momentum is the product of mass and velocity: p = mv. The total momentum of a system is conserved in any interaction where no external forces act (conservation of momentum). A force acting on an object changes its momentum: F = Δp/Δt (Newton's second law in terms of momentum). Impulse (FΔt) equals the change in momentum (Δp). Applying a force over a longer time to achieve the same change in momentum reduces the peak force (the principle behind safety features such as airbags and crumple zones).

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Recognises that momentum is related to both mass and velocity, and that collisions involve a transfer of momentum between objects. | Stating momentum depends only on speed without considering mass; Confusing momentum with kinetic energy |
| **Developing** | Calculates momentum using p = mv, applies the conservation of momentum to simple collisions and explosions, and determines the velocity of objects after a collision. | Forgetting to add the masses together for objects that stick together after collision; Not assigning correct signs to velocities when objects move in opposite directions |
| **Secure** | Applies conservation of momentum to two-dimensional collision and explosion problems, links force to rate of change of momentum (F = Δp/Δt), and explains how crumple zones and airbags reduce injury by extending the time of momentum change. | Stating the airbag 'absorbs momentum' rather than correctly explaining it increases the time over which momentum changes; Confusing force (instantaneous) with impulse (force × time = change in momentum) |
| **Mastery** | Analyses complex momentum problems involving elastic and inelastic collisions, evaluates whether kinetic energy is conserved alongside momentum, and applies impulse-momentum relationships to real engineering and safety scenarios. | Forgetting to use signed velocities for objects moving in opposite directions; Confusing conservation of momentum (always conserved in a closed system) with conservation of kinetic energy (only conserved in elastic collisions) |

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** Sorting, classifying and identifying similarities directly trains pupils to recognise regularities and use them to predict or generalise.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- How would you formalise this pattern mathematically?
- What are the limits of this pattern — where does it break down?
- Could this pattern be an artefact of how the data was collected?
- Does identifying the pattern tell us why it occurs?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Drawing conclusions from observations requires constructing a claim supported by specific evidence — not just describing what was seen.

---

## Session structure: Fair Test

### Fair Test
The classic scientific enquiry: formulating a testable question, making a prediction based on scientific understanding, designing a method that controls variables, collecting and recording data systematically, analysing results, and drawing a conclusion linked back to the original hypothesis.

`question` → `hypothesis` → `method` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `conclusion`

**Assessment:** Structured scientific report including question, hypothesis with reasoning, method with variables identified, results table/graph, and conclusion evaluating whether results support the hypothesis.

**Teacher note:** Use the FAIR TEST template: expect pupils to derive a testable hypothesis from scientific theory and design a rigorous method with appropriate controls, precision, and sample size. Guide analysis using statistical techniques or mathematical modelling where appropriate. Demand critical evaluation of validity, reliability, accuracy, and the extent to which results support or refute the hypothesis.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does your hypothesis follow from the underlying scientific theory?
- How have you ensured sufficient precision, accuracy, and reliability in your method?
- What statistical analysis supports your conclusion?
- To what extent do your results support the hypothesis, and what are the limitations?

## Variables

**Independent:** force applied to the spring (weight of masses, F = mg)
**Dependent:** extension of the spring (cm or mm)
**Controlled:** same spring, same starting length, same measurement technique, masses added gently (no bouncing)

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- spring (known spring constant, or unknown for investigation)
- clamp stand, boss and clamp
- ruler with mm divisions
- mass hanger and slotted masses (100g increments)
- pointer attached to spring
- safety goggles
- soft landing surface below spring

**Safety notes:** Wear safety goggles — springs can detach or break under excessive load. Place a soft surface (foam mat) below the apparatus to catch falling masses. Do not exceed the elastic limit of the spring. Stand to one side when loading masses in case the spring breaks. Ensure the clamp stand is stable and weighted at the base. (Hazard level: low)

---

## Expected outcome

Extension is directly proportional to force up to the limit of proportionality — F = ke where k is the spring constant (N/m). The graph of force vs extension is a straight line through the origin in the proportional region. Beyond the limit of proportionality, the graph curves and the spring is permanently deformed. The spring constant k equals the gradient of the straight portion. Elastic potential energy Ee = ½ke² can be calculated for any extension.

**Recording format:** data table of mass, force (F=mg), total length, and extension, graph of force vs extension with limit of proportionality marked, gradient calculation for spring constant, elastic PE calculation

## Enquiry type

### Fair Test
A controlled investigation where one variable is deliberately changed while all others are kept the same, to determine whether the changed variable has an effect on a measured outcome. The gold-standard enquiry type for causal questions in science.

**Question stems:**
- How does [independent variable] affect [dependent variable]?
- Does changing [variable] make a difference to [outcome]?
- What is the relationship between [variable A] and [variable B]?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What will you change? (independent variable)
- What will you measure or observe? (dependent variable)
- What will you keep the same? (controlled variables)
- What do you predict will happen? Why?
- Was your prediction correct? What does the evidence show?

## Known misconceptions

### Constant force needed for constant speed
**What pupils may say:** An object needs a constant force to keep moving at constant speed.
**Correct explanation:** An object moving at constant speed has balanced forces acting on it — the driving force equals the resistive forces (friction, air resistance). No net force is needed to maintain constant velocity. This is Newton's first law: an object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion at constant velocity, unless acted on by an unbalanced force. The confusion arises because on Earth, friction is always present, so we need to push to overcome it — but the push balances friction, it does not cause the motion.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- If you push a box at constant speed across the floor, what forces are acting on it?
- In space with no friction, if you give an object a push and let go, what happens?
- Does a car engine create the force that makes it go, or the force that overcomes friction?

## Why this study matters

Hooke's law produces the clearest proportional relationship in GCSE physics and is the foundation for understanding elastic potential energy. The investigation naturally reveals the limit of proportionality — the point where the graph deviates from a straight line — which teaches pupils that mathematical models have domains of validity. Calculating the spring constant from the gradient connects practical measurement to mathematical analysis. The energy stored (½ke²) extends the investigation into the energy topic, making this a highly interconnected practical.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils measure total length rather than extension — extension = stretched length minus natural length; set up a clear reference point
2. Adding masses too quickly or dropping them, causing the spring to bounce — masses must be added gently and allowed to settle before reading
3. Pupils assume the straight line continues forever — the limit of proportionality is a critical concept; beyond it, the spring is permanently deformed
