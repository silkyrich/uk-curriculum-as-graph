---

## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Ecosystems and Interdependence (BI-KS4-C017)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

An ecosystem is the interaction of a community of organisms with their abiotic (non-living) environment. Organisms within an ecosystem compete for limited resources and depend on each other through feeding relationships, pollination, seed dispersal and decomposition. Producers form the base of food chains; energy is transferred through trophic levels but with significant losses at each stage.

**Teaching guidance:** Required Practical 9: use quadrats and transects to sample the distribution and abundance of organisms. Pupils should be able to construct food chains and webs from data, calculate efficiency of energy transfer between trophic levels, and explain why food chains rarely have more than five trophic levels. Discuss keystone species and how the removal of one species can cascade through an ecosystem.

**Key vocabulary:** ecosystem, community, population, abiotic, biotic, producer, consumer, decomposer, food chain, food web, trophic level, energy transfer, efficiency, keystone species, quadrat, transect

**Common misconceptions:** Students think producers make 'food' from nothing — clarify that producers use light energy and inorganic molecules (CO2, water, minerals) to make organic molecules. Students also think energy is recycled through food chains — energy flows in one direction and is lost as heat; only matter is recycled.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can name organisms in a food chain and describe simple feeding relationships, but confuses producers, consumers and decomposers and cannot explain energy transfer between trophic levels. | What is the difference between a producer and a consumer? Give an example of each. | Saying producers 'make food from nothing' rather than from light energy, CO2 and water; Confusing primary consumers (herbivores) with secondary consumers (carnivores that eat herbivores) |
| **Developing** | Can construct food chains and webs from data, explain trophic levels, and describe how populations affect each other, but struggles with energy transfer calculations and sampling techniques. | In a food chain: grass → rabbit → fox, explain why there are fewer foxes than rabbits. | Saying energy is 'lost' without specifying that it is transferred to the thermal store of the surroundings (heat); Thinking that energy is recycled through food chains (energy flows in one direction; only matter is recycled) |
| **Secure** | Calculates energy transfer efficiency between trophic levels, uses quadrats and transects to estimate population size, and explains the carbon and water cycles. | A student uses quadrats to estimate the population of daisies in a school field measuring 200 m². They place 10 quadrats (each 0.25 m²) randomly and count: 5, 3, 7, 4, 6, 2, 5, 4, 6, 3. Estimate the total population. | Dividing total area by the number of quadrats rather than by the area of one quadrat; Not placing quadrats randomly, which introduces sampling bias |
| **Mastery** | Analyses complex ecological data, evaluates the impact of removing a species from a food web, and uses pyramid diagrams and energy budgets to model ecosystem energy flow. | In a grassland ecosystem, gross primary productivity is 20,000 kJ/m²/year. Plants use 12,000 kJ for respiration. Primary consumers assimilate 1,200 kJ and use 960 kJ for respiration. Calculate the net primary productivity and the efficiency of energy transfer to primary consumers. | Confusing GPP (total energy fixed by photosynthesis) with NPP (energy available after plant respiration); Calculating efficiency using GPP as the denominator rather than NPP |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *A producer makes its own food using photosynthesis, e.g., grass. A consumer cannot make its own food and must eat other organisms, e.g., a rabbit (primary consumer) eats grass.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Energy is lost at each trophic level. Rabbits use most of the energy from eating grass for their own life processes (movement, body heat, excretion), so only about 10% of the energy is passed on to the fox when it eats the rabbit. This means less energy is available to support foxes, so the population is smaller.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Mean number of daisies per quadrat = (5+3+7+4+6+2+5+4+6+3) / 10 = 45/10 = 4.5. Total area of field = 200 m². Area of one quadrat = 0.25 m². Estimated population = mean per quadrat × (total area / quadrat area) = 4.5 × (200 / 0.25) = 4.5 × 800 = 3,600 daisies.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Net primary productivity (NPP) = Gross primary productivity (GPP) - respiration = 20,000 - 12,000 = 8,000 kJ/m²/year. This is the energy available to the primary consumers. Energy transfer efficiency = energy assimilated by primary consumers / NPP × 100 = 1,200 / 8,000 × 100 = 15%. Of the energy assimilated by primary consumers, 960 kJ is used for respiration, leaving only 240 kJ available for secondary consumers. The low efficiency (15%) explains why food chains are short: after 4-5 transfers, insufficient energy remains to support another trophic level.*

### Secondary concept: Transpiration and Plant Transport (BI-KS4-C007)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Water is absorbed by root hair cells and transported up the plant through xylem vessels by the process of transpiration. Dissolved sugars produced in photosynthesis are transported through phloem vessels by translocation. Transpiration rate is affected by light intensity, temperature, humidity, wind speed and the size and distribution of stomata.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that plants need water and that water travels up the stem, but cannot explain the mechanism of transpiration or distinguish xylem from phloem. | Confusing xylem (water, upward) with phloem (sugars, both directions); Saying phloem transports 'food' rather than specifying dissolved sugars |
| **Developing** | Can explain transpiration as the evaporation and diffusion of water from leaves, describe the transpiration stream, and name the factors that affect transpiration rate. | Describing the movement of water up the xylem as 'pumping' rather than as a passive pull driven by evaporation; Forgetting to mention that xylem vessels are dead and hollow — these structural features explain how they function as pipes |
| **Secure** | Explains the mechanism and factors affecting transpiration quantitatively, interprets potometer data, and compares the structure and function of xylem and phloem in detail. | Measuring water uptake with a potometer but describing the measurement as 'transpiration rate' without acknowledging that some absorbed water is used for photosynthesis; Not explaining why the shoot must be cut underwater (to prevent air locks in the xylem) |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates the adaptations of xerophytes and hydrophytes in terms of transpiration control, analyses translocation through phloem using evidence from aphid experiments and radioactive tracers, and connects plant transport to agricultural applications. | Confusing phloem sieve plates (perforated end walls allowing sap flow) with xylem being described as having 'no end walls'; Not distinguishing between the passive transpiration stream in xylem and the energy-requiring translocation in phloem |

### Secondary concept: Photosynthesis (BI-KS4-C010)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Photosynthesis is an endothermic reaction in which light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll and used to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. The glucose produced is used for respiration, converted to starch for storage, used to synthesise cellulose for cell walls, or used to make other biological molecules.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that plants make food using light and can state the word equation for photosynthesis, but confuses photosynthesis with respiration and cannot explain limiting factors. | Writing 'oxygen + glucose → carbon dioxide + water' (this is respiration, not photosynthesis); Forgetting to include light energy as a requirement |
| **Developing** | Can write and balance the symbol equation for photosynthesis, explain that it is endothermic, and name the three main limiting factors but struggles to interpret limiting factor graphs. | Saying the rate 'stops' at high light intensity rather than correctly saying it 'levels off' (photosynthesis continues, just not faster); Not identifying which specific factor is likely to become limiting when light is no longer limiting |
| **Secure** | Interprets and draws limiting factor graphs, designs investigations into factors affecting photosynthesis rate, and explains how glucose produced by photosynthesis is used by the plant. | Using distance from the lamp rather than 1/d² as the measure of light intensity; Not adding sodium hydrogen carbonate to ensure CO2 is not limiting |
| **Mastery** | Analyses complex limiting factor data with multiple variables, evaluates the commercial applications of photosynthesis knowledge in greenhouses and agriculture, and explains the biochemistry of photosynthesis at an introductory level. | Recommending 'maximum' temperature and light without explaining that beyond an optimum, higher values become counterproductive; Not considering the economic dimension — the scientifically optimal conditions may not be economically viable |

### Secondary concept: Evolution by Natural Selection (BI-KS4-C016)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Evolution by natural selection occurs when: there is variation within a population; some of that variation is heritable; individuals compete for limited resources; individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce; advantageous alleles become more common in the population over generations. Speciation occurs when populations become reproductively isolated and evolve independently.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that living things change over time and that Darwin proposed natural selection, but describes evolution as organisms 'choosing' to adapt rather than as a population-level process. | Saying giraffes 'stretched their necks' and passed this on (Lamarckism, not Darwinism); Describing evolution as if individual organisms change rather than populations changing over generations |
| **Developing** | Can state the four conditions for natural selection (variation, heritability, competition, differential survival) and give examples, but struggles to construct a complete natural selection argument for unfamiliar examples. | Saying the antibiotic 'causes' the mutation rather than correctly saying it selects for pre-existing mutations; Describing this as something other than natural selection (it is a clear, rapid example of natural selection in action) |
| **Secure** | Constructs complete natural selection arguments for unfamiliar examples, explains the evidence for evolution from multiple sources, and explains how speciation occurs through reproductive isolation. | Describing adaptation within a population without explaining how reproductive isolation leads to speciation; Not emphasising that speciation requires that the populations can no longer interbreed |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates the evidence for evolution critically, compares natural selection with genetic drift, and analyses how evolutionary theory informs modern biology and medicine. | Listing the evidence without evaluating the relative strength of each type; Not acknowledging limitations of each evidence type (e.g., fossil record is incomplete) |

### Secondary concept: Biodiversity and Human Impact (BI-KS4-C018)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Biodiversity refers to the variety of life in an area, including the number of different species (species richness) and the genetic diversity within species. Human activities threaten biodiversity through habitat destruction, pollution, introduction of invasive species, overexploitation and climate change. Conservation programmes aim to maintain biodiversity and restore damaged ecosystems.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that human activities harm the environment and that some species are endangered, but provides only general statements without specific mechanisms or data. | Listing threats to biodiversity without explaining the mechanism by which they cause harm; Equating biodiversity with the number of individual animals rather than the variety of species and genetic diversity |
| **Developing** | Can explain specific mechanisms by which human activities reduce biodiversity and describe conservation strategies, but struggles to evaluate the effectiveness of different approaches. | Describing conservation strategies without explaining how they specifically address the threats to biodiversity; Not mentioning habitat fragmentation as a consequence of deforestation separate from outright habitat loss |
| **Secure** | Evaluates the effectiveness of conservation programmes, interprets data on species decline, and explains the scientific and economic arguments for maintaining biodiversity. | Presenting captive breeding as either entirely positive or entirely negative without balancing the evaluation; Not connecting captive breeding to the broader conservation strategy (it should complement habitat protection) |
| **Mastery** | Analyses global biodiversity data critically, evaluates the trade-offs between economic development and conservation, and synthesises arguments from ecology, genetics and ethics to justify conservation policy. | Discussing conservation priorities without using specific ecological evidence or examples; Not acknowledging the limitations of any single prioritisation framework |

## Thinking lens: Systems and System Models (primary)

**Key question:** What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?

**Why this lens fits:** Bodily systems (circulatory, digestive, skeletal) are interacting systems; tracing inputs, outputs and feedback between them deepens the structural understanding.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- What assumptions does this model make, and how do they limit its predictions?
- Are there tipping points where small changes produce large systemic effects?
- How would you choose between two competing models of this system?
- Can this phenomenon be explained by looking at parts alone, or does it require a systems perspective?

**Secondary lens:** Structure and Function — Body parts, organs and systems are understood by connecting their physical structure to their biological function — why is the heart shaped as it is, and how does that shape enable pumping?

## Session structure: Fieldwork

### Fieldwork
Learning through direct observation and data collection in the field (or simulated field environment). Includes preparation and planning, systematic data collection using fieldwork techniques, data processing and presentation, analysis of findings, and a conclusion that addresses the enquiry question.

`preparation` → `field_data_collection` → `processing` → `analysis` → `conclusion`

**Assessment:** Fieldwork report including methodology, data presentation using appropriate techniques (maps, graphs, tables, photographs), analysis of patterns, and conclusion with evaluation of data reliability.

**Teacher note:** Use the FIELDWORK template: expect pupils to design a fieldwork methodology with justified sampling, appropriate quantitative and qualitative techniques, and risk assessment. Demand rigorous data processing including statistical analysis where appropriate. Guide critical evaluation of methodology, data quality, and conclusions, with reference to how fieldwork evidence supports or challenges geographical or scientific theory.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does your sampling strategy ensure your data is representative?
- What statistical techniques will you use to analyse your field data?
- How do your fieldwork conclusions relate to the broader geographical or scientific theory?
- What methodological improvements would strengthen your investigation?

## Variables

**Independent:** distance along transect (proxy for environmental gradient) or specific abiotic factor
**Dependent:** abundance or percentage cover of target species
**Controlled:** quadrat size, sampling method (systematic along transect), time of day, season

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- quadrats (0.5m × 0.5m)
- tape measures (30m)
- identification keys
- light meter
- soil moisture meter
- soil thermometer
- pH meter or indicator paper
- tally counters
- clipboards
- calculator

**Safety notes:** Complete a site-specific risk assessment before fieldwork. Check for pupil allergies (pollen, insect stings). Wear appropriate clothing and footwear. Wash hands thoroughly after handling soil and organisms. Stay within designated areas. Carry a first aid kit. Avoid unstable ground near water bodies. Check weather forecast and postpone in dangerous conditions. (Hazard level: low)

---

## Expected outcome

Organisms are not randomly distributed — their abundance correlates with abiotic factors (light, moisture, pH, temperature). A belt transect across an environmental gradient (e.g. field to woodland edge) reveals systematic changes in species distribution. Pupils can calculate species frequency, percentage cover, and population estimates using sampling data. Statistical analysis reveals whether observed patterns are significant or due to chance.

**Recording format:** belt transect data table (species count per quadrat at each distance), kite diagram or bar chart of species distribution along transect, scatter graph of species abundance vs abiotic factor, population estimate calculation

---

## Enquiry type

### Observation Over Time
A systematic enquiry where changes are observed and recorded at intervals over a period of time — hours, days, weeks, or longer. Used when the process being studied is too slow for a single lesson or when the pattern only emerges through repeated observation. Develops patience, systematic recording, and the ability to identify trends.

**Question stems:**
- How does [thing being observed] change over time?
- What happens to [variable] over [time period]?
- What pattern can you see in how [process] changes?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What do you think will happen over time? Why?
- How often should we observe and record?
- What exactly will we look for or measure each time?
- What pattern can you see in the observations?
- Can you explain why this pattern happens?

### Pattern Seeking
An enquiry where pupils look for relationships or correlations between variables in situations where it is not possible or appropriate to control all the variables. Data is collected and analysed to determine whether there is a pattern — 'Is there a link between X and Y?' — without necessarily establishing causation.

**Question stems:**
- Is there a pattern between [variable A] and [variable B]?
- Do [things with property X] also tend to [show property Y]?
- Can you put these in order of [property] and see what pattern emerges?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- Is there a pattern between [variable A] and [variable B]?
- What do you notice when you compare [these examples]?
- Can you put these in order? What pattern emerges?
- Why might this pattern exist?
- Does the pattern always hold, or are there exceptions?

## Known misconceptions

### Decomposers are unimportant
**What pupils may say:** Decomposers are not important in an ecosystem — they just eat dead things.
**Correct explanation:** Decomposers (bacteria and fungi) are essential for recycling nutrients. When organisms die, decomposers break down the dead material and release minerals back into the soil. Plants absorb these minerals and use them to grow. Without decomposers, nutrients would be locked up in dead organisms and the soil would become depleted, eventually preventing plant growth and collapsing the entire food web.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- What would happen if all the decomposers in an ecosystem died?
- How do nutrients get from dead organisms back to living plants?
- Why are decomposers sometimes called 'nature's recyclers'?

### Energy is recycled in ecosystems
**What pupils may say:** Energy is recycled in an ecosystem just like materials are.
**Correct explanation:** Energy flows through an ecosystem in one direction and is not recycled. At each trophic level, energy is lost as heat through respiration. This is why food chains rarely have more than four or five levels — there is not enough energy left to support another level. Materials (nutrients like carbon and nitrogen) ARE recycled through biogeochemical cycles. Energy flows; materials cycle.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- What happens to the energy at each level of a food chain?
- Why are there usually only 4-5 levels in a food chain?
- What is the difference between how energy and materials move through an ecosystem?

### Removing one species only affects its predator
**What pupils may say:** Removing one species from a food web only affects the animal that eats it.
**Correct explanation:** Removing a species from a food web has cascading effects throughout the ecosystem due to interdependence. If a prey species is removed, its predators lose a food source (they may decline or switch prey). The organisms the prey species ate may increase in number. These changes ripple through the entire web. This is why biodiversity matters — the more connections in a food web, the more resilient it is.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- If all the rabbits in a meadow ecosystem died, which other organisms would be affected? Only foxes?
- What would happen to the grass if the rabbits disappeared?
- Why does removing one species affect organisms that are not directly connected to it?

## Why this study matters

Fieldwork is irreplaceable for developing scientific reasoning about real ecosystems. The belt transect method provides a structured approach to pattern seeking in a complex, variable environment. Correlating species distribution with measured abiotic factors teaches pupils to identify relationships in data without controlled experiments — a critical distinction from fair testing. The inherent messiness of ecological data develops statistical thinking and the ability to draw cautious conclusions.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils place quadrats only in visually interesting areas rather than at systematic intervals along the transect — enforce systematic or stratified random sampling
2. Confusing correlation with causation — just because daisy abundance correlates with light intensity does not prove light causes the pattern; there may be confounding variables
3. Difficulty estimating percentage cover consistently — practise with photographs before going outside

## Sensitive content

- Fieldwork requires risk assessment — check allergies, ensure appropriate clothing, and carry first aid equipment
- Some pupils may be anxious about outdoor environments or handling organisms — provide alternatives for engagement
