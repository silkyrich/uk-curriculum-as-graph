## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Electromagnetic Spectrum (PH-KS4-C011)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The electromagnetic spectrum is a continuous range of transverse waves that all travel at the same speed in a vacuum (3 × 10⁸ m/s). From longest to shortest wavelength: radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, gamma rays. Higher frequency EM waves carry more energy per photon. Ionising radiation (X-rays, gamma rays, high-energy UV) can cause ionisation of atoms, damage DNA and increase the risk of cancer.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach the spectrum mnemonic: 'Rude Martians Invaded Venus Using X-ray Guns'. For each region of the spectrum, pupils must know the wavelength range (approximately), typical sources, and practical uses and hazards. Emphasise that visible light is just one small part of the EM spectrum. The relationship between photon energy and frequency (E = hf) is not required at GCSE but the qualitative relationship (higher frequency = more energetic photons = more ionising) should be understood. Connect to atomic structure (gamma rays from radioactive decay) and medical physics (X-ray imaging, radiotherapy).

**Key vocabulary:** electromagnetic spectrum, radio wave, microwave, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-ray, gamma ray, frequency, wavelength, speed of light, ionisation, photon, cancer risk

**Common misconceptions:** Students often order the spectrum incorrectly, particularly forgetting the correct position of microwaves (between radio and infrared) and ultraviolet (between visible and X-rays). Students also think microwaves in ovens work by ionising food molecules — microwaves cause water molecules to vibrate, generating heat by friction; they do not ionise. Students confuse gamma rays (from nuclear decay) with X-rays (from electron interactions) — both are high-energy EM radiation but they have different sources.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Names the main regions of the electromagnetic spectrum in order of wavelength or frequency and gives one use for each. | List the electromagnetic spectrum in order from longest wavelength to shortest and give one use of each type. | Placing the types in the wrong order or omitting one region; Confusing microwaves with radio waves or ultraviolet with X-rays |
| **Developing** | Describes how all electromagnetic waves are transverse, travel at the speed of light in a vacuum, and differ only in wavelength and frequency. Relates wave properties to uses and hazards. | Explain why all electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed in a vacuum but have different frequencies and wavelengths. | Stating that higher frequency waves travel faster — all EM waves have the same speed in a vacuum; Confusing the properties of EM waves with sound waves (e.g. stating EM waves are longitudinal) |
| **Secure** | Explains the hazards of different EM radiations at a cellular level (ionisation, heating), evaluates the balance of risk and benefit for medical and industrial uses, and applies the relationship between frequency, wavelength, and energy to explain penetration and absorption. | Compare the hazards and medical uses of X-rays and gamma rays. Explain why both can be useful despite being dangerous. | Stating that X-rays are 'safe' for medical use without discussing risk minimisation; Not explaining why ionising radiation damages cells — it is the ionisation of DNA molecules, not just general 'damage' |
| **Mastery** | Analyses applications across the full EM spectrum in unfamiliar contexts, evaluates competing technologies, and discusses the physics behind detection methods, atmospheric absorption windows, and the social implications of EM technology. | Explain why astronomers use telescopes operating at different EM wavelengths (radio, infrared, visible, X-ray) and why some must be in space. Evaluate the importance of multi-wavelength astronomy. | Not explaining why the atmosphere blocks certain wavelengths (absorption by gases such as ozone for UV, water vapour for IR); Treating all telescopes as equivalent rather than recognising that different wavelengths require different detection technologies |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Radio waves (TV and radio broadcasting), microwaves (cooking and satellite communication), infrared (thermal imaging and remote controls), visible light (seeing and photography), ultraviolet (fluorescent lamps and detecting forged banknotes), X-rays (medical imaging of bones), gamma rays (treating cancer).*

> **Model response (Developing):** *All EM waves are oscillating electric and magnetic fields that propagate at 3 × 10⁸ m/s in a vacuum. They differ in frequency and wavelength, which are inversely related (v = fλ, with v constant). Higher frequency means shorter wavelength. The energy carried by the wave increases with frequency, which is why gamma rays are more ionising than radio waves.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Both X-rays and gamma rays are ionising — they can remove electrons from atoms, damaging DNA and causing mutations or cell death. X-rays are used in medical imaging because they are absorbed differently by bone and soft tissue, creating contrast images. The benefit (diagnosis) outweighs the risk when exposure is minimised (lead shielding, limited dose). Gamma rays are used in radiotherapy: a focused beam targets cancer cells. Healthy tissue is damaged too, but rotating the beam source around the patient concentrates the dose at the tumour. In both cases, the ionising nature that makes them dangerous also makes them useful — the key is controlled, targeted exposure.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Different astronomical objects and processes emit strongly at different wavelengths: hot gas in galaxy clusters emits X-rays; stars peak in visible/UV; cool dust clouds emit infrared; pulsars emit radio waves. Earth's atmosphere absorbs most EM radiation except visible light and radio waves (atmospheric windows). X-ray and gamma-ray telescopes must be in space (e.g. Chandra, Fermi) because the atmosphere blocks these wavelengths. Infrared telescopes benefit from space (e.g. JWST) to avoid atmospheric water vapour absorption and thermal noise. Multi-wavelength astronomy is essential because no single wavelength reveals the complete picture — combining data reveals temperature, composition, motion, and magnetic field information that would be invisible in any single band.*

### Secondary concept: Energy Stores and Transfers (PH-KS4-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Energy is stored in physical systems in various ways: kinetic (moving objects), gravitational potential (objects above a reference level), elastic potential (deformed objects), chemical (fuels, food), thermal (hot objects), nuclear (unstable nuclei), electromagnetic (electric/magnetic fields). Energy is neither created nor destroyed (conservation of energy) but transferred between stores by mechanical work, electrical work, heating or radiation. Useful energy transfers are always accompanied by dissipation to the thermal store of the surroundings.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Identifies basic energy stores (kinetic, thermal, gravitational potential) and recognises that energy can be transferred between stores. | Describing energy as being 'used up' or 'created' rather than transferred between stores; Confusing energy stores with energy transfer pathways (e.g. saying 'sound energy store') |
| **Developing** | Describes energy transfers using correct store terminology, calculates kinetic and gravitational potential energy using standard formulae, and recognises conservation of energy. | Forgetting to state the assumption about negligible air resistance when equating GPE to KE; Using incorrect units or confusing mass in kg with weight in N in the GPE formula |
| **Secure** | Applies energy conservation quantitatively across multi-step problems, calculates efficiency, and draws and interprets Sankey diagrams for real systems. | Drawing Sankey diagram arrows that do not conserve total width (input width must equal sum of output widths); Confusing power (rate of energy transfer) with total energy transferred when calculating efficiency |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates energy transfer scenarios critically, combines power, work done, and efficiency in extended calculations, and analyses the limitations of energy models in real-world contexts. | Failing to identify multiple dissipation pathways and only listing one source of energy loss; Not linking the impossibility of 100% recovery to fundamental thermodynamic principles |

### Secondary concept: Specific Heat Capacity and Latent Heat (PH-KS4-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Specific heat capacity (c) is the energy required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of a material by 1°C: Q = mcΔT. Different materials require different amounts of energy for the same temperature change, which explains why water is used as a coolant and why land heats up faster than sea. Latent heat is the energy transferred during a change of state at constant temperature; specific latent heat (L) is the energy required per kilogram: Q = mL.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Recognises that different materials heat up at different rates and that changes of state require energy input or release without a temperature change. | Stating the metal 'has more heat' rather than explaining the rate of thermal energy transfer; Confusing temperature with thermal energy — believing a small hot object has more energy than a large warm one |
| **Developing** | Uses the specific heat capacity equation (E = mcΔθ) to calculate energy changes for heating and cooling, and identifies specific latent heat as the energy for a change of state. | Using the final temperature instead of the temperature change (Δθ) in the equation; Forgetting that during a change of state the temperature remains constant, so SHC equation does not apply |
| **Secure** | Combines SHC and specific latent heat calculations in multi-step problems, interprets heating curves showing plateaus at changes of state, and explains the particle model basis for these energy changes. | Not recognising that the gradient differs between solid, liquid, and gas phases because they have different SHC values; Confusing latent heat of fusion with latent heat of vaporisation or using the wrong value in calculations |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates experimental methods for determining SHC and latent heat, analyses sources of systematic error, and applies combined calculations to unfamiliar engineering or environmental contexts. | Stating the experimental value is 'wrong' without identifying the direction and cause of systematic error; Not recognising that energy losses always make the experimental SHC appear lower than the true value |

### Secondary concept: Particle Model, Density and Gas Laws (PH-KS4-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The particle model describes matter as composed of tiny particles in constant motion. In solids, particles vibrate about fixed positions; in liquids, particles can flow but remain in contact; in gases, particles move rapidly and are widely separated. Density (ρ = m/V) depends on particle mass and separation. Gas pressure is caused by particles colliding with the container walls. Increasing temperature increases the kinetic energy and speed of particles, increasing the rate and force of collisions.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Describes the particle arrangements in solids, liquids, and gases, and relates these to macroscopic properties such as shape, volume, and compressibility. | Drawing gas particles as stationary or evenly spaced rather than randomly distributed and moving; Stating that particles 'expand' when heated rather than that they move faster and spread further apart |
| **Developing** | Calculates density using ρ = m/V, describes how temperature relates to average kinetic energy of particles, and explains pressure in gases using particle collisions with container walls. | Failing to convert cm³ to m³ correctly (1 m³ = 1,000,000 cm³, not 100 cm³); Mixing grams and kilograms without converting, giving an answer out by a factor of 1000 |
| **Secure** | Applies the gas laws (pV = constant at constant T; p/T = constant at constant V) to solve problems, links gas pressure to particle kinetic energy and collision frequency, and explains density differences between states using the particle model. | Stating that particles 'move faster' when compressed at constant temperature — speed is unchanged, only collision frequency increases; Applying Boyle's law to situations where temperature changes, invalidating the constant-temperature assumption |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates the limitations of the simple particle model, applies gas law calculations to unfamiliar contexts, and analyses experimental methods for measuring density of regular and irregular objects including sources of error. | Not identifying that trapped air bubbles systematically increase volume and therefore decrease the density calculation; Confusing systematic errors (air bubbles, porous stone) with random errors (reading the meniscus) in evaluation |

### Secondary concept: Wave Properties and Behaviour (PH-KS4-C010)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

A wave transfers energy without transferring matter. Transverse waves (light, electromagnetic waves, water waves) have oscillations perpendicular to the direction of wave travel. Longitudinal waves (sound) have oscillations parallel to the direction of wave travel. All waves can be described by amplitude, wavelength, frequency, period and speed. The wave equation v = fλ relates speed, frequency and wavelength. Waves undergo reflection (change of direction at a boundary), refraction (change of speed and direction when entering a different medium) and diffraction (spreading of waves around obstacles or through gaps).

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Identifies basic wave properties (amplitude, wavelength, frequency) and distinguishes between transverse and longitudinal waves with examples. | Stating that particles in a wave travel from source to receiver rather than oscillating about a fixed point; Confusing transverse and longitudinal — describing sound waves as transverse |
| **Developing** | Applies the wave equation v = fλ, measures wave properties from diagrams and oscilloscope traces, and describes reflection, refraction, and diffraction qualitatively. | Confusing wavelength with amplitude when reading wave diagrams; Using the wrong rearrangement of v = fλ (e.g. calculating f × λ instead of v/f) |
| **Secure** | Explains refraction using changes in wave speed at boundaries, applies the law of reflection, describes diffraction through gaps and around obstacles, and interprets oscilloscope traces for frequency and amplitude changes. | Stating that frequency changes during refraction — frequency remains constant; speed and wavelength change; Drawing the refracted ray bending away from the normal when going into a denser medium |
| **Mastery** | Analyses total internal reflection and critical angle, applies Snell's law quantitatively, evaluates the effects of diffraction on resolution and communication, and discusses wave behaviour in complex real-world applications such as fibre optics and seismology. | Confusing the critical angle condition (angle must exceed the critical angle for TIR) with regular refraction; Not recognising that TIR only occurs when light travels from a denser to a less dense medium |

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** Sorting, classifying and identifying similarities directly trains pupils to recognise regularities and use them to predict or generalise.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- How would you formalise this pattern mathematically?
- What are the limits of this pattern — where does it break down?
- Could this pattern be an artefact of how the data was collected?
- Does identifying the pattern tell us why it occurs?

**Secondary lens:** Cause and Effect — Physical phenomena (shadows, circuits, forces) involve clear causal chains: changing one variable produces a predictable effect, making cause-and-effect reasoning the investigative frame.

---

## Session structure: Fair Test

### Fair Test
The classic scientific enquiry: formulating a testable question, making a prediction based on scientific understanding, designing a method that controls variables, collecting and recording data systematically, analysing results, and drawing a conclusion linked back to the original hypothesis.

`question` → `hypothesis` → `method` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `conclusion`

**Assessment:** Structured scientific report including question, hypothesis with reasoning, method with variables identified, results table/graph, and conclusion evaluating whether results support the hypothesis.

**Teacher note:** Use the FAIR TEST template: expect pupils to derive a testable hypothesis from scientific theory and design a rigorous method with appropriate controls, precision, and sample size. Guide analysis using statistical techniques or mathematical modelling where appropriate. Demand critical evaluation of validity, reliability, accuracy, and the extent to which results support or refute the hypothesis.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does your hypothesis follow from the underlying scientific theory?
- How have you ensured sufficient precision, accuracy, and reliability in your method?
- What statistical analysis supports your conclusion?
- To what extent do your results support the hypothesis, and what are the limitations?

## Variables

**Independent:** surface colour and texture (matt black, matt white, shiny silver, shiny black)
**Dependent:** infrared radiation reading (temperature recorded by sensor at fixed distance)
**Controlled:** distance of sensor from surface, temperature of water in cube, time allowed for cube to reach thermal equilibrium

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- Leslie cube (metal cube with different surface finishes)
- infrared thermometer or thermal sensor
- boiling water (teacher pours)
- thermometers
- stopwatch
- matt black and shiny silver surfaces
- heat lamp

**Safety notes:** The Leslie cube is filled with near-boiling water — teacher handles this step. Do not touch the cube surfaces. Infrared thermometers should be pointed at the cube, never at faces. Keep hands clear of the heat lamp. Allow apparatus to cool before handling for cleanup. (Hazard level: standard)

---

## Expected outcome

Matt black surfaces are the best emitters AND absorbers of infrared radiation. Shiny silver surfaces are the worst emitters and absorbers (best reflectors). The infrared thermometer reading is highest when pointed at the matt black face of the Leslie cube and lowest when pointed at the shiny silver face. This explains why radiators are painted white (compromise between emission and aesthetics) and why survival blankets are shiny (to reflect body heat back).

**Recording format:** data table of surface type and infrared reading, bar chart comparing emission from different surfaces, explanation linking to electromagnetic spectrum and particle model

## Enquiry type

### Fair Test
A controlled investigation where one variable is deliberately changed while all others are kept the same, to determine whether the changed variable has an effect on a measured outcome. The gold-standard enquiry type for causal questions in science.

**Question stems:**
- How does [independent variable] affect [dependent variable]?
- Does changing [variable] make a difference to [outcome]?
- What is the relationship between [variable A] and [variable B]?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What will you change? (independent variable)
- What will you measure or observe? (dependent variable)
- What will you keep the same? (controlled variables)
- What do you predict will happen? Why?
- Was your prediction correct? What does the evidence show?

### Pattern Seeking
An enquiry where pupils look for relationships or correlations between variables in situations where it is not possible or appropriate to control all the variables. Data is collected and analysed to determine whether there is a pattern — 'Is there a link between X and Y?' — without necessarily establishing causation.

**Question stems:**
- Is there a pattern between [variable A] and [variable B]?
- Do [things with property X] also tend to [show property Y]?
- Can you put these in order of [property] and see what pattern emerges?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- Is there a pattern between [variable A] and [variable B]?
- What do you notice when you compare [these examples]?
- Can you put these in order? What pattern emerges?
- Why might this pattern exist?
- Does the pattern always hold, or are there exceptions?

## Known misconceptions

### Cold flows into objects
**What pupils may say:** Cold flows into warm objects — that is why things cool down.
**Correct explanation:** There is no such thing as 'cold' as a form of energy. What happens is that thermal energy transfers from hotter objects to cooler objects. When you touch a cold window, heat transfers from your warm hand to the cold glass — it feels cold because you are losing heat, not because 'cold' is flowing into you. Energy always transfers from hot to cold, never the other way.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- When you hold an ice cube and it feels cold, is cold flowing into your hand or heat flowing out?
- What direction does thermal energy always transfer?
- Why does a metal spoon feel colder than a wooden spoon at the same temperature?

### Insulators create heat
**What pupils may say:** Insulators make things warmer — a jumper produces heat.
**Correct explanation:** Insulators do not produce heat. They reduce the rate at which thermal energy transfers from a warm object to cooler surroundings. A jumper feels warm because it slows down the loss of heat from your body — your body is the heat source, not the jumper. If you wrapped a jumper around an ice cube, it would slow down the ice melting, not warm it up.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- If you wrap a jumper around an ice cube, will it melt faster or slower?
- Where does the warmth come from when you put on a coat?
- Does insulation produce heat or slow down heat loss?


---

## Why this study matters

This required practical connects the electromagnetic spectrum to everyday thermal physics. The Leslie cube provides dramatic, measurable differences between surfaces that challenge everyday assumptions (pupils often expect 'white = hot' because white things feel warmer in sunlight — but that is absorption, not emission). The investigation develops understanding of infrared radiation as an energy transfer mechanism that does not require a medium, distinguishing it from conduction and convection. Linking the results to real-world applications (house insulation, thermos flasks, survival blankets) demonstrates the utility of physics knowledge.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils confuse emission and absorption — the Leslie cube tests emission; a separate experiment with a heat lamp tests absorption. Be explicit about which is being measured
2. Holding the sensor at different distances from each face invalidates the comparison — use a fixed distance for all readings
3. Pupils think colour determines temperature — colour affects the rate of emission/absorption, not the temperature itself
