## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Collision Theory and Reaction Rates (CH-KS4-C010)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Chemical reactions occur when reactant particles collide with sufficient energy (equal to or greater than the activation energy) and with correct orientation. Increasing concentration increases the frequency of collisions; increasing temperature increases both the frequency and energy of collisions; increasing surface area increases the frequency of collisions; a catalyst provides an alternative reaction pathway with lower activation energy.

**Teaching guidance:** Required Practicals 6 and 7: sodium thiosulfate + acid (turbidity method) and marble chips + acid (gas volume method). Pupils should be able to measure and calculate mean rate of reaction from experimental data, and plot and interpret rate curves. Emphasise that catalysts are not consumed in reactions and do not change the overall energy change of the reaction — they only lower the activation energy. Biological catalysts (enzymes) should be connected to the Biology specification.

**Key vocabulary:** collision theory, activation energy, frequency of collisions, concentration, pressure, temperature, surface area, catalyst, enzyme, rate of reaction, Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution

**Common misconceptions:** Students say catalysts 'speed up reactions by giving energy to particles' — clarify that catalysts lower the activation energy by providing an alternative pathway. Students also think increasing temperature only increases collision frequency, forgetting the crucial effect on collision energy. Students confuse rate of reaction (speed) with yield (how much product is made).

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that reactions go faster when heated or when using smaller pieces, but cannot explain why using collision theory. | Why does increasing the temperature increase the rate of a chemical reaction? | Only mentioning increased collision frequency without mentioning increased collision energy; Saying particles 'collide harder' without linking this to activation energy |
| **Developing** | Can use collision theory to explain the effect of all five factors (concentration, temperature, surface area, pressure, catalyst) on reaction rate, and can calculate mean rate from experimental data. | Calculate the mean rate of reaction if 60 cm³ of gas is collected in 120 seconds. | Dividing time by volume instead of volume by time; Not including correct units in the answer |
| **Secure** | Interprets rate curves from experimental data, calculates rate at specific points from tangent gradients, and designs controlled experiments to investigate rate factors. | A gas collection curve starts steep and then levels off. What does the gradient at any point represent? Why does the curve level off? | Saying the reaction 'slows down because it runs out of energy' rather than correctly explaining that reactant concentration decreases; Not recognising that the final flat section means the reaction is complete, not just slow |
| **Mastery** | Analyses rate data quantitatively, evaluates the effectiveness of different catalysts, and connects collision theory to industrial process optimisation. | In the Haber process (N₂ + 3H₂ ⇌ 2NH₃), explain why an iron catalyst is used even though it does not change the equilibrium position. | Saying the catalyst increases the yield of ammonia (it does not — it only increases the rate); Not connecting the catalyst's role to the economic viability of the industrial process |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Increasing temperature gives the particles more kinetic energy. They move faster, so they collide more frequently AND with more energy. More collisions exceed the activation energy, so more collisions are successful and the reaction is faster.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Mean rate = volume of gas / time = 60 / 120 = 0.5 cm³/s.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *The gradient at any point represents the rate of reaction at that instant. The initial steep gradient indicates a fast rate because reactant concentrations are highest. As reactants are consumed, their concentration decreases, so collisions become less frequent and the rate decreases (the gradient becomes less steep). The curve levels off when one reactant is completely used up — the reaction has finished and no more gas is produced.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *The iron catalyst lowers the activation energy for both the forward and reverse reactions equally, so it does not change the equilibrium position or the yield of ammonia. Its value is in increasing the rate at which equilibrium is reached. Without a catalyst, the reaction would be so slow at the operating temperature (450°C) that the plant would be economically unviable. The catalyst allows the process to operate at a lower temperature than would otherwise be needed to achieve an acceptable rate, which has the added benefit of favouring the forward reaction (exothermic, so lower temperature shifts equilibrium to the right). This illustrates the industrial compromise: the catalyst enables a practical rate at a temperature that gives a reasonable yield (~15%), which is economically optimal even though it is not the thermodynamic optimum.*

### Secondary concept: Atomic Structure and Subatomic Particles (CH-KS4-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

An atom consists of a very small, dense, positively charged nucleus containing protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons in shells at relatively large distances. Protons have a mass of 1 and charge of +1; neutrons have a mass of 1 and charge of 0; electrons have negligible mass and charge of -1. The atomic number (proton number) identifies the element; the mass number is the total of protons and neutrons.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can name the three subatomic particles and state that atoms have a nucleus, but confuses their charges and relative masses or cannot use the periodic table to determine particle numbers. | Stating that neutrons have a positive charge; Confusing atomic number (number of protons) with mass number (protons + neutrons) |
| **Developing** | Can use the periodic table to determine the number of protons, neutrons and electrons in an atom, and understands what isotopes are, but struggles with ion electron configurations. | Thinking ions have different numbers of protons from the neutral atom; Subtracting atomic number from mass number the wrong way round |
| **Secure** | Explains the historical development of atomic models with reference to experimental evidence, calculates relative atomic masses from isotope data, and applies the nuclear model to explain ion formation. | Describing the experiment without linking each observation to a specific conclusion about atomic structure; Confusing the Rutherford model (nuclear) with the Bohr model (electron shells) |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates the strengths and limitations of successive atomic models, calculates relative atomic masses from isotope abundance data, and explains why models in science are provisional and subject to revision. | Simply averaging 35 and 37 to get 36 instead of using the weighted calculation; Not explaining why the RAM is an average rather than the mass of any individual atom |

### Secondary concept: Moles and Stoichiometry (CH-KS4-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

The mole is the unit of amount of substance; 1 mole of any substance contains 6.02 × 10²³ particles (Avogadro's number). The relative formula mass (Mr) numerically equals the mass in grams of 1 mole. Stoichiometry uses balanced equations to determine the molar ratios of reactants and products, allowing calculation of the mass of any reactant or product if the mass of another is known.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that chemical equations must be balanced and that mass is conserved, but struggles with mole calculations and confuses mass with amount of substance. | Forgetting to multiply the mass of oxygen by 3; Adding atomic numbers instead of atomic masses |
| **Developing** | Can calculate Mr, convert between mass and moles using moles = mass/Mr, and use molar ratios from balanced equations, but makes errors in multi-step calculations. | Using the wrong molar ratio from the balanced equation; Dividing by Mr when they should multiply (or vice versa) in the final step |
| **Secure** | Performs multi-step stoichiometry calculations confidently, including limiting reagent problems and concentration calculations, and can explain the significance of conservation of mass. | Forgetting to convert cm³ to dm³ (divide by 1000); Using a 1:1 ratio instead of the correct 2:1 ratio from the balanced equation |
| **Mastery** | Applies stoichiometry to complex industrial and analytical contexts, evaluates sources of error in quantitative experiments, and uses the ideal gas equation for gas volume calculations. | Confusing precision with accuracy — precise results can be inaccurate if there is systematic error; Not distinguishing between systematic errors (consistent bias) and random errors (scatter around the true value) |

### Secondary concept: Exothermic and Endothermic Reactions (CH-KS4-C009)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Chemical reactions involve breaking bonds in reactants (endothermic, requires energy) and forming bonds in products (exothermic, releases energy). If more energy is released forming bonds than is required breaking bonds, the overall reaction is exothermic and energy is released to the surroundings (temperature increases). If more energy is required to break bonds than is released forming bonds, the overall reaction is endothermic and energy is absorbed from the surroundings (temperature decreases).

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can give examples of exothermic and endothermic reactions and knows that exothermic reactions release heat, but confuses bond breaking (endothermic) with bond forming (exothermic). | Saying 'breaking bonds releases energy' — breaking bonds always requires energy; Confusing exothermic (energy released, temperature increases) with endothermic (energy absorbed, temperature decreases) |
| **Developing** | Can draw energy level diagrams for exothermic and endothermic reactions, including activation energy, and understands that overall energy change depends on bond breaking versus bond forming. | Drawing the products above the reactants for an exothermic reaction (products should be lower); Forgetting to include the activation energy hump — even exothermic reactions need energy input to start |
| **Secure** | Calculates overall energy changes using bond energy data, designs and interprets calorimetry experiments, and explains why catalysts lower activation energy but do not change the overall energy change. | Subtracting bonds broken from bonds formed instead of the correct way round; Counting the wrong number of bonds (e.g., forgetting there are 4 C-H bonds in CH₄ and 4 O-H bonds in 2H₂O) |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates the accuracy and limitations of bond energy calculations, applies energy change concepts to real-world contexts, and explains Hess's law qualitatively. | Not recognising that bond energies are averages and therefore approximate; Assuming that the calculated value should exactly match the experimental value |

### Secondary concept: Reversible Reactions and Dynamic Equilibrium (CH-KS4-C011)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Some chemical reactions are reversible: the products can react together to re-form the reactants. In a closed system, a dynamic equilibrium is established when the forward and reverse reactions occur at equal rates. The position of equilibrium can be changed by altering temperature, pressure or concentration. Le Chatelier's principle states that if a system at equilibrium is disturbed, it will shift to oppose the change.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that some reactions can go backwards and that the Haber process makes ammonia, but cannot explain dynamic equilibrium or predict the effect of changing conditions. | Thinking that ⇌ means the reaction goes forward first and then backward separately; Confusing reversible reactions with reactions that can be repeated |
| **Developing** | Can define dynamic equilibrium as a state where the forward and reverse reactions occur at equal rates, and can state Le Chatelier's principle, but struggles to apply it to specific examples. | Confusing which direction is favoured — endothermic reactions are favoured by increasing temperature; Saying 'the reaction speeds up' without specifying the effect on equilibrium position |
| **Secure** | Applies Le Chatelier's principle to predict the effect of changes in temperature, pressure and concentration on equilibrium position, and evaluates industrial compromises. | Not explaining the rate-yield trade-off (low temperature gives better yield but slower rate); Forgetting to mention that unreacted gases are recycled, which compensates for the low per-pass yield |
| **Mastery** | Analyses equilibrium shifts quantitatively, evaluates the sustainability of industrial processes, and explains why catalysts do not affect equilibrium position. | Accepting the claim that catalysts increase yield — this is one of the most common GCSE misconceptions; Not explaining the indirect benefit: catalysts allow lower operating temperatures, which can shift equilibrium |

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** Chemistry at KS4 is rich in patterns — periodic table trends, reactivity series, reaction type categories — that allow pupils to predict the behaviour of unfamiliar substances.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- How would you formalise this pattern mathematically?
- What are the limits of this pattern — where does it break down?
- Could this pattern be an artefact of how the data was collected?
- Does identifying the pattern tell us why it occurs?

**Secondary lens:** Cause and Effect — Chemical reactions involve causal mechanisms (electron transfer causes bonding, acid-base reactions follow proton transfer) that explain observed phenomena rather than merely describing them.

## Session structure: Fair Test

### Fair Test
The classic scientific enquiry: formulating a testable question, making a prediction based on scientific understanding, designing a method that controls variables, collecting and recording data systematically, analysing results, and drawing a conclusion linked back to the original hypothesis.

`question` → `hypothesis` → `method` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `conclusion`

**Assessment:** Structured scientific report including question, hypothesis with reasoning, method with variables identified, results table/graph, and conclusion evaluating whether results support the hypothesis.

**Teacher note:** Use the FAIR TEST template: expect pupils to derive a testable hypothesis from scientific theory and design a rigorous method with appropriate controls, precision, and sample size. Guide analysis using statistical techniques or mathematical modelling where appropriate. Demand critical evaluation of validity, reliability, accuracy, and the extent to which results support or refute the hypothesis.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does your hypothesis follow from the underlying scientific theory?
- How have you ensured sufficient precision, accuracy, and reliability in your method?
- What statistical analysis supports your conclusion?
- To what extent do your results support the hypothesis, and what are the limitations?

## Variables

**Independent:** concentration of sodium thiosulfate (diluted with water to maintain constant total volume)
**Dependent:** time for the cross to disappear (seconds)
**Controlled:** volume of hydrochloric acid, total volume of solution (thiosulfate + water), temperature, size and thickness of cross mark

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- sodium thiosulfate solution (40 g/dm³)
- dilute hydrochloric acid (1M)
- conical flasks
- measuring cylinders (10ml, 25ml)
- stopwatch
- paper with printed cross (X)
- safety goggles
- fume cupboard or well-ventilated area

**Safety notes:** Wear safety goggles throughout. This reaction produces sulfur dioxide gas — work in a fume cupboard or ensure very good ventilation. Pupils with asthma should be positioned away from the reaction or observe from a distance. Sodium thiosulfate is an irritant. Hydrochloric acid is corrosive at higher concentrations — use dilute (1M). Wash any splashes to skin immediately. (Hazard level: standard)

---

## Expected outcome

As the concentration of sodium thiosulfate increases, the time taken for the cross to disappear decreases because there are more reactant particles per unit volume, leading to more frequent successful collisions. Rate ∝ 1/time. Plotting rate (1/t) against concentration produces an approximately straight line through the origin, confirming a directly proportional relationship. Collision theory explains the result: higher concentration = more particles per unit volume = more frequent collisions = faster rate.

**Recording format:** data table of concentration, time, and rate (1/time), scatter graph of rate (1/t) vs concentration, conclusion linking to collision theory

---

## Enquiry type

### Fair Test
A controlled investigation where one variable is deliberately changed while all others are kept the same, to determine whether the changed variable has an effect on a measured outcome. The gold-standard enquiry type for causal questions in science.

**Question stems:**
- How does [independent variable] affect [dependent variable]?
- Does changing [variable] make a difference to [outcome]?
- What is the relationship between [variable A] and [variable B]?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What will you change? (independent variable)
- What will you measure or observe? (dependent variable)
- What will you keep the same? (controlled variables)
- What do you predict will happen? Why?
- Was your prediction correct? What does the evidence show?


---

## Why this study matters

The disappearing cross method is a classic GCSE practical because it produces clear, quantitative data with a simple visual endpoint. Calculating rate as 1/time and plotting rate against concentration develops the mathematical skills examiners test heavily. The practical provides concrete evidence for collision theory — the most important explanatory model in GCSE chemistry for understanding reaction kinetics.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils forget to keep the total volume constant when diluting — if total volume changes, the depth of liquid above the cross changes, confounding the results
2. Subjective endpoint — different pupils may judge the cross to have 'disappeared' at different times. Discuss repeatability and compare results
3. Plotting time (not rate) against concentration gives a curve that is harder to interpret — always calculate 1/t

## Sensitive content

- Sulfur dioxide is produced — ensure asthmatic pupils are accommodated and the room is well ventilated
