## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Reactivity Series and Displacement Reactions (CH-KS4-C007)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The reactivity series ranks metals in order of their tendency to react with oxygen, water and acids. A more reactive metal displaces a less reactive metal from a solution of its salt (displacement reaction). Oxidation is loss of electrons and reduction is gain of electrons (OIL RIG); in displacement reactions, the more reactive metal is oxidised and the less reactive metal ion is reduced.

**Teaching guidance:** Pupils should know the order: potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, aluminium, zinc, iron, nickel, tin, lead, hydrogen, copper, silver, gold, platinum. Displacement reactions can be observed as temperature changes or colour changes. Write ionic equations and half-equations for displacement reactions. Connect extraction of metals to position in reactivity series: metals below carbon extracted by reduction with carbon; metals above carbon (aluminium) extracted by electrolysis.

**Key vocabulary:** reactivity series, displacement reaction, oxidation, reduction, OIL RIG, half-equation, ionic equation, electrolysis, ore, smelting, redox

**Common misconceptions:** Students mix up 'OIL RIG' — frequently saying oxidation is gain and reduction is loss. Regular practice with electron half-equations helps embed the correct definitions. Students also confuse which species is oxidised and which is reduced in a displacement reaction.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can list some metals in order of reactivity and knows that more reactive metals react more vigorously with acid, but cannot explain reactivity in terms of electron transfer. | Zinc is placed in copper sulfate solution and the solution changes from blue to colourless. Explain what has happened. | Describing the observation without explaining it in terms of electron transfer; Not identifying which species is oxidised and which is reduced |
| **Developing** | Can use the reactivity series to predict displacement reactions, define oxidation and reduction using OIL RIG, and write word equations for metal-acid reactions. | Predict whether iron will displace silver from silver nitrate solution. Write a word equation and identify the oxidised and reduced species. | Mixing up OIL RIG: oxidation is loss of electrons, reduction is gain of electrons; Predicting a displacement reaction when the metal is less reactive than the ion in solution |
| **Secure** | Writes balanced ionic and half equations for displacement reactions, explains metal extraction methods using reactivity, and applies redox concepts to electrolysis. | Write the ionic equation and half equations for the reaction between magnesium and copper sulfate solution. | Including spectator ions in the ionic equation; Not balancing the number of electrons in the half equations |
| **Mastery** | Applies redox principles to complex reactions including disproportionation, evaluates the economic and environmental factors in metal extraction, and analyses unfamiliar reactions using oxidation state changes. | Aluminium is extracted by electrolysis rather than reduction with carbon, despite carbon being much cheaper. Explain why, and evaluate the environmental implications. | Saying aluminium cannot be reduced by carbon without explaining why (its position in the reactivity series); Not mentioning the role of cryolite in reducing the operating temperature and energy costs |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Zinc is more reactive than copper. Zinc displaces copper from the copper sulfate solution. Zinc atoms lose electrons and form zinc ions (Zn²⁺) in solution. Copper ions (Cu²⁺) gain these electrons and form copper metal, which deposits on the zinc. The blue colour disappears because Cu²⁺ ions are removed from solution.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Yes, iron will displace silver because iron is more reactive (higher in the reactivity series). Iron + silver nitrate → iron nitrate + silver. Iron is oxidised (loses electrons: Fe → Fe²⁺ + 2e⁻). Silver is reduced (gains electrons: Ag⁺ + e⁻ → Ag).*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Ionic equation: Mg(s) + Cu²⁺(aq) → Mg²⁺(aq) + Cu(s). Oxidation half equation: Mg → Mg²⁺ + 2e⁻. Reduction half equation: Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu. Magnesium is the reducing agent (it causes reduction of Cu²⁺ by donating electrons). Copper ions are the oxidising agent.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Aluminium is above carbon in the reactivity series, so carbon cannot reduce aluminium oxide (Al₂O₃ → 2Al + 1.5O₂ requires more energy than carbon can provide). Electrolysis uses electrical energy to force the decomposition: at the cathode, Al³⁺ + 3e⁻ → Al; at the anode, 2O²⁻ → O₂ + 4e⁻. The Hall-Héroult process dissolves Al₂O₃ in molten cryolite to lower the melting point from 2072°C to ~950°C, reducing energy costs. Environmental implications: electrolysis consumes enormous amounts of electricity (~15 kWh per kg of Al), so the carbon footprint depends on the electricity source. Smelters powered by hydroelectricity (e.g., in Iceland) have much lower emissions than those powered by coal. Recycling aluminium requires only 5% of the energy of primary production, making aluminium recycling one of the most effective environmental interventions.*

### Secondary concept: Ionic Bonding and Giant Ionic Lattices (CH-KS4-C003)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Ionic bonding occurs when metal atoms lose electrons and non-metal atoms gain electrons, forming oppositely charged ions. The ions arrange themselves in a regular lattice held together by strong electrostatic forces of attraction in all directions. Giant ionic compounds have high melting and boiling points, conduct electricity when molten or in aqueous solution (ions free to move) but not when solid.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that ionic compounds are formed from metals and non-metals and involve charged particles, but cannot draw dot-and-cross diagrams or explain why ionic compounds have high melting points. | Saying sodium and chlorine 'share' electrons (that would be covalent bonding); Drawing dot-and-cross diagrams without showing the full electron configuration of each ion |
| **Developing** | Can draw dot-and-cross diagrams for simple ionic compounds and explain their high melting points in terms of strong electrostatic attractions, but struggles with properties of compounds with higher-charged ions. | Drawing the dot-and-cross diagram showing only the outer electrons rather than the complete electron arrangement of the ions; Not explaining that higher charges lead to stronger electrostatic attraction |
| **Secure** | Explains all physical properties of ionic compounds (melting point, conductivity, solubility) in terms of ionic bonding and lattice structure, and can predict properties of unfamiliar ionic compounds. | Saying 'the electrons can move' in dissolved NaCl — it is the ions, not electrons, that carry charge in ionic solutions; Not explaining that conductivity requires charged particles that are free to move |
| **Mastery** | Compares the properties of ionic compounds with different lattice structures, evaluates the limitations of the ionic model, and applies knowledge to predict behaviour in novel contexts. | Saying NaCl dissolves 'because it is ionic' without explaining the role of water's polarity; Not using the energy balance argument (lattice energy vs hydration energy) to explain why some ionic compounds are insoluble |

### Secondary concept: Moles and Stoichiometry (CH-KS4-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

The mole is the unit of amount of substance; 1 mole of any substance contains 6.02 × 10²³ particles (Avogadro's number). The relative formula mass (Mr) numerically equals the mass in grams of 1 mole. Stoichiometry uses balanced equations to determine the molar ratios of reactants and products, allowing calculation of the mass of any reactant or product if the mass of another is known.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that chemical equations must be balanced and that mass is conserved, but struggles with mole calculations and confuses mass with amount of substance. | Forgetting to multiply the mass of oxygen by 3; Adding atomic numbers instead of atomic masses |
| **Developing** | Can calculate Mr, convert between mass and moles using moles = mass/Mr, and use molar ratios from balanced equations, but makes errors in multi-step calculations. | Using the wrong molar ratio from the balanced equation; Dividing by Mr when they should multiply (or vice versa) in the final step |
| **Secure** | Performs multi-step stoichiometry calculations confidently, including limiting reagent problems and concentration calculations, and can explain the significance of conservation of mass. | Forgetting to convert cm³ to dm³ (divide by 1000); Using a 1:1 ratio instead of the correct 2:1 ratio from the balanced equation |
| **Mastery** | Applies stoichiometry to complex industrial and analytical contexts, evaluates sources of error in quantitative experiments, and uses the ideal gas equation for gas volume calculations. | Confusing precision with accuracy — precise results can be inaccurate if there is systematic error; Not distinguishing between systematic errors (consistent bias) and random errors (scatter around the true value) |

### Secondary concept: Atom Economy and Percentage Yield (CH-KS4-C006)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Percentage yield compares the actual yield of a reaction to the theoretical maximum yield: % yield = (actual yield / theoretical yield) × 100. Atom economy measures what proportion of the mass of reactants ends up in the desired product: atom economy = (Mr of desired product / sum of Mr of all products) × 100. High atom economy is a key principle of green chemistry as it minimises waste.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that some reactions produce more product than expected and some less, but confuses percentage yield with atom economy and cannot perform the calculations. | Confusing percentage yield (practical outcome) with atom economy (property of the equation); Saying yield is low because 'some chemicals evaporate' without specifying which and why |
| **Developing** | Can calculate both percentage yield and atom economy, and understands that high atom economy is desirable for sustainable chemistry, but struggles to apply this to industrial contexts. | Dividing by the Mr of reactants rather than the sum of Mr of all products; Confusing atom economy (a property of the equation) with yield (a property of how well the reaction was carried out) |
| **Secure** | Applies atom economy and yield calculations to evaluate industrial processes, explains why high atom economy is important for green chemistry, and compares alternative reaction pathways. | Concluding that the higher atom economy process is always better without considering other factors; Forgetting that atom economy refers to the stoichiometric equation, not the practical yield |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates industrial chemical processes holistically using atom economy, yield, energy costs, raw material sustainability and waste management, and applies green chemistry principles. | Discussing green chemistry in abstract terms without specific examples or quantitative improvement data; Not connecting atom economy to the broader economic and environmental impacts of waste |

### Secondary concept: Exothermic and Endothermic Reactions (CH-KS4-C009)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Chemical reactions involve breaking bonds in reactants (endothermic, requires energy) and forming bonds in products (exothermic, releases energy). If more energy is released forming bonds than is required breaking bonds, the overall reaction is exothermic and energy is released to the surroundings (temperature increases). If more energy is required to break bonds than is released forming bonds, the overall reaction is endothermic and energy is absorbed from the surroundings (temperature decreases).

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can give examples of exothermic and endothermic reactions and knows that exothermic reactions release heat, but confuses bond breaking (endothermic) with bond forming (exothermic). | Saying 'breaking bonds releases energy' — breaking bonds always requires energy; Confusing exothermic (energy released, temperature increases) with endothermic (energy absorbed, temperature decreases) |
| **Developing** | Can draw energy level diagrams for exothermic and endothermic reactions, including activation energy, and understands that overall energy change depends on bond breaking versus bond forming. | Drawing the products above the reactants for an exothermic reaction (products should be lower); Forgetting to include the activation energy hump — even exothermic reactions need energy input to start |
| **Secure** | Calculates overall energy changes using bond energy data, designs and interprets calorimetry experiments, and explains why catalysts lower activation energy but do not change the overall energy change. | Subtracting bonds broken from bonds formed instead of the correct way round; Counting the wrong number of bonds (e.g., forgetting there are 4 C-H bonds in CH₄ and 4 O-H bonds in 2H₂O) |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates the accuracy and limitations of bond energy calculations, applies energy change concepts to real-world contexts, and explains Hess's law qualitatively. | Not recognising that bond energies are averages and therefore approximate; Assuming that the calculated value should exactly match the experimental value |

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** Properties can be sorted and classified into patterns (metals conduct, insulators don't), allowing pupils to make predictions about unfamiliar materials.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- How would you formalise this pattern mathematically?
- What are the limits of this pattern — where does it break down?
- Could this pattern be an artefact of how the data was collected?
- Does identifying the pattern tell us why it occurs?

**Secondary lens:** Structure and Function — Material properties link physical structure (molecular arrangement, surface texture) to functional behaviour (waterproofing, strength, flexibility) — the key question is always 'why does this material behave this way?'

## Session structure: Fair Test

### Fair Test
The classic scientific enquiry: formulating a testable question, making a prediction based on scientific understanding, designing a method that controls variables, collecting and recording data systematically, analysing results, and drawing a conclusion linked back to the original hypothesis.

`question` → `hypothesis` → `method` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `conclusion`

**Assessment:** Structured scientific report including question, hypothesis with reasoning, method with variables identified, results table/graph, and conclusion evaluating whether results support the hypothesis.

**Teacher note:** Use the FAIR TEST template: expect pupils to derive a testable hypothesis from scientific theory and design a rigorous method with appropriate controls, precision, and sample size. Guide analysis using statistical techniques or mathematical modelling where appropriate. Demand critical evaluation of validity, reliability, accuracy, and the extent to which results support or refute the hypothesis.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does your hypothesis follow from the underlying scientific theory?
- How have you ensured sufficient precision, accuracy, and reliability in your method?
- What statistical analysis supports your conclusion?
- To what extent do your results support the hypothesis, and what are the limitations?

## Variables

**Independent:** volume of sodium hydroxide added from burette
**Dependent:** indicator colour change (endpoint identification)
**Controlled:** volume of acid (pipetted), concentration of acid, indicator type and amount, temperature

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- burette (50ml)
- conical flask
- white tile
- clamp stand and boss
- dilute hydrochloric acid (known concentration)
- sodium hydroxide solution (unknown concentration)
- phenolphthalein indicator
- wash bottle (distilled water)
- safety goggles
- gloves
- pipette (25ml) with filler

**Safety notes:** Wear safety goggles and gloves throughout. Sodium hydroxide is corrosive — wash splashes immediately with plenty of water. Hydrochloric acid is an irritant at dilute concentrations. Phenolphthalein is flammable (in ethanol) — keep away from naked flames. Use a pipette filler, NEVER pipette by mouth. Clean up any spills immediately. Know the location of the eyewash station. (Hazard level: standard)

---

## Expected outcome

Through careful titration, pupils determine the exact volume of sodium hydroxide needed to neutralise a fixed volume of hydrochloric acid. The indicator changes colour at the endpoint (phenolphthalein: colourless in acid, pink in alkali). Concordant results (within 0.10 cm³) demonstrate precision. Using the titration data, pupils can calculate the unknown concentration of the alkali using c₁V₁ = c₂V₂ or moles calculations.

**Recording format:** titration results table (rough, 1st, 2nd, 3rd titre volumes), concordant result identification, mean titre calculation (excluding rough), concentration calculation using moles

## Enquiry type

### Fair Test
A controlled investigation where one variable is deliberately changed while all others are kept the same, to determine whether the changed variable has an effect on a measured outcome. The gold-standard enquiry type for causal questions in science.

**Question stems:**
- How does [independent variable] affect [dependent variable]?
- Does changing [variable] make a difference to [outcome]?
- What is the relationship between [variable A] and [variable B]?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What will you change? (independent variable)
- What will you measure or observe? (dependent variable)
- What will you keep the same? (controlled variables)
- What do you predict will happen? Why?
- Was your prediction correct? What does the evidence show?

## Known misconceptions

### All acids are dangerous
**What pupils may say:** All acids are dangerous and will burn you.
**Correct explanation:** Many acids are weak and found in everyday foods. Citric acid is in lemons and oranges. Ethanoic acid (acetic acid) is in vinegar. Carbonic acid is in fizzy drinks. These are safe to consume. Only strong, concentrated acids (like concentrated hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid) are corrosive and dangerous. The pH value and concentration determine how hazardous an acid is.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- Is lemon juice an acid? Is it dangerous?
- What is the difference between a strong acid and a weak acid?
- Give an example of an acid that you eat or drink every day.

### Neutral means safe
**What pupils may say:** Neutral (pH 7) means safe — anything that is neutral cannot harm you.
**Correct explanation:** Neutral means pH 7, which is neither acidic nor alkaline. However, a substance can be neutral and still harmful for other reasons — for example, heavy metal solutions can be approximately neutral but extremely toxic. Conversely, many acidic substances (lemon juice, pH ~2) are perfectly safe. Safety depends on many factors beyond pH alone.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- Is pure water safe? It is neutral at pH 7.
- Could a neutral substance still be harmful? Give an example.
- Does pH tell you everything you need to know about whether a substance is safe?

## Why this study matters

Titration develops precision, patience, and quantitative chemistry skills simultaneously. Reading a burette to ±0.05 cm³ and achieving concordant results teaches the importance of careful technique. The mathematical follow-up — calculating unknown concentrations from titration volumes — integrates practical skills with moles calculations, which is the single most examined quantitative topic at GCSE chemistry. Titration also teaches pupils that real science requires multiple trials and the discipline to reject anomalous results.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils add alkali too quickly and overshoot the endpoint — practise adding drop by drop near the expected endpoint
2. Reading the burette incorrectly — read from the bottom of the meniscus, at eye level
3. Including the rough titration in the mean calculation — the rough is for finding the approximate endpoint; only concordant results should be averaged
