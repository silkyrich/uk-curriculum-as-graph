---

## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Wave Properties and Behaviour (PH-KS4-C010)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

A wave transfers energy without transferring matter. Transverse waves (light, electromagnetic waves, water waves) have oscillations perpendicular to the direction of wave travel. Longitudinal waves (sound) have oscillations parallel to the direction of wave travel. All waves can be described by amplitude, wavelength, frequency, period and speed. The wave equation v = fλ relates speed, frequency and wavelength. Waves undergo reflection (change of direction at a boundary), refraction (change of speed and direction when entering a different medium) and diffraction (spreading of waves around obstacles or through gaps).

**Teaching guidance:** Required Practical 17: investigate reflection and refraction of light using ray boxes and glass blocks; measure the refractive index using n = sin(i)/sin(r). Measure the speed of sound using the echo method or using a signal generator and microphone. Use ripple tanks to demonstrate all wave behaviours qualitatively. Pupils should be able to describe why refraction occurs (change in wave speed at a boundary causes change in direction when the wave hits at an angle). Diffraction is greatest when the wavelength is comparable to the gap size.

**Key vocabulary:** transverse wave, longitudinal wave, amplitude, wavelength, frequency, period, wave speed, wave equation, reflection, refraction, diffraction, refractive index, Snell's law

**Common misconceptions:** Students think waves move matter — waves transfer energy; matter oscillates but does not travel with the wave. Students confuse frequency and period: period is the time for one complete oscillation; frequency is the number of oscillations per second; they are reciprocals of each other. Students also think refraction only occurs when light hits a surface at 90° — at 90° (normal incidence), light passes straight through without changing direction; refraction only changes direction when the wave hits at an angle.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Identifies basic wave properties (amplitude, wavelength, frequency) and distinguishes between transverse and longitudinal waves with examples. | State one example of a transverse wave and one example of a longitudinal wave. Describe how particle movement differs in each. | Stating that particles in a wave travel from source to receiver rather than oscillating about a fixed point; Confusing transverse and longitudinal — describing sound waves as transverse |
| **Developing** | Applies the wave equation v = fλ, measures wave properties from diagrams and oscilloscope traces, and describes reflection, refraction, and diffraction qualitatively. | A sound wave has a frequency of 440 Hz and travels at 330 m/s. Calculate its wavelength. | Confusing wavelength with amplitude when reading wave diagrams; Using the wrong rearrangement of v = fλ (e.g. calculating f × λ instead of v/f) |
| **Secure** | Explains refraction using changes in wave speed at boundaries, applies the law of reflection, describes diffraction through gaps and around obstacles, and interprets oscilloscope traces for frequency and amplitude changes. | Explain why a light ray bends towards the normal when it passes from air into glass. Include a diagram description. | Stating that frequency changes during refraction — frequency remains constant; speed and wavelength change; Drawing the refracted ray bending away from the normal when going into a denser medium |
| **Mastery** | Analyses total internal reflection and critical angle, applies Snell's law quantitatively, evaluates the effects of diffraction on resolution and communication, and discusses wave behaviour in complex real-world applications such as fibre optics and seismology. | The critical angle for glass-to-air is 42°. Explain how optical fibres use total internal reflection and calculate the refractive index of the glass. Discuss one limitation of fibre optic communication. | Confusing the critical angle condition (angle must exceed the critical angle for TIR) with regular refraction; Not recognising that TIR only occurs when light travels from a denser to a less dense medium |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *A transverse wave example is a water wave — particles move up and down, perpendicular to the direction the wave travels. A longitudinal wave example is a sound wave — particles vibrate back and forth in the same direction the wave travels, creating compressions and rarefactions.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *v = fλ, so λ = v/f = 330/440 = 0.75 m.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Light travels slower in glass than in air. When the wavefront enters the glass at an angle, the part that enters first slows down while the rest continues at the original speed. This causes the wavefront to change direction, bending towards the normal. The angle of refraction is smaller than the angle of incidence. This is because the wavelength decreases in the denser medium (v = fλ; frequency stays constant, speed decreases, so wavelength decreases), causing the wave to change direction.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *When light inside the glass fibre hits the boundary at an angle greater than 42° to the normal, it is totally internally reflected — no light escapes. The fibre is designed so light always hits at angles exceeding 42°, allowing signals to travel long distances with minimal loss. Refractive index n = 1/sin(c) = 1/sin(42°) = 1/0.669 = 1.49. A limitation is signal degradation over very long distances: the pulse spreads (modal dispersion) because different paths through the fibre have slightly different lengths. This limits data rate and requires repeaters. Using single-mode fibres with very narrow cores reduces dispersion.*

### Secondary concept: Energy Stores and Transfers (PH-KS4-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Energy is stored in physical systems in various ways: kinetic (moving objects), gravitational potential (objects above a reference level), elastic potential (deformed objects), chemical (fuels, food), thermal (hot objects), nuclear (unstable nuclei), electromagnetic (electric/magnetic fields). Energy is neither created nor destroyed (conservation of energy) but transferred between stores by mechanical work, electrical work, heating or radiation. Useful energy transfers are always accompanied by dissipation to the thermal store of the surroundings.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Identifies basic energy stores (kinetic, thermal, gravitational potential) and recognises that energy can be transferred between stores. | Describing energy as being 'used up' or 'created' rather than transferred between stores; Confusing energy stores with energy transfer pathways (e.g. saying 'sound energy store') |
| **Developing** | Describes energy transfers using correct store terminology, calculates kinetic and gravitational potential energy using standard formulae, and recognises conservation of energy. | Forgetting to state the assumption about negligible air resistance when equating GPE to KE; Using incorrect units or confusing mass in kg with weight in N in the GPE formula |
| **Secure** | Applies energy conservation quantitatively across multi-step problems, calculates efficiency, and draws and interprets Sankey diagrams for real systems. | Drawing Sankey diagram arrows that do not conserve total width (input width must equal sum of output widths); Confusing power (rate of energy transfer) with total energy transferred when calculating efficiency |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates energy transfer scenarios critically, combines power, work done, and efficiency in extended calculations, and analyses the limitations of energy models in real-world contexts. | Failing to identify multiple dissipation pathways and only listing one source of energy loss; Not linking the impossibility of 100% recovery to fundamental thermodynamic principles |

### Secondary concept: Particle Model, Density and Gas Laws (PH-KS4-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The particle model describes matter as composed of tiny particles in constant motion. In solids, particles vibrate about fixed positions; in liquids, particles can flow but remain in contact; in gases, particles move rapidly and are widely separated. Density (ρ = m/V) depends on particle mass and separation. Gas pressure is caused by particles colliding with the container walls. Increasing temperature increases the kinetic energy and speed of particles, increasing the rate and force of collisions.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Describes the particle arrangements in solids, liquids, and gases, and relates these to macroscopic properties such as shape, volume, and compressibility. | Drawing gas particles as stationary or evenly spaced rather than randomly distributed and moving; Stating that particles 'expand' when heated rather than that they move faster and spread further apart |
| **Developing** | Calculates density using ρ = m/V, describes how temperature relates to average kinetic energy of particles, and explains pressure in gases using particle collisions with container walls. | Failing to convert cm³ to m³ correctly (1 m³ = 1,000,000 cm³, not 100 cm³); Mixing grams and kilograms without converting, giving an answer out by a factor of 1000 |
| **Secure** | Applies the gas laws (pV = constant at constant T; p/T = constant at constant V) to solve problems, links gas pressure to particle kinetic energy and collision frequency, and explains density differences between states using the particle model. | Stating that particles 'move faster' when compressed at constant temperature — speed is unchanged, only collision frequency increases; Applying Boyle's law to situations where temperature changes, invalidating the constant-temperature assumption |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates the limitations of the simple particle model, applies gas law calculations to unfamiliar contexts, and analyses experimental methods for measuring density of regular and irregular objects including sources of error. | Not identifying that trapped air bubbles systematically increase volume and therefore decrease the density calculation; Confusing systematic errors (air bubbles, porous stone) with random errors (reading the meniscus) in evaluation |

### Secondary concept: Newton's Laws of Motion (PH-KS4-C008)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Newton's first law: an object remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by a resultant force. Newton's second law: the resultant force on an object equals its mass times its acceleration (F = ma); the acceleration is in the direction of the resultant force. Newton's third law: when object A exerts a force on object B, object B exerts an equal and opposite force on object A (action-reaction pairs).

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Describes Newton's three laws qualitatively: objects remain at rest or constant velocity unless acted on by a force, force causes acceleration, and every action has an equal and opposite reaction. | Stating the action-reaction pair is weight and normal force (these act on the same object — not a Newton's third law pair); Believing that an object at rest has no forces acting on it, rather than recognising balanced forces |
| **Developing** | Applies F = ma to calculate force, mass, or acceleration. Draws and interprets free body diagrams showing all forces on an object. Uses Newton's third law to identify action-reaction force pairs acting on different objects. | Forgetting to calculate acceleration first and trying to use F = mv instead of F = ma; Not distinguishing between the driving force (from the engine) and the resultant force (driving force minus friction and air resistance) |
| **Secure** | Applies Newton's laws to multi-force problems including friction, air resistance, and terminal velocity. Interprets velocity-time graphs to determine acceleration and resultant force. Analyses the forces during real scenarios such as skydiving and braking. | Stating that air resistance is constant rather than velocity-dependent; Drawing the v-t graph with a sharp corner at terminal velocity rather than a smooth curve approaching the plateau |
| **Mastery** | Applies Newton's laws to complex and unfamiliar situations, evaluates the assumptions in simplified models, resolves forces on inclined planes, and analyses real-world applications including vehicle safety and space travel. | Using mg instead of mg cos θ for the normal reaction force on an inclined plane; Forgetting to include air resistance as an additional force that becomes significant at higher speeds |

### Secondary concept: Electromagnetic Spectrum (PH-KS4-C011)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The electromagnetic spectrum is a continuous range of transverse waves that all travel at the same speed in a vacuum (3 × 10⁸ m/s). From longest to shortest wavelength: radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, gamma rays. Higher frequency EM waves carry more energy per photon. Ionising radiation (X-rays, gamma rays, high-energy UV) can cause ionisation of atoms, damage DNA and increase the risk of cancer.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Names the main regions of the electromagnetic spectrum in order of wavelength or frequency and gives one use for each. | Placing the types in the wrong order or omitting one region; Confusing microwaves with radio waves or ultraviolet with X-rays |
| **Developing** | Describes how all electromagnetic waves are transverse, travel at the speed of light in a vacuum, and differ only in wavelength and frequency. Relates wave properties to uses and hazards. | Stating that higher frequency waves travel faster — all EM waves have the same speed in a vacuum; Confusing the properties of EM waves with sound waves (e.g. stating EM waves are longitudinal) |
| **Secure** | Explains the hazards of different EM radiations at a cellular level (ionisation, heating), evaluates the balance of risk and benefit for medical and industrial uses, and applies the relationship between frequency, wavelength, and energy to explain penetration and absorption. | Stating that X-rays are 'safe' for medical use without discussing risk minimisation; Not explaining why ionising radiation damages cells — it is the ionisation of DNA molecules, not just general 'damage' |
| **Mastery** | Analyses applications across the full EM spectrum in unfamiliar contexts, evaluates competing technologies, and discusses the physics behind detection methods, atmospheric absorption windows, and the social implications of EM technology. | Not explaining why the atmosphere blocks certain wavelengths (absorption by gases such as ozone for UV, water vapour for IR); Treating all telescopes as equivalent rather than recognising that different wavelengths require different detection technologies |

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** Sorting, classifying and identifying similarities directly trains pupils to recognise regularities and use them to predict or generalise.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- How would you formalise this pattern mathematically?
- What are the limits of this pattern — where does it break down?
- Could this pattern be an artefact of how the data was collected?
- Does identifying the pattern tell us why it occurs?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Drawing conclusions from observations requires constructing a claim supported by specific evidence — not just describing what was seen.

---

## Session structure: Fair Test

### Fair Test
The classic scientific enquiry: formulating a testable question, making a prediction based on scientific understanding, designing a method that controls variables, collecting and recording data systematically, analysing results, and drawing a conclusion linked back to the original hypothesis.

`question` → `hypothesis` → `method` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `conclusion`

**Assessment:** Structured scientific report including question, hypothesis with reasoning, method with variables identified, results table/graph, and conclusion evaluating whether results support the hypothesis.

**Teacher note:** Use the FAIR TEST template: expect pupils to derive a testable hypothesis from scientific theory and design a rigorous method with appropriate controls, precision, and sample size. Guide analysis using statistical techniques or mathematical modelling where appropriate. Demand critical evaluation of validity, reliability, accuracy, and the extent to which results support or refute the hypothesis.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does your hypothesis follow from the underlying scientific theory?
- How have you ensured sufficient precision, accuracy, and reliability in your method?
- What statistical analysis supports your conclusion?
- To what extent do your results support the hypothesis, and what are the limitations?

## Variables

**Independent:** wave property being investigated (barrier position for reflection, water depth for refraction, gap width for diffraction)
**Dependent:** observed wave pattern and measured wavelength/speed
**Controlled:** frequency of dipper, water depth (except for refraction), motor speed

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- ripple tank with motor and dipper
- lamp (overhead or stroboscope)
- white paper screen (below tank)
- ruler
- stopwatch
- straight barrier
- curved barrier
- shallow region insert (for refraction)
- gap barriers of different widths (for diffraction)

**Safety notes:** Water and electricity in close proximity — ensure the ripple tank motor is properly insulated and connected to a low-voltage supply. Mop up any spills immediately. The stroboscope can trigger photosensitive epilepsy — check with pupils before use and have an alternative available. Do not look directly at the stroboscope light. (Hazard level: low)

---

## Expected outcome

Pupils observe wave behaviour: reflection (angle of incidence = angle of reflection), refraction (waves change speed and direction when entering shallow water), and diffraction (waves spread through gaps, with maximum diffraction when gap width ≈ wavelength). They measure wavelength from the projected wave pattern and calculate wave speed using v = fλ. The relationship between gap width and diffraction demonstrates that wave effects are most pronounced when obstacles are similar in size to the wavelength.

**Recording format:** annotated diagrams of reflection, refraction, and diffraction patterns, wavelength measurements from projected pattern, wave speed calculation using v = fλ, comparison table of wave behaviours

---

## Enquiry type

### Fair Test
A controlled investigation where one variable is deliberately changed while all others are kept the same, to determine whether the changed variable has an effect on a measured outcome. The gold-standard enquiry type for causal questions in science.

**Question stems:**
- How does [independent variable] affect [dependent variable]?
- Does changing [variable] make a difference to [outcome]?
- What is the relationship between [variable A] and [variable B]?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What will you change? (independent variable)
- What will you measure or observe? (dependent variable)
- What will you keep the same? (controlled variables)
- What do you predict will happen? Why?
- Was your prediction correct? What does the evidence show?

### Observation Over Time
A systematic enquiry where changes are observed and recorded at intervals over a period of time — hours, days, weeks, or longer. Used when the process being studied is too slow for a single lesson or when the pattern only emerges through repeated observation. Develops patience, systematic recording, and the ability to identify trends.

**Question stems:**
- How does [thing being observed] change over time?
- What happens to [variable] over [time period]?
- What pattern can you see in how [process] changes?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What do you think will happen over time? Why?
- How often should we observe and record?
- What exactly will we look for or measure each time?
- What pattern can you see in the observations?
- Can you explain why this pattern happens?

## Known misconceptions

### Sound travels through vacuum
**What pupils may say:** Sound can travel through space (a vacuum).
**Correct explanation:** Sound is a vibration that needs a medium (solid, liquid, or gas) to travel through. In a vacuum, there are no particles to vibrate, so sound cannot travel. This is why space is silent. Light can travel through a vacuum, but sound cannot — they are fundamentally different types of wave.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- Can astronauts hear each other talking in space without radios? Why not?
- What does sound need in order to travel from one place to another?
- What is the difference between how light and sound travel?


---

## Why this study matters

The ripple tank makes invisible wave phenomena visible. Projected wave patterns allow direct observation and measurement of reflection, refraction, and diffraction — concepts that are otherwise abstract. The investigation naturally leads to the wave equation v = fλ through measurement. Comparing diffraction through different gap widths develops understanding of a key principle: waves interact most strongly with objects of similar size to their wavelength. This principle transfers directly to understanding why radio waves diffract around hills while light does not.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. The water surface is disturbed by external vibrations — ensure the bench is stable and pupils do not lean on the tank
2. Pupils confuse wavelength (distance between adjacent wave crests) with amplitude (maximum displacement) — use clear diagrams
3. Difficulty measuring wavelength from the projected pattern — measure across several wavelengths and divide to improve accuracy

## Sensitive content

- Stroboscopes can trigger photosensitive epilepsy — check medical records and provide alternative observation methods if needed
