## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Weather and Climate (GE-KS1-C003)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Weather describes the atmospheric conditions at a specific place and time - whether it is sunny, rainy, windy or cloudy - while climate describes the typical or average weather pattern of a place over a longer period. At KS1, pupils observe and record daily and seasonal weather patterns in the UK, developing understanding of why weather varies through the day and through the year. The relationship between latitude and temperature - how places nearer the Equator are generally warmer than places nearer the Poles - provides the foundational explanation for global climate variation.

**Teaching guidance:** Carry out regular weather observation and recording: daily weather symbols, temperature readings, rainfall records. Create weather diaries and simple graphs over time. Discuss seasonal patterns: what is different in winter and summer? Use photographs from around the world to explore how climate varies with latitude. Connect to the Equator and Poles on a globe to explain why some places are hot (near Equator) and some cold (near Poles). Relate weather to people's activities: how do seasonal changes affect farming, clothing, outdoor activities?

**Key vocabulary:** weather, climate, season, spring, summer, autumn, winter, temperature, rainfall, sunshine, wind, cloud, forecast, Equator, poles, latitude, hot, cold, warm, cool

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often confuse weather and climate. Using the phrase 'weather is what you get, climate is what you expect' helps establish the distinction. Pupils may think the UK has no summer or no winter based on extreme contrasts with other countries; a nuanced discussion of the UK's temperate climate is needed. The relationship between latitude and temperature can seem counterintuitive when placed on a flat map; a globe makes this relationship much clearer.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Describing the current weather using simple vocabulary (sunny, rainy, cloudy, windy, cold, hot) and identifying the current season. | Look outside. What is the weather like today? What season is it? | Not being able to name the current season; Using only one weather word when multiple apply (e.g. it can be windy AND cold) |
| **Developing** | Describing seasonal weather patterns in the UK, explaining what kind of weather is typical in each season. | What is the weather usually like in summer in the UK? How is it different from winter? | Describing one day's weather as representing a whole season; Thinking it never rains in summer or is never sunny in winter |
| **Expected** | Comparing weather patterns in the UK with weather in another location, and beginning to explain why places have different weather. | Compare the weather in our town with the weather in a hot country like Kenya. Why might they be different? | Assuming all hot countries have the same weather pattern; Not connecting weather differences to geographical location |

> **Model response (Entry):** *It is cloudy and cold today. It is winter.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *In summer it is usually warmer and the days are longer. We get more sunshine. In winter it is colder, the days are shorter, and we get more rain and sometimes snow.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Our town has four seasons with cold winters and mild summers. Kenya is near the Equator so it is hot all year round. Kenya has a wet season and a dry season instead of our four seasons. The weather is different because Kenya is closer to the Equator where the sun is more directly overhead.*

### Secondary concept: World Geography: Continents and Oceans (GE-KS1-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

The Earth's surface is divided into seven large landmasses called continents (Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia/Oceania, Europe, North America, South America) and five major oceans (Arctic, Atlantic, Indian, Pacific, Southern). These are the fundamental units of world geography, providing the spatial framework within which countries, cities and physical features are located. At KS1, pupils learn to name, locate and recall these major global features, building the mental map that underpins all subsequent geographical learning.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Naming at least three continents and two oceans when shown them on a globe or world map. | Confusing continents with countries (e.g. calling Africa a country); Not being able to distinguish between land (continents) and water (oceans) on a map |
| **Developing** | Naming and locating all seven continents and five oceans on a world map, and identifying which continent the UK is on. | Confusing North America and South America or placing them incorrectly; Forgetting Antarctica or the Southern Ocean |
| **Expected** | Locating continents and oceans on a world map and describing their relative positions using directional language (north, south, east, west). | Using 'up' and 'down' instead of compass directions; Placing oceans incorrectly because of map projection distortion |
| **Greater Depth** | Using knowledge of continents and oceans to locate unfamiliar countries or features, and explaining why the equator, poles and tropics are significant. | Not understanding that the Equator divides the world into hemispheres; Assuming all of a continent has the same climate |

### Secondary concept: Maps, Atlases and Globes (GE-KS1-C005)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Maps, atlases and globes are the primary tools geographers use to represent and communicate spatial information. A map is a flat, symbolic representation of a part of the Earth's surface; an atlas is a collection of maps in book form; a globe is a three-dimensional spherical representation. Each has different advantages: globes accurately show the relative sizes of continents and the shape of the Earth, while maps are more portable and convenient for showing detailed information. At KS1, pupils learn to use and interpret each type of representation, developing their ability to extract locational information.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Using a simple map or plan to identify features, understanding that a map represents a real place from above. | Not understanding that the map shows a 'bird's eye view' from above; Confusing left and right on a map with left and right in the room |
| **Developing** | Using a simple key to read a map and using basic compass directions (north, south, east, west) to describe where things are. | Not using the key and guessing what symbols mean; Confusing compass directions, especially east and west |
| **Expected** | Using maps, atlases and globes to locate places and features, constructing simple maps with a key, title and compass directions. | Drawing a picture rather than a map (showing walls from the side, not from above); Forgetting to include a key to explain the symbols used |

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** Recognising where continents and oceans sit relative to one another introduces pattern recognition in spatial distribution, laying the groundwork for later understanding of why populations and climates are distributed as they are.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What is the same about these?
- What is different?
- What comes next?
- Can you sort these into groups?

**Secondary lens:** Scale, Proportion and Quantity — The cognitive demand here is zooming between scales — from the global (continents, oceans) to the national (UK nations and capitals) — requiring pupils to hold nested spatial relationships in mind and understand that the same world can be described at different levels of granularity.

## Session structure: Topic Study

### Topic Study
A structured enquiry into a defined topic, period, or place. Begins with an engaging hook to capture interest, builds contextual knowledge, moves through source analysis and interpretation, and culminates in a substantiated argument or conclusion. The core humanities template.

`hook` → `context` → `source_analysis` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Extended writing task presenting a reasoned argument supported by evidence from the topic. Can take the form of an essay, structured explanation, or debate position.

**Teacher note:** Use the TOPIC STUDY template: begin with a simple hook that captures children's curiosity — a picture, an object, or a short story. Provide context through visual and sensory experiences. Guide children to look at one source closely, describing what they can see. Ask them to say what they think it tells us, using 'I think... because...' sentences.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What can you see in this picture?
- What do you think this tells us about life long ago?
- What is the same as today? What is different?
- How do you know? What clues can you spot?

## Why this study matters

This statutory topic introduces the foundational relationship between location and climate: places near the Equator are generally hot, places near the Poles are generally cold, and the UK's temperate position produces distinct seasonal patterns. Observing daily and seasonal weather gives pupils direct, experiential evidence for geographical patterns, while the global dimension (hot and cold places) extends their mental map and connects to the Equator and Poles as key geographical concepts.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Confusing weather (what is happening today) with climate (what typically happens) — use the distinction explicitly and repeatedly
2. Teaching hot and cold places only from flat maps — a globe makes the Equator-Poles relationship much clearer
3. Presenting UK seasons as identical to all temperate places — note that seasons vary in different countries

---

## Success criteria

**Pupils can:**
- Describe typical weather for each of the four UK seasons
- Use a globe to show the Equator and Poles
- Explain that places near the Equator are hot and places near the Poles are cold

## Geographical skills (KS1)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Using maps, atlases and globes** — Locating and identifying places in the United Kingdom and wider world using world maps, atlases and globes as reference tools, understanding that these are representations of the real world at reduced scale.
- **Using compass directions and locational language** — Applying the four cardinal compass directions (North, South, East, West) and everyday directional language such as near, far, left and right to describe the location of features and routes on maps and in the environment.
- **Using aerial photographs and making simple maps** — Interpreting aerial photographs and plan-perspective images to recognise landmarks and physical and human features, and translating these observations into a simple hand-drawn map with a basic symbol key.
- **Simple fieldwork and observational skills** — Going out into the school grounds and immediate surrounding environment to observe, describe and record human and physical geographical features at first hand, practising the habits of direct geographical enquiry.
- **Using maps, atlases, globes and digital mapping** — Extending atlas and map use to locate countries and describe the features studied across the curriculum, and beginning to use digital and computer mapping tools — including online satellite maps — to access geographical information in a range of formats.
- **Eight-point compass and Ordnance Survey map skills** — Applying the eight compass points, four-figure and six-figure grid references, and the symbols and conventions of Ordnance Survey maps to build knowledge of the UK and the wider world, and to navigate and locate features on topographic maps.
