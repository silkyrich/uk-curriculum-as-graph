## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: World Geography: Continents and Oceans (GE-KS1-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

The Earth's surface is divided into seven large landmasses called continents (Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia/Oceania, Europe, North America, South America) and five major oceans (Arctic, Atlantic, Indian, Pacific, Southern). These are the fundamental units of world geography, providing the spatial framework within which countries, cities and physical features are located. At KS1, pupils learn to name, locate and recall these major global features, building the mental map that underpins all subsequent geographical learning.

**Teaching guidance:** Use large world maps and globes regularly. Teach continent and ocean names through songs, chants and repeated mapping activities. Use a globe to reinforce the spherical nature of the Earth and why the Equator, Poles and Tropics matter. Play games where pupils place labels on unlabelled world maps. Connect continents to relevant contexts: which continent is our school in? Which ocean would you cross to get to Australia? Use aerial and satellite images to show what continents look like from space.

**Key vocabulary:** continent, ocean, Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, South America, Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Arctic, Southern, globe, world map

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may confuse countries with continents, for example thinking 'Africa' is a country. Regular comparison of political and physical maps helps clarify the distinction. The status of Australia as both a continent and a country causes confusion; explicit teaching of this as a special case is needed. Pupils may not understand that the Equator divides the globe into hemispheres; connecting this to temperature zones makes it meaningful.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Naming at least three continents and two oceans when shown them on a globe or world map. | Point to and name three continents on this world map. | Confusing continents with countries (e.g. calling Africa a country); Not being able to distinguish between land (continents) and water (oceans) on a map |
| **Developing** | Naming and locating all seven continents and five oceans on a world map, and identifying which continent the UK is on. | Label all seven continents on this blank world map. Which continent is the United Kingdom on? | Confusing North America and South America or placing them incorrectly; Forgetting Antarctica or the Southern Ocean |
| **Expected** | Locating continents and oceans on a world map and describing their relative positions using directional language (north, south, east, west). | Where is Africa in relation to Europe? Where is the Pacific Ocean? | Using 'up' and 'down' instead of compass directions; Placing oceans incorrectly because of map projection distortion |
| **Greater Depth** | Using knowledge of continents and oceans to locate unfamiliar countries or features, and explaining why the equator, poles and tropics are significant. | Brazil is in South America. Using the map, describe where South America is in relation to the Equator and the two closest oceans. | Not understanding that the Equator divides the world into hemispheres; Assuming all of a continent has the same climate |

> **Model response (Entry):** *This is Africa, this is Europe, and this is Asia.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, South America. The United Kingdom is in Europe.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Africa is south of Europe, separated by the Mediterranean Sea. The Pacific Ocean is the largest ocean and is between Asia and the Americas, on the east side of Asia.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *South America crosses the Equator, so it is in both the northern and southern hemispheres. The Atlantic Ocean is to its east and the Pacific Ocean is to its west. Because it crosses the Equator, the northern part is tropical and warm.*

### Secondary concept: Maps, Atlases and Globes (GE-KS1-C005)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Maps, atlases and globes are the primary tools geographers use to represent and communicate spatial information. A map is a flat, symbolic representation of a part of the Earth's surface; an atlas is a collection of maps in book form; a globe is a three-dimensional spherical representation. Each has different advantages: globes accurately show the relative sizes of continents and the shape of the Earth, while maps are more portable and convenient for showing detailed information. At KS1, pupils learn to use and interpret each type of representation, developing their ability to extract locational information.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Using a simple map or plan to identify features, understanding that a map represents a real place from above. | Not understanding that the map shows a 'bird's eye view' from above; Confusing left and right on a map with left and right in the room |
| **Developing** | Using a simple key to read a map and using basic compass directions (north, south, east, west) to describe where things are. | Not using the key and guessing what symbols mean; Confusing compass directions, especially east and west |
| **Expected** | Using maps, atlases and globes to locate places and features, constructing simple maps with a key, title and compass directions. | Drawing a picture rather than a map (showing walls from the side, not from above); Forgetting to include a key to explain the symbols used |

## Thinking lens: Scale, Proportion and Quantity (primary)

**Key question:** How big, how many, or how much — and how does that change how we think about it?

**Why this lens fits:** The cognitive demand here is zooming between scales — from the global (continents, oceans) to the national (UK nations and capitals) — requiring pupils to hold nested spatial relationships in mind and understand that the same world can be described at different levels of granularity.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- Which one is bigger?
- Which group has more?
- How could we check which is heavier?
- Is this a lot or a little?

**Secondary lens:** Patterns — Recognising where continents and oceans sit relative to one another introduces pattern recognition in spatial distribution, laying the groundwork for later understanding of why populations and climates are distributed as they are.

## Session structure: Topic Study

### Topic Study
A structured enquiry into a defined topic, period, or place. Begins with an engaging hook to capture interest, builds contextual knowledge, moves through source analysis and interpretation, and culminates in a substantiated argument or conclusion. The core humanities template.

`hook` → `context` → `source_analysis` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Extended writing task presenting a reasoned argument supported by evidence from the topic. Can take the form of an essay, structured explanation, or debate position.

**Teacher note:** Use the TOPIC STUDY template: begin with a simple hook that captures children's curiosity — a picture, an object, or a short story. Provide context through visual and sensory experiences. Guide children to look at one source closely, describing what they can see. Ask them to say what they think it tells us, using 'I think... because...' sentences.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What can you see in this picture?
- What do you think this tells us about life long ago?
- What is the same as today? What is different?
- How do you know? What clues can you spot?

## Why this study matters

Naming and locating the seven continents and five oceans is a statutory KS1 requirement that builds the global spatial framework underpinning all subsequent geography. At this age, the emphasis is on building a mental map of the world at the broadest scale — recognising that the Earth is made up of large landmasses surrounded by named oceans — which gives children the vocabulary and spatial scaffolding to make sense of places they encounter in stories, news, and travel.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Treating this as a one-off labelling exercise rather than revisiting regularly to build secure recall
2. Confusing countries with continents (e.g. thinking Africa is a country) — use maps that show both
3. Only using flat maps — globes are essential for understanding the spherical Earth and relative sizes of continents

---

## Success criteria

**Pupils can:**
- Name and locate all 7 continents on a world map or globe
- Name and locate at least 3 of the 5 oceans
- Explain that continents are large landmasses and oceans are large bodies of water

## Geographical skills (KS1)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Using maps, atlases and globes** — Locating and identifying places in the United Kingdom and wider world using world maps, atlases and globes as reference tools, understanding that these are representations of the real world at reduced scale.
- **Using compass directions and locational language** — Applying the four cardinal compass directions (North, South, East, West) and everyday directional language such as near, far, left and right to describe the location of features and routes on maps and in the environment.
- **Using aerial photographs and making simple maps** — Interpreting aerial photographs and plan-perspective images to recognise landmarks and physical and human features, and translating these observations into a simple hand-drawn map with a basic symbol key.
- **Simple fieldwork and observational skills** — Going out into the school grounds and immediate surrounding environment to observe, describe and record human and physical geographical features at first hand, practising the habits of direct geographical enquiry.
- **Using maps, atlases, globes and digital mapping** — Extending atlas and map use to locate countries and describe the features studied across the curriculum, and beginning to use digital and computer mapping tools — including online satellite maps — to access geographical information in a range of formats.
- **Eight-point compass and Ordnance Survey map skills** — Applying the eight compass points, four-figure and six-figure grid references, and the symbols and conventions of Ordnance Survey maps to build knowledge of the UK and the wider world, and to navigate and locate features on topographic maps.
