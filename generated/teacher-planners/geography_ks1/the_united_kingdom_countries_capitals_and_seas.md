## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: United Kingdom: Countries and Capitals (GE-KS1-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

The United Kingdom is a political union comprising four countries: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, each with its own capital city (London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast respectively). The UK is surrounded by the North Sea, English Channel, Irish Sea and Atlantic Ocean. At KS1, pupils learn to identify the four countries, their capitals and their positions within the UK, alongside awareness of the surrounding seas.

**Teaching guidance:** Use maps of the UK regularly, pointing out and naming the four countries and their capitals. Make connections to pupils' own location: which country do we live in? What is our capital? Use physical outline maps for pupils to label. Connect to current events and news that reference specific UK countries. Explore the flags of the four countries and the Union Flag. Link to the surrounding seas by tracing routes on maps.

**Key vocabulary:** United Kingdom, England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, London, Edinburgh, Cardiff, Belfast, capital, country, border, sea, coast, English Channel, North Sea, Irish Sea, Atlantic

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils frequently confuse England with the United Kingdom and with Britain. Deliberate and consistent use of precise terms - UK, Britain, Great Britain, England - with clear definitions addresses this. Some pupils may not know that Northern Ireland is part of the UK; using maps that clearly show all four countries together prevents this misunderstanding.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Naming the four countries of the United Kingdom and identifying at least one capital city. | What are the four countries in the United Kingdom? What is the capital of England? | Including Ireland (the Republic) as part of the UK; Confusing England with the United Kingdom |
| **Developing** | Naming all four countries and their capital cities, and locating them on a map of the United Kingdom. | Point to each country on this UK map and name its capital city. | Confusing Edinburgh with Glasgow for Scotland's capital; Not being able to distinguish the country boundaries on a map |
| **Expected** | Describing the position of countries and their capital cities using compass directions and identifying surrounding seas. | Describe where Scotland is in relation to England. What seas surround the UK? | Confusing the names of surrounding seas; Using 'above' and 'below' instead of compass directions |

> **Model response (Entry):** *England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The capital of England is London.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *England — London, Scotland — Edinburgh, Wales — Cardiff, Northern Ireland — Belfast.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Scotland is north of England. They share a border. The UK is surrounded by the North Sea to the east, the English Channel to the south, the Irish Sea between Britain and Ireland, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west.*

### Secondary concept: World Geography: Continents and Oceans (GE-KS1-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

The Earth's surface is divided into seven large landmasses called continents (Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia/Oceania, Europe, North America, South America) and five major oceans (Arctic, Atlantic, Indian, Pacific, Southern). These are the fundamental units of world geography, providing the spatial framework within which countries, cities and physical features are located. At KS1, pupils learn to name, locate and recall these major global features, building the mental map that underpins all subsequent geographical learning.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Naming at least three continents and two oceans when shown them on a globe or world map. | Confusing continents with countries (e.g. calling Africa a country); Not being able to distinguish between land (continents) and water (oceans) on a map |
| **Developing** | Naming and locating all seven continents and five oceans on a world map, and identifying which continent the UK is on. | Confusing North America and South America or placing them incorrectly; Forgetting Antarctica or the Southern Ocean |
| **Expected** | Locating continents and oceans on a world map and describing their relative positions using directional language (north, south, east, west). | Using 'up' and 'down' instead of compass directions; Placing oceans incorrectly because of map projection distortion |
| **Greater Depth** | Using knowledge of continents and oceans to locate unfamiliar countries or features, and explaining why the equator, poles and tropics are significant. | Not understanding that the Equator divides the world into hemispheres; Assuming all of a continent has the same climate |

### Secondary concept: Maps, Atlases and Globes (GE-KS1-C005)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Maps, atlases and globes are the primary tools geographers use to represent and communicate spatial information. A map is a flat, symbolic representation of a part of the Earth's surface; an atlas is a collection of maps in book form; a globe is a three-dimensional spherical representation. Each has different advantages: globes accurately show the relative sizes of continents and the shape of the Earth, while maps are more portable and convenient for showing detailed information. At KS1, pupils learn to use and interpret each type of representation, developing their ability to extract locational information.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Using a simple map or plan to identify features, understanding that a map represents a real place from above. | Not understanding that the map shows a 'bird's eye view' from above; Confusing left and right on a map with left and right in the room |
| **Developing** | Using a simple key to read a map and using basic compass directions (north, south, east, west) to describe where things are. | Not using the key and guessing what symbols mean; Confusing compass directions, especially east and west |
| **Expected** | Using maps, atlases and globes to locate places and features, constructing simple maps with a key, title and compass directions. | Drawing a picture rather than a map (showing walls from the side, not from above); Forgetting to include a key to explain the symbols used |

## Thinking lens: Scale, Proportion and Quantity (primary)

**Key question:** How big, how many, or how much — and how does that change how we think about it?

**Why this lens fits:** The cognitive demand here is zooming between scales — from the global (continents, oceans) to the national (UK nations and capitals) — requiring pupils to hold nested spatial relationships in mind and understand that the same world can be described at different levels of granularity.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- Which one is bigger?
- Which group has more?
- How could we check which is heavier?
- Is this a lot or a little?

**Secondary lens:** Patterns — Recognising where continents and oceans sit relative to one another introduces pattern recognition in spatial distribution, laying the groundwork for later understanding of why populations and climates are distributed as they are.

## Session structure: Topic Study

### Topic Study
A structured enquiry into a defined topic, period, or place. Begins with an engaging hook to capture interest, builds contextual knowledge, moves through source analysis and interpretation, and culminates in a substantiated argument or conclusion. The core humanities template.

`hook` → `context` → `source_analysis` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Extended writing task presenting a reasoned argument supported by evidence from the topic. Can take the form of an essay, structured explanation, or debate position.

**Teacher note:** Use the TOPIC STUDY template: begin with a simple hook that captures children's curiosity — a picture, an object, or a short story. Provide context through visual and sensory experiences. Guide children to look at one source closely, describing what they can see. Ask them to say what they think it tells us, using 'I think... because...' sentences.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What can you see in this picture?
- What do you think this tells us about life long ago?
- What is the same as today? What is different?
- How do you know? What clues can you spot?

## Study scope

**Scale:** National
**Themes:** locational knowledge, political geography, national identity

**Map types:** uk political map, labelling map, simple plan
**Data sources:** Atlas, Wall maps, Globe

## Locations

### United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (United Kingdom, Europe, country, national)
**Development context:** HIC
**Key physical features:** Pennines, Lake District, Scottish Highlands, River Thames, coastline
**Key human features:** London, four constituent countries, parliamentary democracy, 66 million population


---

## Why this study matters

Locational knowledge of the UK is a statutory requirement that gives pupils their first detailed political geography, understanding that the United Kingdom is made up of four countries each with its own capital, surrounded by named seas. This concrete, mappable knowledge provides the spatial framework for all subsequent UK geography and connects to pupils' sense of national and regional identity.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Confusing England with the United Kingdom — deliberate, consistent use of precise terminology is essential
2. Teaching location names without using maps — names must be anchored to spatial positions
3. Treating this as rote memorisation rather than building genuine spatial understanding through repeated map use

---

## Success criteria

**Pupils can:**
- Name and locate England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland on a UK map
- Name the capital city of each UK country
- Name at least 2 surrounding seas

## Geographical skills (KS1)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Using maps, atlases and globes** — Locating and identifying places in the United Kingdom and wider world using world maps, atlases and globes as reference tools, understanding that these are representations of the real world at reduced scale.
- **Using compass directions and locational language** — Applying the four cardinal compass directions (North, South, East, West) and everyday directional language such as near, far, left and right to describe the location of features and routes on maps and in the environment.
- **Using aerial photographs and making simple maps** — Interpreting aerial photographs and plan-perspective images to recognise landmarks and physical and human features, and translating these observations into a simple hand-drawn map with a basic symbol key.
- **Simple fieldwork and observational skills** — Going out into the school grounds and immediate surrounding environment to observe, describe and record human and physical geographical features at first hand, practising the habits of direct geographical enquiry.
- **Using maps, atlases, globes and digital mapping** — Extending atlas and map use to locate countries and describe the features studied across the curriculum, and beginning to use digital and computer mapping tools — including online satellite maps — to access geographical information in a range of formats.
- **Eight-point compass and Ordnance Survey map skills** — Applying the eight compass points, four-figure and six-figure grid references, and the symbols and conventions of Ordnance Survey maps to build knowledge of the UK and the wider world, and to navigate and locate features on topographic maps.
