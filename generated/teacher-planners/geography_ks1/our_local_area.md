## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Physical and Human Features (GE-KS1-C004)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Geography categorises features of the world into physical features - those created by natural processes including landforms, water bodies and vegetation - and human features - those created by people including settlements, buildings and land uses. At KS1, pupils learn the key vocabulary for both types of feature, developing the language to describe and categorise the world around them and in studied places. Understanding the distinction between physical and human geography is foundational to the discipline.

**Teaching guidance:** Use photographs of local and distant places to identify and classify physical and human features. Sort feature cards into physical and human categories. Take pupils outdoors to observe and name physical and human features in the school environment and local area. Use the vocabulary list actively: say and write the words alongside images. Connect vocabulary to pupils' direct experience: 'We live in a city/town/village' - which is our human feature? What physical features can we see from the window?

**Key vocabulary:** beach, cliff, coast, forest, hill, mountain, sea, ocean, river, soil, valley, vegetation, city, town, village, factory, farm, house, office, port, harbour, shop, physical, human, feature, landscape

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may find the distinction between physical and human features unclear for some cases - a canal is human but a river is physical; a park could be either. Discussing borderline cases develops more sophisticated understanding. Pupils may not recognise common local features as 'geographical' until they are pointed out and named. Building observation skills through regular local fieldwork develops geographical awareness.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying whether a feature is physical (natural) or human (made by people) when given examples. | Sort these into physical features and human features: river, bridge, hill, shop, forest, road. | Classifying a park as physical because it has grass and trees; Not understanding what 'physical feature' means in a geography context |
| **Developing** | Using geographical vocabulary to describe physical and human features observed in the local area or in photographs of places. | Look at this photograph of a seaside town. Describe the physical features and human features you can see. | Describing features without using specific geographical vocabulary; Overlooking less obvious features (e.g. a harbour wall is human-made) |
| **Expected** | Explaining the relationship between physical and human features — how the physical landscape influences what humans build and do there. | Why do you think this town was built next to the river? How do the physical features affect the human features? | Describing physical and human features separately without explaining connections; Not recognising that physical geography influences where and how people live |

> **Model response (Entry):** *Physical: river, hill, forest. Human: bridge, shop, road.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Physical features: cliffs, the sea, a sandy beach, rocks. Human features: houses along the seafront, a pier, a car park, a lighthouse.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *The town was built by the river because people needed water for drinking, farming and transport. The flat land near the river was good for building on. The bridge was built because people needed to cross the river. The physical features — the river and flat land — helped decide where the human features would go.*

### Secondary concept: Maps, Atlases and Globes (GE-KS1-C005)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Maps, atlases and globes are the primary tools geographers use to represent and communicate spatial information. A map is a flat, symbolic representation of a part of the Earth's surface; an atlas is a collection of maps in book form; a globe is a three-dimensional spherical representation. Each has different advantages: globes accurately show the relative sizes of continents and the shape of the Earth, while maps are more portable and convenient for showing detailed information. At KS1, pupils learn to use and interpret each type of representation, developing their ability to extract locational information.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Using a simple map or plan to identify features, understanding that a map represents a real place from above. | Not understanding that the map shows a 'bird's eye view' from above; Confusing left and right on a map with left and right in the room |
| **Developing** | Using a simple key to read a map and using basic compass directions (north, south, east, west) to describe where things are. | Not using the key and guessing what symbols mean; Confusing compass directions, especially east and west |
| **Expected** | Using maps, atlases and globes to locate places and features, constructing simple maps with a key, title and compass directions. | Drawing a picture rather than a map (showing walls from the side, not from above); Forgetting to include a key to explain the symbols used |

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** Seasonal weather cycles are the most accessible example of recurring natural patterns that pupils can observe directly; recognising the repeating sequence of seasons is the entry point for understanding cyclical physical processes.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What is the same about these?
- What is different?
- What comes next?
- Can you sort these into groups?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Maps and atlases are geographical evidence tools; using them to answer locational questions requires pupils to interrogate a source, interpret its symbols and conventions, and draw spatial conclusions — the same evidence-to-claim reasoning that underpins geographical argument.

## Session structure: Place Study

### Place Study
An in-depth geographical study of a specific place at local, national, or global scale. Pupils orient themselves within the place, use maps and spatial data, collect information about its physical and human features, analyse geographical processes, compare with other places, and evaluate change or issues.

`orientation` → `mapping` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `comparison` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Place study report combining map work, data presentation, descriptive and explanatory writing about geographical features and processes, and comparative or evaluative conclusion.

**Teacher note:** Use the PLACE STUDY template: help children find out about a place by looking at pictures, maps, and stories from there. Guide them to describe what the place is like using simple geographical words — hot, cold, hilly, flat, busy, quiet. Compare it with where they live. Encourage them to say what is the same and what is different.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What is this place like?
- Where is it? Can you find it on the map?
- What is the same as where we live? What is different?
- Would you like to visit this place? Why or why not?

## Study scope

**Scale:** Local
**Themes:** local geography, observation, human and physical features, place knowledge

**Map types:** simple plan, picture map, aerial photo
**Data sources:** Pupil observation, Local photographs, Google Earth

**Fieldwork potential:** Walking survey of the school grounds and immediate surroundings, observing and recording human and physical features using simple tally charts and sketch maps.

**Assessment guidance:** Can pupils identify and name human and physical features in their local area? Can they use a simple map or plan to show where features are located? Can they describe what makes their local area distinctive?

## Locations

### School Locality (United Kingdom, Europe, locality, local)
**Development context:** HIC
**Suggested exemplars:** Village in Hampshire, Estate in Manchester, Town in Yorkshire, Suburb in Birmingham
**Key physical features:** Determined by school location
**Key human features:** Determined by school location


---

## Contrasting localities

### UK Locality vs Non-European Locality
The NC mandates that KS1 pupils compare a UK locality with a non-European locality to develop early comparative geographical thinking and openness to diverse human geographies. The contrast must balance genuine differences (climate, landscape, economy) with fundamental similarities (children go to school, families share meals, people work and play) to prevent othering.

**Compare through:** climate, settlement type, daily life, physical features, economic activity
**Stimulus questions:**
- How is the other place the same as our area? How is it different?
- What do children in the other place do that is the same as what you do?
- What does the landscape look like? Is it the same as ours or different?
- What is the weather like there? How does it compare to our weather?

## Why this study matters

The local area study is the starting point for geographical enquiry at KS1, grounding abstract concepts in direct experience. Pupils observe, describe, and map the human and physical features of their immediate environment, building the observational and descriptive vocabulary that underpins all subsequent geography. The school determines which local area to study, making this universally relevant.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Treating the local study as a one-off activity rather than returning to it throughout the year as new concepts are learned
2. Focusing only on human features (buildings, shops) and neglecting physical features (rivers, hills, vegetation) in the local area
3. Not connecting the local study to the contrasting non-European locality — the two should be taught in dialogue

---

## Success criteria

**Pupils can:**
- Name at least 3 physical features and 3 human features in the local area
- Use a simple plan or sketch map to show where features are located
- Describe what makes the local area similar to or different from other places

## Geographical skills (KS1)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Using maps, atlases and globes** — Locating and identifying places in the United Kingdom and wider world using world maps, atlases and globes as reference tools, understanding that these are representations of the real world at reduced scale.
- **Using compass directions and locational language** — Applying the four cardinal compass directions (North, South, East, West) and everyday directional language such as near, far, left and right to describe the location of features and routes on maps and in the environment.
- **Using aerial photographs and making simple maps** — Interpreting aerial photographs and plan-perspective images to recognise landmarks and physical and human features, and translating these observations into a simple hand-drawn map with a basic symbol key.
- **Simple fieldwork and observational skills** — Going out into the school grounds and immediate surrounding environment to observe, describe and record human and physical geographical features at first hand, practising the habits of direct geographical enquiry.
- **Using maps, atlases, globes and digital mapping** — Extending atlas and map use to locate countries and describe the features studied across the curriculum, and beginning to use digital and computer mapping tools — including online satellite maps — to access geographical information in a range of formats.
- **Eight-point compass and Ordnance Survey map skills** — Applying the eight compass points, four-figure and six-figure grid references, and the symbols and conventions of Ordnance Survey maps to build knowledge of the UK and the wider world, and to navigate and locate features on topographic maps.
