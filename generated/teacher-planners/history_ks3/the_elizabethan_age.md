## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Power, Monarchy and Democracy (HI-KS3-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The history of political power in Britain is the story of the transformation from absolute monarchy to parliamentary democracy over approximately a thousand years. Key stages include the limitation of royal power by Magna Carta (1215), the development of Parliament, the English Civil War and execution of Charles I, the Glorious Revolution and constitutional monarchy, the gradual extension of the franchise, and the welfare state. Understanding this progression requires analysis of the forces that drove change - economic development, religious conflict, intellectual movements, social pressure - and the contested nature of each advance.

**Teaching guidance:** Build an explicit narrative of the development of British democracy as a thread running through medieval and early modern history. Study key moments of constitutional change in depth: Magna Carta, the Civil War, the Glorious Revolution, the Reform Acts, universal suffrage. Analyse the arguments of those who resisted and those who demanded change. Connect to pupils' understanding of current democratic institutions: Parliament, elections, rights. Compare British constitutional development with developments in other countries.

**Key vocabulary:** monarchy, parliament, democracy, constitution, rights, revolution, reform, franchise, suffrage, civil war, constitutional, feudal, Magna Carta, sovereignty, power

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may see the development of democracy as inevitable or straightforward. The contested, reversible nature of each advance - and the real possibility that different outcomes were possible - develops more sophisticated historical understanding. Pupils may present Magna Carta as establishing democracy; in reality it was a document protecting baronial privilege, and its later association with rights is a product of subsequent reinterpretation. The diversity of attitudes to democracy across different social groups at each stage of change needs explicit attention.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify some key events in British political history (e.g. Magna Carta, the Civil War) and recognise that Britain is a democracy, but struggles to explain how political power changed over time. | Name two events that were important in the development of democracy in Britain. | Listing events without explaining their connection to the development of democracy; Assuming Magna Carta created democracy rather than being one step in a long process |
| **Developing** | Can describe several stages in the development of British democracy and explain basic cause-and-effect relationships between events, with some understanding that change was contested and gradual. | Explain how the English Civil War changed the balance of power between Parliament and the monarchy. | Describing the Civil War as a simple fight between two sides without explaining the underlying political dispute; Not connecting the Civil War to the longer story of constitutional development |
| **Secure** | Can construct a clear narrative of constitutional change across the medieval and early modern periods, explaining multiple causes of change and analysing how different social groups experienced and drove political transformation. | How far was the development of democracy in Britain a story of steady progress? Use examples from at least three different periods to support your argument. | Presenting constitutional development as an inevitable march towards democracy without acknowledging resistance and reversals; Focusing only on political events without considering the economic and social forces driving change |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate competing historical interpretations of British constitutional development, assess the relative significance of different factors driving change, and make connections between British and comparative international developments. | Some historians argue that the development of British democracy was driven primarily by pressure from below (popular movements), while others argue it was shaped by decisions from above (elite concessions). Which interpretation do you find more convincing, and why? | Accepting one interpretation uncritically without evaluating the evidence for and against it; Not using specific historical evidence to support the evaluation of competing interpretations |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Magna Carta in 1215 limited the power of the king. The English Civil War in the 1640s led to Parliament becoming more powerful than the monarch.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Before the Civil War, Charles I believed in the divine right of kings and tried to rule without Parliament. Parliament fought against him because they wanted a say in how the country was governed, especially over taxation. After Parliament won the war, Charles I was executed in 1649, showing that even a king could be held accountable. Although the monarchy was restored in 1660, Parliament kept more power than before. The Glorious Revolution of 1688 then confirmed that Parliament, not the monarch, was the supreme authority.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *The development of British democracy was not a story of steady progress but of contested, uneven change with significant setbacks. Magna Carta (1215) limited royal power, but it protected baronial privilege, not ordinary people's rights. The Peasants' Revolt (1381) showed that common people demanded a voice, but it was violently suppressed. The Civil War and Glorious Revolution (1640s-1688) established parliamentary sovereignty, but Parliament represented only wealthy men. The Reform Acts of the 19th century gradually extended the franchise, but universal suffrage was not achieved until 1928. At each stage, those in power resisted change and those demanding it faced real risk. Progress was driven by economic change, religious conflict, intellectual movements like the Enlightenment, and sustained pressure from excluded groups. The outcome was never inevitable.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Both interpretations capture part of the truth, but neither is sufficient alone. The 'pressure from below' interpretation correctly identifies moments when popular action forced change: the Peasants' Revolt challenged feudal assumptions, Chartism created mass political consciousness, and the suffragette movement made women's exclusion untenable. However, the 'concessions from above' interpretation explains why change took the specific forms it did: the Great Reform Act of 1832 was carefully designed by elites to extend just enough franchise to defuse revolutionary pressure while preserving their own dominance. The most convincing interpretation is that democratic development resulted from the interaction between popular pressure and elite calculation. Elites conceded reform when the cost of resistance exceeded the cost of concession, but the timing, form and extent of reform were shaped by the strength and organisation of popular movements. Comparing with France, where elite resistance to reform led to violent revolution, suggests that the British pattern of incremental concession was contingent on the specific balance of political forces rather than being an inherent national characteristic.*

### Secondary concept: Empire, Colonialism and its Consequences (HI-KS3-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The British Empire was at its height one of the largest empires in history, eventually covering approximately a quarter of the world's land surface. Its creation involved trade, conquest, settlement and the exploitation of colonised peoples and their resources. The transatlantic slave trade was an integral part of the economic system of empire. Decolonisation in the twentieth century dismantled formal imperial structures, but the legacies of empire - in patterns of global inequality, migration, cultural exchange and political boundaries - remain central to understanding the contemporary world. At KS3, pupils develop analytical understanding of empire as a global historical force with enduring consequences.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify that Britain had an empire and that the slave trade was part of it, but has limited factual knowledge of the chronology, geography and mechanisms of empire. | Describing the empire in very general terms without specific examples or dates; Not recognising that the slave trade involved the forced transportation of millions of people over centuries |
| **Developing** | Can describe the main phases of the British Empire chronologically and explain the role of the slave trade as an economic system, with some understanding of both colonial and colonised perspectives. | Describing the slave trade without explaining its economic function within the wider empire; Not mentioning the human suffering and mortality of the Middle Passage |
| **Secure** | Can analyse the causes and consequences of British imperialism across multiple periods, explain the experiences of colonised peoples alongside those of colonisers, and evaluate the process of decolonisation. | Attributing decolonisation entirely to British generosity rather than recognising the agency of independence movements; Not explaining the lasting legacies of empire in shaping post-colonial societies |
| **Mastery** | Can critically evaluate different historical interpretations of the British Empire, assess its long-term significance using explicit criteria, and connect imperial history to contemporary global issues with analytical sophistication. | Adopting an uncritically positive or negative framing without engaging with the complexity of different experiences and perspectives; Making sweeping judgements about 'the empire' without recognising that imperial experience varied enormously by place, period and social group |

### Secondary concept: Constructing Historical Arguments (HI-KS3-C004)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

A historical argument is a structured, evidenced response to a historical question, in which a thesis is developed, supported by selected and evaluated evidence, and qualified where necessary by consideration of counter-evidence or alternative interpretations. Constructing historical arguments requires integrating all the second-order concepts of the discipline: chronological knowledge, causal understanding, appreciation of significance, ability to evaluate evidence and awareness of interpretive diversity. At KS3, pupils are expected to construct extended historical arguments in both oral discussion and extended writing.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can write about historical events in a descriptive, narrative way but struggles to organise information around an argument or answer a specific historical question analytically. | Describing what happened rather than explaining why it was significant; Not developing points beyond a single sentence |
| **Developing** | Can structure a response around a historical question, making a clear point supported by evidence, though arguments may be one-sided and evidence may not be fully explained. | Only explaining one cause without considering alternative factors; Asserting that something was important without explaining the mechanism by which it led to the outcome |
| **Secure** | Can construct a sustained historical argument with a clear thesis, deploying selected evidence to support the argument and addressing counter-evidence or alternative interpretations. | Making a one-sided argument without acknowledging counter-evidence; Including evidence that is not explicitly linked to the argument being made |
| **Mastery** | Can construct a sophisticated, multi-layered historical argument that integrates multiple second-order concepts, evaluates competing interpretations, and demonstrates awareness of the limits of historical knowledge. | Agreeing or disagreeing with the claim without establishing and applying criteria for assessing significance; Treating the different types of consequence as separate rather than analysing how they interconnected |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Each constitutional turning point (the English Civil War, the Glorious Revolution, the Great Reform Act) requires pupils to explain what caused power to shift, which actors drove change, and what the long-run consequences were for the distribution of political authority.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- Does this show a cause, or just a correlation?
- What is the mechanism — how exactly does A lead to B?
- Which factor had the biggest effect, and how could you tell?
- What evidence would you need to prove this was the cause?

**Secondary lens:** Continuity and Change Over Time — The eight-century arc from Norman kingship to modern democracy is an extended continuity_change analysis — pupils must identify the moments of genuine constitutional rupture (Magna Carta, Civil War, Reform Acts) and distinguish them from periods of apparent stability where underlying power relations were shifting incrementally.

## Session structure: Topic Study + Source Enquiry

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Topic Study (main structure)
A structured enquiry into a defined topic, period, or place. Begins with an engaging hook to capture interest, builds contextual knowledge, moves through source analysis and interpretation, and culminates in a substantiated argument or conclusion. The core humanities template.

`hook` → `context` → `source_analysis` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Extended writing task presenting a reasoned argument supported by evidence from the topic. Can take the form of an essay, structured explanation, or debate position.

**Teacher note:** Use the TOPIC STUDY template: frame the session around a substantive historical, geographical, or ethical question. Contextualise using relevant background and terminology. Provide a range of sources for structured analysis, prompting pupils to evaluate reliability and typicality. Expect pupils to construct an evidence-based argument that addresses the enquiry question.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How reliable is this source for answering our enquiry question?
- What contextual factors might explain this interpretation?
- How would you weigh the evidence from these different sources?
- What argument would you construct, and what counter-argument must you address?

### Source Enquiry
A disciplinary history enquiry centred on working with primary and secondary sources. Pupils select relevant sources, contextualise them within their historical period, interrogate them for reliability, utility, and bias, cross-reference between sources, interpret what they reveal, and construct an argument based on the evidence.

`source_selection` → `contextualisation` → `interrogation` → `cross_referencing` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Source-based extended writing that demonstrates ability to analyse provenance, cross-reference sources, reach substantiated interpretations, and construct a historical argument.

**Teacher note:** Use the SOURCE ENQUIRY template: provide a range of primary and secondary sources relevant to a focused enquiry question. Guide pupils through contextualisation, interrogation of content and provenance, and systematic cross-referencing. Expect pupils to evaluate the utility and reliability of each source for the specific enquiry, and to construct an evidence-based interpretation.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How useful is this source for our specific enquiry question?
- What does the provenance of this source tell us about its reliability?
- Where do these sources corroborate or contradict each other?
- What interpretation does the balance of evidence support?

## Primary sources

1 historically grounded source types are available for this study:

### 1. The Armada Portrait of Elizabeth I (KS3 analysis) (Primary Visual, )
See HSRC-005 for full provenance. At KS3, the portrait is analysed in greater depth as a piece of political propaganda: the symbolism of the globe, the pearl ropes, the English fleet and the wrecked Armada are all decoded as deliberate statements of power, legitimacy and divine favour.

**How to use:** At KS3: systematic propaganda analysis. Identify every symbol in the painting and decode its meaning. Ask: 'Who was this portrait painted for?' and 'What message is Elizabeth sending to her subjects and to foreign powers?' Then: 'This is one person's version of Elizabeth. How would a Catholic recusant, or a Spanish diplomat, have depicted her differently?' This develops the concept that all historical representations are constructions.

## Disciplinary concepts foregrounded

| Concept | Key question | Role in this study |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Evidence and Interpretation | How do we know about this, and how do historians disagree? | At KS3, analyse the Armada Portrait as propaganda. Who created it, why, and what message does it convey? How does this challenge the 'Golden Age' narrative? |
| Cause and Consequence | Why did this happen, and what were the effects? | At KS3, analyse the multiple causes of the Spanish Armada and the consequences of its defeat for England's international position. |
| Significance | Why does this matter, and to whom? | At KS3, construct an argued evaluation: was Elizabeth's reign a genuine 'Golden Age' or has its significance been constructed? |
| Change and Continuity | What changed, what stayed the same, and why? | At KS3, assess what changed in England during Elizabeth's reign (religion, international status, colonial ambitions) and what continuities persisted. |

## Key figures and events

**Key figures:** Elizabeth I, Francis Drake, Mary Queen of Scots, William Shakespeare, Walter Raleigh

**Key events:**
- Elizabethan Religious Settlement 1559
- Execution of Mary Queen of Scots 1587
- Defeat of Spanish Armada 1588
- Founding of Roanoke colony 1585

**Period:** 1558 - 1603

**Perspectives to include:** Elizabeth I, Catholic recusant, explorer, Spanish opponent, colonised peoples

**Significance claim:** The Elizabethan Age established England as a Protestant nation, a maritime power and a nascent colonial state, setting the trajectory that would lead to the British Empire.

**Historiographical debate:**
- The 'Golden Age' framing of Elizabeth's reign has been challenged by historians who emphasise poverty, religious oppression and failed colonial ventures
- Whether Elizabeth's religious settlement was a genuine compromise or a Protestant victory dressed as moderation remains debated

---

## Why this study matters

The Elizabethan Age is a crucial transition point encompassing the Reformation, the beginnings of global exploration and the emergence of English national identity. Elizabeth I's management of the religious settlement is an outstanding case study of political compromise.

---

## Sequencing

**Leads to:** Early Elizabethan England 1558-1588

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Accepting the 'Golden Age' label uncritically rather than examining it as historical interpretation and propaganda
2. Treating Elizabeth as a singular genius rather than examining the political context
3. Discussing exploration without acknowledging its impact on indigenous peoples

## Sensitive content

- Exploration and early colonisation involved violence against indigenous peoples; present from multiple perspectives
- Religious persecution (of Catholics and Puritans alike) should be discussed with sensitivity
- The execution of Mary Queen of Scots raises questions about justice, politics and power

---

## Historical thinking skills (KS3)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Chronological understanding** — Understand and use chronological frameworks to sequence events, periods and changes over time; develop a chronologically secure knowledge of British, local and world history using historical time vocabulary with increasing precision; construct and interpret timelines that place events in meaningful relation to each other.
- **Causation and consequence** — Understand why historical events and changes happened by identifying and explaining multiple causes; assess the intended and unintended consequences of events and decisions; distinguish between long-term structural factors and immediate triggers; construct causal arguments using historical evidence.
- **Change and continuity** — Identify what changed and what remained constant across historical periods; assess the pace, nature and extent of change; distinguish between long-term trends and short-term fluctuations; understand that change can be experienced differently by different groups within the same society.
- **Similarity and difference** — Identify and explain similarities and differences within and across historical periods, societies and cultures; avoid anachronism by understanding people's lives and choices within their own contexts; make valid comparisons that illuminate both the distinctiveness of periods and the common threads of human experience.
- **Historical significance** — Assess the significance of historical events, people and developments using explicit criteria such as scale of impact, duration, number of people affected, degree of change caused, and how an event is remembered and commemorated; understand that significance is not fixed but is constructed and contested by historians and societies over time.
- **Historical evidence** — Locate, select and use a range of primary and secondary historical sources; understand provenance and evaluate a source's utility and reliability in relation to a specific enquiry; corroborate claims across multiple sources; recognise that all sources are partial and that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
