## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Constructing Historical Arguments (HI-KS3-C004)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

A historical argument is a structured, evidenced response to a historical question, in which a thesis is developed, supported by selected and evaluated evidence, and qualified where necessary by consideration of counter-evidence or alternative interpretations. Constructing historical arguments requires integrating all the second-order concepts of the discipline: chronological knowledge, causal understanding, appreciation of significance, ability to evaluate evidence and awareness of interpretive diversity. At KS3, pupils are expected to construct extended historical arguments in both oral discussion and extended writing.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach argument construction explicitly as a skill: develop a thesis, select supporting evidence, address counter-evidence, conclude. Use structured debate and discussion activities to develop oral argument skills before extended writing. Teach pupils to signal the structure of their argument through discourse markers (However, Furthermore, Nevertheless). Build essay writing skills progressively: from paragraph structure to full essay. Use mark schemes and exemplars to make clear what a strong historical argument looks like. Provide regular feedback focused on argument quality as well as historical knowledge.

**Key vocabulary:** argument, thesis, evidence, counter-argument, evaluate, interpret, justify, assert, claim, support, qualify, conclude, sustained, analytical, perspective

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may write descriptive narratives rather than analytical arguments, telling a story rather than answering a question. Making the question central and repeatedly asking 'does this sentence answer the question?' redirects from narrative to argument. Pupils may present evidence without linking it explicitly to their argument; teaching them to explain the significance of each piece of evidence develops more analytical writing. The idea that a good historical argument acknowledges and addresses counter-evidence rather than ignoring it is important to establish.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can write about historical events in a descriptive, narrative way but struggles to organise information around an argument or answer a specific historical question analytically. | Why was the Battle of Hastings a turning point in English history? | Describing what happened rather than explaining why it was significant; Not developing points beyond a single sentence |
| **Developing** | Can structure a response around a historical question, making a clear point supported by evidence, though arguments may be one-sided and evidence may not be fully explained. | Was the Black Death the most important cause of the Peasants' Revolt of 1381? Explain your answer. | Only explaining one cause without considering alternative factors; Asserting that something was important without explaining the mechanism by which it led to the outcome |
| **Secure** | Can construct a sustained historical argument with a clear thesis, deploying selected evidence to support the argument and addressing counter-evidence or alternative interpretations. | How far do you agree that the Industrial Revolution improved life for ordinary people in Britain? Use evidence to support your argument. | Making a one-sided argument without acknowledging counter-evidence; Including evidence that is not explicitly linked to the argument being made |
| **Mastery** | Can construct a sophisticated, multi-layered historical argument that integrates multiple second-order concepts, evaluates competing interpretations, and demonstrates awareness of the limits of historical knowledge. | Construct an argument in response to the following claim: 'The most significant consequence of the First World War was the political transformation of Europe.' Do you agree? | Agreeing or disagreeing with the claim without establishing and applying criteria for assessing significance; Treating the different types of consequence as separate rather than analysing how they interconnected |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *The Battle of Hastings happened in 1066 when William of Normandy fought King Harold. William won the battle and became King of England. After this, lots of things changed in England.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *The Black Death was an important cause of the Peasants' Revolt because it killed about a third of the population. This meant there were fewer workers, so peasants could demand higher wages. However, the lords and the government tried to keep wages low by passing the Statute of Labourers in 1351, which made peasants angry. The Poll Tax of 1381 was the trigger that actually started the revolt because it demanded the same amount of money from rich and poor alike, which was unfair. So the Black Death was an important underlying cause, but the revolt was also caused by the government's attempts to control wages and the unfair tax.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *The Industrial Revolution brought both significant improvements and significant deterioration to the lives of ordinary people, and the balance varied by period, region and social group. In the short term (1780-1840), conditions for many factory and mine workers were harsh: long hours, dangerous conditions, child labour, and overcrowded urban housing with poor sanitation led to high mortality and widespread suffering. Evidence from reports like the Sadler Committee (1832) documented appalling conditions in textile mills. However, in the longer term, industrialisation generated rising real wages (from approximately 1840 onwards), cheaper manufactured goods, and expanding opportunities for employment and social mobility. The development of railways connected communities and reduced the price of food and goods. The key qualification is that improvement was uneven: factory owners and the emerging middle class benefited earlier and more substantially than manual labourers. Women's working conditions in mills were often worse than men's, and children were exploited until factory legislation provided protection. Therefore, while the Industrial Revolution ultimately raised living standards for most of the population, it did so at the cost of immense short-term suffering, and the benefits were distributed unequally. The argument that it 'improved life' depends on the timeframe and the social group being considered.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *The political transformation of Europe was certainly one of the most significant consequences of the First World War, but whether it was the most significant depends on what criteria of significance we apply and what timeframe we consider. Politically, the war destroyed four empires (Russian, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, German), created new nation-states across central and eastern Europe, and established the conditions for both the Russian Revolution (1917) and the rise of fascism in the 1920s-30s. These political consequences were enormous in scale and enduring in their effects. However, the social consequences were equally transformative: the experience of total war permanently altered the relationship between citizens and the state, expanded women's roles in public life, and created a generation profoundly shaped by the trauma of industrial warfare. The cultural consequences — the destruction of 19th-century optimism, the rise of modernism, the literature of disillusionment — transformed European intellectual and artistic life. Economically, the war created the debt structures and reparation demands that destabilised the 1920s and contributed to the Great Depression. If we define significance by long-term impact, the war's most significant consequence may be that it made the Second World War possible: the political settlements of 1919, particularly the Treaty of Versailles, created grievances and instabilities that directly contributed to the rise of Nazism and the outbreak of war in 1939. An argument for political transformation as the most significant consequence must therefore show that it was the political changes that generated the most far-reaching and enduring effects — which is plausible but not conclusive, since the social, economic and cultural consequences were equally profound and interconnected with the political ones.*

### Secondary concept: Power, Monarchy and Democracy (HI-KS3-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The history of political power in Britain is the story of the transformation from absolute monarchy to parliamentary democracy over approximately a thousand years. Key stages include the limitation of royal power by Magna Carta (1215), the development of Parliament, the English Civil War and execution of Charles I, the Glorious Revolution and constitutional monarchy, the gradual extension of the franchise, and the welfare state. Understanding this progression requires analysis of the forces that drove change - economic development, religious conflict, intellectual movements, social pressure - and the contested nature of each advance.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify some key events in British political history (e.g. Magna Carta, the Civil War) and recognise that Britain is a democracy, but struggles to explain how political power changed over time. | Listing events without explaining their connection to the development of democracy; Assuming Magna Carta created democracy rather than being one step in a long process |
| **Developing** | Can describe several stages in the development of British democracy and explain basic cause-and-effect relationships between events, with some understanding that change was contested and gradual. | Describing the Civil War as a simple fight between two sides without explaining the underlying political dispute; Not connecting the Civil War to the longer story of constitutional development |
| **Secure** | Can construct a clear narrative of constitutional change across the medieval and early modern periods, explaining multiple causes of change and analysing how different social groups experienced and drove political transformation. | Presenting constitutional development as an inevitable march towards democracy without acknowledging resistance and reversals; Focusing only on political events without considering the economic and social forces driving change |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate competing historical interpretations of British constitutional development, assess the relative significance of different factors driving change, and make connections between British and comparative international developments. | Accepting one interpretation uncritically without evaluating the evidence for and against it; Not using specific historical evidence to support the evaluation of competing interpretations |

### Secondary concept: Empire, Colonialism and its Consequences (HI-KS3-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The British Empire was at its height one of the largest empires in history, eventually covering approximately a quarter of the world's land surface. Its creation involved trade, conquest, settlement and the exploitation of colonised peoples and their resources. The transatlantic slave trade was an integral part of the economic system of empire. Decolonisation in the twentieth century dismantled formal imperial structures, but the legacies of empire - in patterns of global inequality, migration, cultural exchange and political boundaries - remain central to understanding the contemporary world. At KS3, pupils develop analytical understanding of empire as a global historical force with enduring consequences.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify that Britain had an empire and that the slave trade was part of it, but has limited factual knowledge of the chronology, geography and mechanisms of empire. | Describing the empire in very general terms without specific examples or dates; Not recognising that the slave trade involved the forced transportation of millions of people over centuries |
| **Developing** | Can describe the main phases of the British Empire chronologically and explain the role of the slave trade as an economic system, with some understanding of both colonial and colonised perspectives. | Describing the slave trade without explaining its economic function within the wider empire; Not mentioning the human suffering and mortality of the Middle Passage |
| **Secure** | Can analyse the causes and consequences of British imperialism across multiple periods, explain the experiences of colonised peoples alongside those of colonisers, and evaluate the process of decolonisation. | Attributing decolonisation entirely to British generosity rather than recognising the agency of independence movements; Not explaining the lasting legacies of empire in shaping post-colonial societies |
| **Mastery** | Can critically evaluate different historical interpretations of the British Empire, assess its long-term significance using explicit criteria, and connect imperial history to contemporary global issues with analytical sophistication. | Adopting an uncritically positive or negative framing without engaging with the complexity of different experiences and perspectives; Making sweeping judgements about 'the empire' without recognising that imperial experience varied enormously by place, period and social group |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** The Holocaust requires pupils to trace a causal sequence from the conditions that enabled Nazi ideology to take hold, through the escalating persecution, to systematic genocide — and to evaluate the role of individual choices, institutional failures and international inaction in enabling each step.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- Does this show a cause, or just a correlation?
- What is the mechanism — how exactly does A lead to B?
- Which factor had the biggest effect, and how could you tell?
- What evidence would you need to prove this was the cause?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Constructing extended written responses that use second-order concepts to answer historical questions with a structured, evidenced thesis is the most direct application of evidence_argument reasoning in the curriculum — pupils must move from source handling to analytical claim-making in a sustained piece of writing.

---

## Session structure: Topic Study + Comparison Study

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Topic Study (main structure)
A structured enquiry into a defined topic, period, or place. Begins with an engaging hook to capture interest, builds contextual knowledge, moves through source analysis and interpretation, and culminates in a substantiated argument or conclusion. The core humanities template.

`hook` → `context` → `source_analysis` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Extended writing task presenting a reasoned argument supported by evidence from the topic. Can take the form of an essay, structured explanation, or debate position.

**Teacher note:** Use the TOPIC STUDY template: frame the session around a substantive historical, geographical, or ethical question. Contextualise using relevant background and terminology. Provide a range of sources for structured analysis, prompting pupils to evaluate reliability and typicality. Expect pupils to construct an evidence-based argument that addresses the enquiry question.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How reliable is this source for answering our enquiry question?
- What contextual factors might explain this interpretation?
- How would you weigh the evidence from these different sources?
- What argument would you construct, and what counter-argument must you address?

### Comparison Study
A structured comparison of two or more examples, places, periods, or perspectives. Introduces each example with sufficient context, applies a systematic comparison framework, analyses similarities and differences with supporting evidence, and reaches an evaluative conclusion about the significance of those differences.

`introduce_examples` → `systematic_comparison` → `analysis` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Comparative analysis using a structured framework (table, Venn diagram, or essay), demonstrating understanding of both examples and reaching a substantiated evaluative conclusion.

**Teacher note:** Use the COMPARISON STUDY template: introduce the examples with relevant contextual detail and guide pupils to develop their own criteria for comparison. Expect systematic analysis using appropriate frameworks, with attention to both similarities and differences. Prompt pupils to evaluate the significance of the comparison and consider what it reveals about broader patterns or processes.

**KS3 question stems:**
- What criteria will you use for comparison, and why are they appropriate?
- What does this comparison reveal about broader patterns or processes?
- Are the differences more significant than the similarities, or vice versa?
- How might the context explain both the similarities and the differences?

## Disciplinary concepts foregrounded

| Concept | Key question | Role in this study |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Cause and Consequence | Why did this happen, and what were the effects? | At KS3, analyse the complex, interacting causes of the Spanish conquest (technology, disease, alliance-building, internal divisions). |
| Similarity and Difference | How was this similar to or different from other times, places, or peoples? | At KS3, compare Aztec/Inca empires with contemporary European states using systematic criteria. |
| Evidence and Interpretation | How do we know about this, and how do historians disagree? | At KS3, critically evaluate Spanish conquest accounts: what biases and purposes shaped them? |
| Significance | Why does this matter, and to whom? | At KS3, evaluate the significance of the conquest of the Americas for world history. |

## Key figures and events

**Key figures:** Montezuma II, Atahualpa, Hernan Cortes, Francisco Pizarro

**Key events:**
- Founding of Tenochtitlan c.1325
- Rise of Inca Empire c.1438
- Spanish conquest of Aztec Empire 1519-21
- Spanish conquest of Inca Empire 1532-72

**Period:** c.1200 - 1572

**Perspectives to include:** Aztec ruler, Inca ruler, Spanish conquistador, indigenous subject peoples, modern indigenous descendant

**Significance claim:** The pre-Columbian Americas demonstrate that complex empires, engineering achievements and cultural systems developed independently of the Old World, and their conquest represents one of history's most consequential cross-cultural encounters.

**Historiographical debate:**
- Whether the Spanish conquest was primarily driven by military technology, disease, internal divisions among indigenous peoples, or a combination is debated
- The reliability and perspective of Spanish conquest accounts has been extensively challenged by historians working with indigenous sources

---

## Why this study matters

The Aztec and Inca empires offer compelling case studies of complex civilisations that developed entirely independently of the Old World. The Spanish conquest provides one of the most dramatic examples of cross-cultural encounter in history and raises profound questions about power, technology and colonialism.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Presenting the civilisations as primitive or inevitably doomed to conquest
2. Sensationalising Aztec human sacrifice without contextualising it within their cosmological framework
3. Telling the story of the Spanish conquest solely from the European perspective

## Sensitive content

- Human sacrifice in Aztec religion requires careful, contextualised teaching
- The Spanish conquest involved genocide and cultural destruction; present honestly
- Recognise that indigenous peoples of the Americas are living communities with ongoing histories

## Historical thinking skills (KS3)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Chronological understanding** — Understand and use chronological frameworks to sequence events, periods and changes over time; develop a chronologically secure knowledge of British, local and world history using historical time vocabulary with increasing precision; construct and interpret timelines that place events in meaningful relation to each other.
- **Causation and consequence** — Understand why historical events and changes happened by identifying and explaining multiple causes; assess the intended and unintended consequences of events and decisions; distinguish between long-term structural factors and immediate triggers; construct causal arguments using historical evidence.
- **Change and continuity** — Identify what changed and what remained constant across historical periods; assess the pace, nature and extent of change; distinguish between long-term trends and short-term fluctuations; understand that change can be experienced differently by different groups within the same society.
- **Similarity and difference** — Identify and explain similarities and differences within and across historical periods, societies and cultures; avoid anachronism by understanding people's lives and choices within their own contexts; make valid comparisons that illuminate both the distinctiveness of periods and the common threads of human experience.
- **Historical significance** — Assess the significance of historical events, people and developments using explicit criteria such as scale of impact, duration, number of people affected, degree of change caused, and how an event is remembered and commemorated; understand that significance is not fixed but is constructed and contested by historians and societies over time.
- **Historical evidence** — Locate, select and use a range of primary and secondary historical sources; understand provenance and evaluate a source's utility and reliability in relation to a specific enquiry; corroborate claims across multiple sources; recognise that all sources are partial and that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
