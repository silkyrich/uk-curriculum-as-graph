## Enquiry questions

1. How did persecution escalate from discrimination to genocide, and could it have been stopped?
2. What can testimony tell us that other historical sources cannot?
3. Why does the Holocaust matter today, and what is our responsibility to remember?

---

## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: The Holocaust: Understanding Genocide (HI-KS3-C003)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The Holocaust was the systematic, state-sponsored persecution and murder of six million Jews by the Nazi regime and its collaborators between 1933 and 1945. It also included the murder of millions of others: Roma, disabled people, Soviet prisoners of war, political opponents, gay men. Understanding the Holocaust requires knowledge of the specific historical context (Weimar Germany, the rise of Nazism, antisemitism), the mechanisms of persecution (propaganda, legal discrimination, ghettoisation, deportation, mass murder), and the responses of bystanders, collaborators, resisters and rescuers. It also requires engagement with the moral questions the Holocaust raises about human nature, responsibility and the fragility of civilisation.

**Teaching guidance:** Follow guidance from the Holocaust Educational Trust and Yad Vashem on sensitive and effective Holocaust education. Begin with individual testimony to establish the human reality before moving to broader historical context. Study the progression of persecution rather than jumping to the death camps. Examine the roles of different groups: perpetrators, bystanders, collaborators, resisters, rescuers. Discuss the conditions that made the Holocaust possible: the role of ideology, propaganda, dehumanisation, bureaucracy and ordinary people's choices. Avoid comparisons that trivialise the Holocaust. Connect to the concept of genocide and international human rights frameworks that emerged in response.

**Key vocabulary:** Holocaust, genocide, antisemitism, Nazi, persecution, deportation, concentration camp, extermination, testimony, survivor, bystander, perpetrator, rescuer, never again, memorial

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may think the Holocaust happened quickly and suddenly. Understanding the gradual escalation of persecution from 1933 to 1945 - and that it was not inevitable at any stage - develops more nuanced understanding. Pupils may portray all Germans as knowing perpetrators or all as ignorant victims; the complex spectrum of responses - active support, passive compliance, resistance and rescue - challenges simple categorisation. The Holocaust should be understood in its specific historical context rather than as a timeless example of human evil.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify the Holocaust as an event in which millions of Jewish people were killed by the Nazis during the Second World War, but has limited understanding of how persecution escalated or why it happened. | What was the Holocaust? Who was targeted and what happened to them? | Stating the facts of mass murder without any understanding of how persecution escalated over time; Not recognising that the Holocaust targeted multiple groups alongside the Jewish people |
| **Developing** | Can describe the escalation of persecution from legal discrimination to mass murder, identify key stages in the process, and explain the role of Nazi ideology in motivating the Holocaust. | Explain how the persecution of Jewish people in Germany escalated between 1933 and 1945. | Jumping straight to the death camps without explaining the years of escalating persecution that preceded them; Treating the Holocaust as inevitable rather than as the result of specific decisions and choices |
| **Secure** | Can analyse the roles of different groups in the Holocaust (perpetrators, bystanders, collaborators, resisters, rescuers), explain the conditions that made genocide possible, and engage thoughtfully with the moral complexity of the period. | Why did so many ordinary people participate in, or fail to prevent, the Holocaust? Consider the roles of perpetrators, bystanders and resisters. | Portraying all Germans as either knowing perpetrators or completely ignorant, ignoring the complex spectrum of responses; Not acknowledging the existence of resistance and rescue alongside complicity and collaboration |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate different historical interpretations of the Holocaust, connect it to broader questions about genocide and human rights, and critically assess its significance for the contemporary world using explicit criteria. | Historians debate whether the Holocaust was a uniquely evil event or whether it should be understood as one example of a broader pattern of genocide in modern history. What is at stake in this debate, and what is your assessment? | Treating the debate as merely academic without recognising the moral and political stakes involved; Making comparisons that trivialise the Holocaust or that dismiss the experiences of victims of other genocides |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *The Holocaust was when the Nazi government in Germany murdered six million Jewish people during the Second World War. Jewish people were taken from their homes, sent to concentration camps, and killed. Other groups were also targeted including Roma people, disabled people and gay men.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Persecution escalated gradually over twelve years. After the Nazis came to power in 1933, they passed laws removing Jewish people's rights, including the Nuremberg Laws (1935) which stripped Jewish Germans of citizenship. Kristallnacht (1938) saw organised violence against Jewish businesses and synagogues. During the war, Jewish people in occupied territories were forced into ghettos where many died from starvation and disease. From 1941, the Nazis began systematic mass murder through mobile killing units (Einsatzgruppen) and then through extermination camps like Auschwitz-Birkenau. The escalation was driven by Nazi antisemitic ideology, which portrayed Jewish people as racially inferior and as enemies of the German state. At each stage, the persecution intensified, but it was not inevitable that discrimination would lead to genocide.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *The Holocaust required the participation or acquiescence of millions of ordinary people, not just a small number of fanatical Nazis. Perpetrators included bureaucrats who organised deportations, soldiers who carried out shootings, and camp guards who ran the extermination process. Many were motivated by ideological conviction, but others participated through obedience to authority, career ambition, or gradual desensitisation. Bystanders across occupied Europe witnessed persecution but often did not intervene, whether from fear of personal consequences, indifference, or the belief that they could not make a difference. Some actively collaborated, handing over Jewish neighbours or profiting from seized property. However, there were also resisters and rescuers who risked their lives to help Jewish people: individuals like Oskar Schindler, communities like Le Chambon-sur-Lignon in France, and organised networks across Europe. The conditions that made the Holocaust possible included: a powerful state apparatus willing to use it for genocide; propaganda that dehumanised Jewish people over many years; a culture of obedience to authority; the disruption and moral confusion of wartime; and the fragmentation of responsibility so that each individual's contribution seemed small.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *This debate has both historical and moral dimensions. The 'uniqueness' position (associated with Elie Wiesel and others) argues that the Holocaust was unprecedented in its industrial-scale bureaucratic killing, its targeting of an entire people for total annihilation regardless of any military objective, and its occurrence in the heart of European civilisation. This interpretation emphasises that the Holocaust should not be relativised by comparison. The 'comparative' position (associated with scholars of genocide like Raphael Lemkin) argues that understanding the Holocaust alongside other genocides (the Armenian genocide, Rwanda, Cambodia) reveals patterns in how genocides develop and can be prevented. This interpretation emphasises practical lessons for prevention. Both positions have merit. The Holocaust was distinctive in its scale, method and ideological character, and treating it as merely one example among many risks losing its specific historical meaning. However, treating it as absolutely unique risks suggesting that it can never happen again and has no lessons for understanding other genocides. The most productive approach may be to study the Holocaust in its specific historical context while also recognising the patterns it shares with other genocides: the role of dehumanising ideology, the escalation from discrimination to violence, the failure of bystanders to intervene, and the conditions under which ordinary people participate in extraordinary evil. The concept of genocide itself, and the international legal frameworks designed to prevent it (the Genocide Convention, the International Criminal Court), emerged directly from the experience of the Holocaust, making its legacy central to contemporary human rights.*

### Secondary concept: Empire, Colonialism and its Consequences (HI-KS3-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The British Empire was at its height one of the largest empires in history, eventually covering approximately a quarter of the world's land surface. Its creation involved trade, conquest, settlement and the exploitation of colonised peoples and their resources. The transatlantic slave trade was an integral part of the economic system of empire. Decolonisation in the twentieth century dismantled formal imperial structures, but the legacies of empire - in patterns of global inequality, migration, cultural exchange and political boundaries - remain central to understanding the contemporary world. At KS3, pupils develop analytical understanding of empire as a global historical force with enduring consequences.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify that Britain had an empire and that the slave trade was part of it, but has limited factual knowledge of the chronology, geography and mechanisms of empire. | Describing the empire in very general terms without specific examples or dates; Not recognising that the slave trade involved the forced transportation of millions of people over centuries |
| **Developing** | Can describe the main phases of the British Empire chronologically and explain the role of the slave trade as an economic system, with some understanding of both colonial and colonised perspectives. | Describing the slave trade without explaining its economic function within the wider empire; Not mentioning the human suffering and mortality of the Middle Passage |
| **Secure** | Can analyse the causes and consequences of British imperialism across multiple periods, explain the experiences of colonised peoples alongside those of colonisers, and evaluate the process of decolonisation. | Attributing decolonisation entirely to British generosity rather than recognising the agency of independence movements; Not explaining the lasting legacies of empire in shaping post-colonial societies |
| **Mastery** | Can critically evaluate different historical interpretations of the British Empire, assess its long-term significance using explicit criteria, and connect imperial history to contemporary global issues with analytical sophistication. | Adopting an uncritically positive or negative framing without engaging with the complexity of different experiences and perspectives; Making sweeping judgements about 'the empire' without recognising that imperial experience varied enormously by place, period and social group |

### Secondary concept: Constructing Historical Arguments (HI-KS3-C004)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

A historical argument is a structured, evidenced response to a historical question, in which a thesis is developed, supported by selected and evaluated evidence, and qualified where necessary by consideration of counter-evidence or alternative interpretations. Constructing historical arguments requires integrating all the second-order concepts of the discipline: chronological knowledge, causal understanding, appreciation of significance, ability to evaluate evidence and awareness of interpretive diversity. At KS3, pupils are expected to construct extended historical arguments in both oral discussion and extended writing.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can write about historical events in a descriptive, narrative way but struggles to organise information around an argument or answer a specific historical question analytically. | Describing what happened rather than explaining why it was significant; Not developing points beyond a single sentence |
| **Developing** | Can structure a response around a historical question, making a clear point supported by evidence, though arguments may be one-sided and evidence may not be fully explained. | Only explaining one cause without considering alternative factors; Asserting that something was important without explaining the mechanism by which it led to the outcome |
| **Secure** | Can construct a sustained historical argument with a clear thesis, deploying selected evidence to support the argument and addressing counter-evidence or alternative interpretations. | Making a one-sided argument without acknowledging counter-evidence; Including evidence that is not explicitly linked to the argument being made |
| **Mastery** | Can construct a sophisticated, multi-layered historical argument that integrates multiple second-order concepts, evaluates competing interpretations, and demonstrates awareness of the limits of historical knowledge. | Agreeing or disagreeing with the claim without establishing and applying criteria for assessing significance; Treating the different types of consequence as separate rather than analysing how they interconnected |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** The Holocaust requires pupils to trace a causal sequence from the conditions that enabled Nazi ideology to take hold, through the escalating persecution, to systematic genocide — and to evaluate the role of individual choices, institutional failures and international inaction in enabling each step.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- Does this show a cause, or just a correlation?
- What is the mechanism — how exactly does A lead to B?
- Which factor had the biggest effect, and how could you tell?
- What evidence would you need to prove this was the cause?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Constructing extended written responses that use second-order concepts to answer historical questions with a structured, evidenced thesis is the most direct application of evidence_argument reasoning in the curriculum — pupils must move from source handling to analytical claim-making in a sustained piece of writing.

## Session structure: Topic Study + Source Enquiry

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Topic Study (main structure)
A structured enquiry into a defined topic, period, or place. Begins with an engaging hook to capture interest, builds contextual knowledge, moves through source analysis and interpretation, and culminates in a substantiated argument or conclusion. The core humanities template.

`hook` → `context` → `source_analysis` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Extended writing task presenting a reasoned argument supported by evidence from the topic. Can take the form of an essay, structured explanation, or debate position.

**Teacher note:** Use the TOPIC STUDY template: frame the session around a substantive historical, geographical, or ethical question. Contextualise using relevant background and terminology. Provide a range of sources for structured analysis, prompting pupils to evaluate reliability and typicality. Expect pupils to construct an evidence-based argument that addresses the enquiry question.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How reliable is this source for answering our enquiry question?
- What contextual factors might explain this interpretation?
- How would you weigh the evidence from these different sources?
- What argument would you construct, and what counter-argument must you address?

### Source Enquiry
A disciplinary history enquiry centred on working with primary and secondary sources. Pupils select relevant sources, contextualise them within their historical period, interrogate them for reliability, utility, and bias, cross-reference between sources, interpret what they reveal, and construct an argument based on the evidence.

`source_selection` → `contextualisation` → `interrogation` → `cross_referencing` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Source-based extended writing that demonstrates ability to analyse provenance, cross-reference sources, reach substantiated interpretations, and construct a historical argument.

**Teacher note:** Use the SOURCE ENQUIRY template: provide a range of primary and secondary sources relevant to a focused enquiry question. Guide pupils through contextualisation, interrogation of content and provenance, and systematic cross-referencing. Expect pupils to evaluate the utility and reliability of each source for the specific enquiry, and to construct an evidence-based interpretation.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How useful is this source for our specific enquiry question?
- What does the provenance of this source tell us about its reliability?
- Where do these sources corroborate or contradict each other?
- What interpretation does the balance of evidence support?

## Primary sources

2 historically grounded source types are available for this study:

### 1. Anne Frank's Diary (Testimony, )
The diary of Anne Frank, a Jewish girl who hid with her family in a secret annex in Amsterdam for two years during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. She was 13 when she began writing. The diary records her daily life, fears, hopes and reflections. Anne died in Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945. Her father Otto Frank, the sole survivor of the family, published the diary in 1947.

**How to use:** Read an extract that shows Anne as a normal teenager (arguing with her mother, thinking about school, writing about her feelings). Ask: 'What does reading Anne's diary tell us that statistics about the Holocaust cannot?' Develop the concept that testimony gives us the human reality behind the numbers. Then: 'Anne wrote her diary hoping it would be published after the war. How does that affect what she wrote?'

**Location:** Anne Frank House, Amsterdam (original diary); widely published
**URL:** https://www.annefrank.org/en/

### 2. Nuremberg Trial Transcripts and Documents (Primary Legal, )
The official transcripts of the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg (1945-46), which tried 24 major Nazi war criminals. The trial produced an enormous documentary record including filmed testimony, captured Nazi documents, and the transcripts of the proceedings themselves. The trial established the concept of 'crimes against humanity' in international law.

**How to use:** Use simplified extracts of testimony or documentary evidence presented at the trial. Ask: 'Why was it important to hold a trial rather than simply punishing the Nazi leaders?' Develop the concept that legal proceedings produce a specific kind of historical evidence: sworn testimony, cross-examination, documentary proof. Then: 'The trial created the concept of crimes against humanity. Why was a new legal concept needed?'

**Location:** United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Washington DC; International Court of Justice, The Hague; Nuremberg Palace of Justice

## Disciplinary concepts foregrounded

| Concept | Key question | Role in this study |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Cause and Consequence | Why did this happen, and what were the effects? | At KS3, pupils should construct multi-causal explanations showing how ideology, propaganda, bureaucracy and individual choices combined to produce genocide. |
| Evidence and Interpretation | How do we know about this, and how do historians disagree? | At KS3, pupils must learn to use testimony as a distinct source type, understanding its strengths (personal experience, emotional truth) and limitations (memory, selectivity). |
| Significance | Why does this matter, and to whom? | At KS3, evaluate why the Holocaust is the only event specifically named in the KS3 curriculum. What makes it uniquely significant? |

## Key figures and events

**Key figures:** Anne Frank, Primo Levi, Oskar Schindler, Kindertransport children

**Key events:**
- Nuremberg Laws 1935
- Kristallnacht 1938
- Kindertransport 1938-39
- Wannsee Conference 1942
- Liberation of Auschwitz 1945

**Period:** 1933 - 1945

**Perspectives to include:** Jewish victim, rescuer, bystander, perpetrator, liberator

**Significance claim:** The Holocaust is the defining moral catastrophe of the twentieth century, and understanding how it happened is essential for developing the vigilance and values needed to prevent future genocides.

**Historiographical debate:**
- The question of when the Nazi regime decided on the 'Final Solution' (intentionalist vs functionalist debate) remains a central historiographical discussion
- Historians debate the extent to which ordinary Germans knew about and participated in the Holocaust

---

## Why this study matters

Teaching about the Holocaust develops pupils' understanding of how ideology, propaganda, dehumanisation and bureaucracy can combine to produce genocide. It connects to broader themes of human rights, prejudice and the responsibilities of citizenship.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Jumping straight to death camps without teaching the gradual escalation from discrimination to genocide
2. Reducing the Holocaust to statistics rather than using individual testimony to establish the human reality
3. Treating the Holocaust as inevitable rather than examining choices made at each stage
4. Using graphic imagery without pedagogical justification; the UCL Centre advises against shock tactics

## Sensitive content

- This topic requires particular sensitivity and careful planning; follow UCL Centre for Holocaust Education and Holocaust Educational Trust guidance
- Be aware of Jewish pupils who may have family connections to the Holocaust
- Avoid comparisons that trivialise the Holocaust; use precise historical language
- The perpetrator/bystander/rescuer framework should not be a simple moral judgement exercise
- Some pupils may find testimony and images distressing; prepare them and provide support
- Roma, disabled, LGBT+ and other victim groups should not be omitted from the narrative

## Historical thinking skills (KS3)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Chronological understanding** — Understand and use chronological frameworks to sequence events, periods and changes over time; develop a chronologically secure knowledge of British, local and world history using historical time vocabulary with increasing precision; construct and interpret timelines that place events in meaningful relation to each other.
- **Causation and consequence** — Understand why historical events and changes happened by identifying and explaining multiple causes; assess the intended and unintended consequences of events and decisions; distinguish between long-term structural factors and immediate triggers; construct causal arguments using historical evidence.
- **Change and continuity** — Identify what changed and what remained constant across historical periods; assess the pace, nature and extent of change; distinguish between long-term trends and short-term fluctuations; understand that change can be experienced differently by different groups within the same society.
- **Similarity and difference** — Identify and explain similarities and differences within and across historical periods, societies and cultures; avoid anachronism by understanding people's lives and choices within their own contexts; make valid comparisons that illuminate both the distinctiveness of periods and the common threads of human experience.
- **Historical significance** — Assess the significance of historical events, people and developments using explicit criteria such as scale of impact, duration, number of people affected, degree of change caused, and how an event is remembered and commemorated; understand that significance is not fixed but is constructed and contested by historians and societies over time.
- **Historical evidence** — Locate, select and use a range of primary and secondary historical sources; understand provenance and evaluate a source's utility and reliability in relation to a specific enquiry; corroborate claims across multiple sources; recognise that all sources are partial and that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
