## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Power, Monarchy and Democracy (HI-KS3-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The history of political power in Britain is the story of the transformation from absolute monarchy to parliamentary democracy over approximately a thousand years. Key stages include the limitation of royal power by Magna Carta (1215), the development of Parliament, the English Civil War and execution of Charles I, the Glorious Revolution and constitutional monarchy, the gradual extension of the franchise, and the welfare state. Understanding this progression requires analysis of the forces that drove change - economic development, religious conflict, intellectual movements, social pressure - and the contested nature of each advance.

**Teaching guidance:** Build an explicit narrative of the development of British democracy as a thread running through medieval and early modern history. Study key moments of constitutional change in depth: Magna Carta, the Civil War, the Glorious Revolution, the Reform Acts, universal suffrage. Analyse the arguments of those who resisted and those who demanded change. Connect to pupils' understanding of current democratic institutions: Parliament, elections, rights. Compare British constitutional development with developments in other countries.

**Key vocabulary:** monarchy, parliament, democracy, constitution, rights, revolution, reform, franchise, suffrage, civil war, constitutional, feudal, Magna Carta, sovereignty, power

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may see the development of democracy as inevitable or straightforward. The contested, reversible nature of each advance - and the real possibility that different outcomes were possible - develops more sophisticated historical understanding. Pupils may present Magna Carta as establishing democracy; in reality it was a document protecting baronial privilege, and its later association with rights is a product of subsequent reinterpretation. The diversity of attitudes to democracy across different social groups at each stage of change needs explicit attention.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify some key events in British political history (e.g. Magna Carta, the Civil War) and recognise that Britain is a democracy, but struggles to explain how political power changed over time. | Name two events that were important in the development of democracy in Britain. | Listing events without explaining their connection to the development of democracy; Assuming Magna Carta created democracy rather than being one step in a long process |
| **Developing** | Can describe several stages in the development of British democracy and explain basic cause-and-effect relationships between events, with some understanding that change was contested and gradual. | Explain how the English Civil War changed the balance of power between Parliament and the monarchy. | Describing the Civil War as a simple fight between two sides without explaining the underlying political dispute; Not connecting the Civil War to the longer story of constitutional development |
| **Secure** | Can construct a clear narrative of constitutional change across the medieval and early modern periods, explaining multiple causes of change and analysing how different social groups experienced and drove political transformation. | How far was the development of democracy in Britain a story of steady progress? Use examples from at least three different periods to support your argument. | Presenting constitutional development as an inevitable march towards democracy without acknowledging resistance and reversals; Focusing only on political events without considering the economic and social forces driving change |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate competing historical interpretations of British constitutional development, assess the relative significance of different factors driving change, and make connections between British and comparative international developments. | Some historians argue that the development of British democracy was driven primarily by pressure from below (popular movements), while others argue it was shaped by decisions from above (elite concessions). Which interpretation do you find more convincing, and why? | Accepting one interpretation uncritically without evaluating the evidence for and against it; Not using specific historical evidence to support the evaluation of competing interpretations |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Magna Carta in 1215 limited the power of the king. The English Civil War in the 1640s led to Parliament becoming more powerful than the monarch.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Before the Civil War, Charles I believed in the divine right of kings and tried to rule without Parliament. Parliament fought against him because they wanted a say in how the country was governed, especially over taxation. After Parliament won the war, Charles I was executed in 1649, showing that even a king could be held accountable. Although the monarchy was restored in 1660, Parliament kept more power than before. The Glorious Revolution of 1688 then confirmed that Parliament, not the monarch, was the supreme authority.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *The development of British democracy was not a story of steady progress but of contested, uneven change with significant setbacks. Magna Carta (1215) limited royal power, but it protected baronial privilege, not ordinary people's rights. The Peasants' Revolt (1381) showed that common people demanded a voice, but it was violently suppressed. The Civil War and Glorious Revolution (1640s-1688) established parliamentary sovereignty, but Parliament represented only wealthy men. The Reform Acts of the 19th century gradually extended the franchise, but universal suffrage was not achieved until 1928. At each stage, those in power resisted change and those demanding it faced real risk. Progress was driven by economic change, religious conflict, intellectual movements like the Enlightenment, and sustained pressure from excluded groups. The outcome was never inevitable.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Both interpretations capture part of the truth, but neither is sufficient alone. The 'pressure from below' interpretation correctly identifies moments when popular action forced change: the Peasants' Revolt challenged feudal assumptions, Chartism created mass political consciousness, and the suffragette movement made women's exclusion untenable. However, the 'concessions from above' interpretation explains why change took the specific forms it did: the Great Reform Act of 1832 was carefully designed by elites to extend just enough franchise to defuse revolutionary pressure while preserving their own dominance. The most convincing interpretation is that democratic development resulted from the interaction between popular pressure and elite calculation. Elites conceded reform when the cost of resistance exceeded the cost of concession, but the timing, form and extent of reform were shaped by the strength and organisation of popular movements. Comparing with France, where elite resistance to reform led to violent revolution, suggests that the British pattern of incremental concession was contingent on the specific balance of political forces rather than being an inherent national characteristic.*

### Secondary concept: Constructing Historical Arguments (HI-KS3-C004)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

A historical argument is a structured, evidenced response to a historical question, in which a thesis is developed, supported by selected and evaluated evidence, and qualified where necessary by consideration of counter-evidence or alternative interpretations. Constructing historical arguments requires integrating all the second-order concepts of the discipline: chronological knowledge, causal understanding, appreciation of significance, ability to evaluate evidence and awareness of interpretive diversity. At KS3, pupils are expected to construct extended historical arguments in both oral discussion and extended writing.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can write about historical events in a descriptive, narrative way but struggles to organise information around an argument or answer a specific historical question analytically. | Describing what happened rather than explaining why it was significant; Not developing points beyond a single sentence |
| **Developing** | Can structure a response around a historical question, making a clear point supported by evidence, though arguments may be one-sided and evidence may not be fully explained. | Only explaining one cause without considering alternative factors; Asserting that something was important without explaining the mechanism by which it led to the outcome |
| **Secure** | Can construct a sustained historical argument with a clear thesis, deploying selected evidence to support the argument and addressing counter-evidence or alternative interpretations. | Making a one-sided argument without acknowledging counter-evidence; Including evidence that is not explicitly linked to the argument being made |
| **Mastery** | Can construct a sophisticated, multi-layered historical argument that integrates multiple second-order concepts, evaluates competing interpretations, and demonstrates awareness of the limits of historical knowledge. | Agreeing or disagreeing with the claim without establishing and applying criteria for assessing significance; Treating the different types of consequence as separate rather than analysing how they interconnected |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Each constitutional turning point (the English Civil War, the Glorious Revolution, the Great Reform Act) requires pupils to explain what caused power to shift, which actors drove change, and what the long-run consequences were for the distribution of political authority.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- Does this show a cause, or just a correlation?
- What is the mechanism — how exactly does A lead to B?
- Which factor had the biggest effect, and how could you tell?
- What evidence would you need to prove this was the cause?

**Secondary lens:** Continuity and Change Over Time — The eight-century arc from Norman kingship to modern democracy is an extended continuity_change analysis — pupils must identify the moments of genuine constitutional rupture (Magna Carta, Civil War, Reform Acts) and distinguish them from periods of apparent stability where underlying power relations were shifting incrementally.

## Session structure: Topic Study + Source Enquiry

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Topic Study (main structure)
A structured enquiry into a defined topic, period, or place. Begins with an engaging hook to capture interest, builds contextual knowledge, moves through source analysis and interpretation, and culminates in a substantiated argument or conclusion. The core humanities template.

`hook` → `context` → `source_analysis` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Extended writing task presenting a reasoned argument supported by evidence from the topic. Can take the form of an essay, structured explanation, or debate position.

**Teacher note:** Use the TOPIC STUDY template: frame the session around a substantive historical, geographical, or ethical question. Contextualise using relevant background and terminology. Provide a range of sources for structured analysis, prompting pupils to evaluate reliability and typicality. Expect pupils to construct an evidence-based argument that addresses the enquiry question.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How reliable is this source for answering our enquiry question?
- What contextual factors might explain this interpretation?
- How would you weigh the evidence from these different sources?
- What argument would you construct, and what counter-argument must you address?

### Source Enquiry
A disciplinary history enquiry centred on working with primary and secondary sources. Pupils select relevant sources, contextualise them within their historical period, interrogate them for reliability, utility, and bias, cross-reference between sources, interpret what they reveal, and construct an argument based on the evidence.

`source_selection` → `contextualisation` → `interrogation` → `cross_referencing` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Source-based extended writing that demonstrates ability to analyse provenance, cross-reference sources, reach substantiated interpretations, and construct a historical argument.

**Teacher note:** Use the SOURCE ENQUIRY template: provide a range of primary and secondary sources relevant to a focused enquiry question. Guide pupils through contextualisation, interrogation of content and provenance, and systematic cross-referencing. Expect pupils to evaluate the utility and reliability of each source for the specific enquiry, and to construct an evidence-based interpretation.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How useful is this source for our specific enquiry question?
- What does the provenance of this source tell us about its reliability?
- Where do these sources corroborate or contradict each other?
- What interpretation does the balance of evidence support?

## Disciplinary concepts foregrounded

| Concept | Key question | Role in this study |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Cause and Consequence | Why did this happen, and what were the effects? | At KS3, construct multi-causal arguments about the Civil War: religious, political, economic and personal factors. Evaluate which was most important. |
| Change and Continuity | What changed, what stayed the same, and why? | At KS3, assess whether the constitutional changes of this period were revolutionary or evolutionary. Was the Restoration a reversal or continuation? |
| Significance | Why does this matter, and to whom? | At KS3, evaluate the significance of the execution of Charles I: was it a turning point in the history of British democracy? |
| Evidence and Interpretation | How do we know about this, and how do historians disagree? | At KS3, analyse Civil War pamphlets and newsbooks as propaganda sources. Why were they created and how reliable are they? |

## Key figures and events

**Key figures:** Henry VIII, Thomas Cromwell, Oliver Cromwell, Charles I, William III

**Key events:**
- English Reformation 1534
- English Civil War 1642-1651
- Execution of Charles I 1649
- Restoration of Charles II 1660
- Glorious Revolution 1688

**Period:** 1509 - 1745

**Perspectives to include:** monarch, Parliamentary supporter, Royalist supporter, ordinary citizen, religious dissenter

**Significance claim:** The constitutional crises of 1509-1745 established the principle that the monarch rules under the law and through Parliament, creating the framework of British constitutional governance that endures today.

**Historiographical debate:**
- Whether the English Civil War was primarily a religious, political or social conflict remains the central historiographical debate about the period
- Historians disagree on whether the Glorious Revolution was genuinely revolutionary or a conservative restoration of the status quo

---

## Why this study matters

This period encompasses the most dramatic constitutional crises in British history: the break with Rome, the execution of a king, the republic, and the establishment of constitutional monarchy. These events are essential for understanding modern British governance.

---

## Sequencing

**Follows:** Medieval Britain 1066-1509
**Leads to:** Ideas, Power, Industry and Empire 1745-1901

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Presenting the English Civil War as simply Roundheads vs Cavaliers rather than examining its complex causes
2. Treating the Glorious Revolution as bloodless and universally welcomed, ignoring its impact on Ireland and Scotland
3. Reducing the Reformation to Henry VIII's marriages rather than examining the profound social and cultural transformation

## Sensitive content

- The English Civil War involved significant violence and social disruption; present with nuance
- Religious persecution (of Catholics and Dissenters) should be discussed sensitively
- The Glorious Revolution's impact on Ireland (Battle of the Boyne, Penal Laws) remains politically sensitive

## Historical thinking skills (KS3)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Chronological understanding** — Understand and use chronological frameworks to sequence events, periods and changes over time; develop a chronologically secure knowledge of British, local and world history using historical time vocabulary with increasing precision; construct and interpret timelines that place events in meaningful relation to each other.
- **Causation and consequence** — Understand why historical events and changes happened by identifying and explaining multiple causes; assess the intended and unintended consequences of events and decisions; distinguish between long-term structural factors and immediate triggers; construct causal arguments using historical evidence.
- **Change and continuity** — Identify what changed and what remained constant across historical periods; assess the pace, nature and extent of change; distinguish between long-term trends and short-term fluctuations; understand that change can be experienced differently by different groups within the same society.
- **Similarity and difference** — Identify and explain similarities and differences within and across historical periods, societies and cultures; avoid anachronism by understanding people's lives and choices within their own contexts; make valid comparisons that illuminate both the distinctiveness of periods and the common threads of human experience.
- **Historical significance** — Assess the significance of historical events, people and developments using explicit criteria such as scale of impact, duration, number of people affected, degree of change caused, and how an event is remembered and commemorated; understand that significance is not fixed but is constructed and contested by historians and societies over time.
- **Historical evidence** — Locate, select and use a range of primary and secondary historical sources; understand provenance and evaluate a source's utility and reliability in relation to a specific enquiry; corroborate claims across multiple sources; recognise that all sources are partial and that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
