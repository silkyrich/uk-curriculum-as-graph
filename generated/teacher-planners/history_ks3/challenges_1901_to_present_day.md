## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **3 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Empire, Colonialism and its Consequences (HI-KS3-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The British Empire was at its height one of the largest empires in history, eventually covering approximately a quarter of the world's land surface. Its creation involved trade, conquest, settlement and the exploitation of colonised peoples and their resources. The transatlantic slave trade was an integral part of the economic system of empire. Decolonisation in the twentieth century dismantled formal imperial structures, but the legacies of empire - in patterns of global inequality, migration, cultural exchange and political boundaries - remain central to understanding the contemporary world. At KS3, pupils develop analytical understanding of empire as a global historical force with enduring consequences.

**Teaching guidance:** Study the British Empire across its full chronology: early trading relationships, plantation colonies, conquest of India, the Victorian empire, decolonisation. Connect to the transatlantic slave trade: its scale, mechanisms, economic importance and human consequences. Explore the experiences of colonised peoples as well as colonisers. Study decolonisation: what drove it? Who resisted? What did newly independent states inherit? Connect imperial history to contemporary issues: migration, diversity, global inequality. Be alert to and challenge triumphalist or apologetic framings that oversimplify complex history.

**Key vocabulary:** empire, colonialism, imperialism, slave trade, plantation, colony, decolonisation, independence, exploitation, resistance, trade, legacy, migration, inequality, heritage

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may have received simplified positive or negative narratives about empire. Developing a more complex, evidence-based understanding that acknowledges both the violence and exploitation of empire and the complex ways in which colonised peoples responded to and shaped imperial history is the educational goal. The slave trade is sometimes treated as separate from empire; integrating it as a foundational element of the economic and social history of empire gives it appropriate centrality.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify that Britain had an empire and that the slave trade was part of it, but has limited factual knowledge of the chronology, geography and mechanisms of empire. | What was the British Empire? Name one way it affected people in other countries. | Describing the empire in very general terms without specific examples or dates; Not recognising that the slave trade involved the forced transportation of millions of people over centuries |
| **Developing** | Can describe the main phases of the British Empire chronologically and explain the role of the slave trade as an economic system, with some understanding of both colonial and colonised perspectives. | Explain how the transatlantic slave trade worked as an economic system and why it was important to the British Empire. | Describing the slave trade without explaining its economic function within the wider empire; Not mentioning the human suffering and mortality of the Middle Passage |
| **Secure** | Can analyse the causes and consequences of British imperialism across multiple periods, explain the experiences of colonised peoples alongside those of colonisers, and evaluate the process of decolonisation. | Why did the British Empire come to an end in the twentieth century? Consider both the actions of colonised peoples and the changing position of Britain. | Attributing decolonisation entirely to British generosity rather than recognising the agency of independence movements; Not explaining the lasting legacies of empire in shaping post-colonial societies |
| **Mastery** | Can critically evaluate different historical interpretations of the British Empire, assess its long-term significance using explicit criteria, and connect imperial history to contemporary global issues with analytical sophistication. | How should we assess the historical significance of the British Empire? Is it possible to reach a balanced judgement about whether the empire was, on balance, beneficial or harmful? | Adopting an uncritically positive or negative framing without engaging with the complexity of different experiences and perspectives; Making sweeping judgements about 'the empire' without recognising that imperial experience varied enormously by place, period and social group |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *The British Empire was when Britain controlled many countries around the world. One way it affected people was through the slave trade, where millions of African people were captured and forced to work on plantations in the Caribbean and America.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *The transatlantic slave trade operated as a triangular trade system. British ships sailed to West Africa carrying manufactured goods, which were exchanged for enslaved people. The enslaved people were transported across the Atlantic on the Middle Passage to Caribbean and American colonies, where they were sold. The ships then returned to Britain carrying sugar, tobacco and cotton produced by enslaved labour. This system made enormous profits for British traders, plantation owners and port cities like Liverpool and Bristol. The slave trade was central to the British economy in the 17th and 18th centuries because the plantation colonies produced raw materials that fuelled British industry and trade.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Decolonisation resulted from the interaction of multiple factors. Colonised peoples increasingly organised resistance movements demanding independence, drawing on ideas of self-determination and national identity. In India, the independence movement led by figures like Gandhi and Nehru used both non-violent protest and political organisation to make British rule unsustainable. The Second World War weakened Britain economically and militarily, making it harder to maintain control over a vast empire. The war also undermined the moral justification for empire, since Britain had fought against Nazi imperialism while maintaining its own colonies. The Cold War created pressure from both the USA and USSR, which opposed European colonialism for their own strategic reasons. Independence movements in Africa accelerated in the 1950s and 1960s, sometimes through negotiation and sometimes through armed struggle. Decolonisation did not end imperial influence: newly independent states inherited borders drawn by colonial powers, economies structured around colonial trade patterns, and political institutions shaped by colonial administration.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Assessing the significance of the British Empire requires distinguishing between its impact at the time and its long-term legacy, and recognising that impact differed enormously depending on whose perspective we adopt. For many colonised peoples, empire involved violence, exploitation, cultural destruction and economic extraction: the Bengal Famine of 1943, the suppression of the Mau Mau uprising, and the systematic extraction of resources from colonies were profoundly harmful. For Britain, empire generated enormous wealth, global influence and cultural reach. Some argue that empire also brought infrastructure, legal systems and education to colonies, but this 'balance sheet' approach is problematic because it treats colonial development as compensation for colonial exploitation, and because much colonial infrastructure was built to serve colonial economic interests, not the needs of local populations. The question of whether empire was 'beneficial or harmful' may itself be misleading, because it implies a single judgement can encompass the experiences of hundreds of millions of people across three centuries. A more historically productive approach is to examine specific consequences in specific contexts, using criteria such as scale of impact, duration, and significance for subsequent developments. The most important legacy may be structural: the patterns of global inequality, migration, cultural exchange and political boundaries that shape the contemporary world were all profoundly shaped by empire.*

### Secondary concept: Power, Monarchy and Democracy (HI-KS3-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The history of political power in Britain is the story of the transformation from absolute monarchy to parliamentary democracy over approximately a thousand years. Key stages include the limitation of royal power by Magna Carta (1215), the development of Parliament, the English Civil War and execution of Charles I, the Glorious Revolution and constitutional monarchy, the gradual extension of the franchise, and the welfare state. Understanding this progression requires analysis of the forces that drove change - economic development, religious conflict, intellectual movements, social pressure - and the contested nature of each advance.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify some key events in British political history (e.g. Magna Carta, the Civil War) and recognise that Britain is a democracy, but struggles to explain how political power changed over time. | Listing events without explaining their connection to the development of democracy; Assuming Magna Carta created democracy rather than being one step in a long process |
| **Developing** | Can describe several stages in the development of British democracy and explain basic cause-and-effect relationships between events, with some understanding that change was contested and gradual. | Describing the Civil War as a simple fight between two sides without explaining the underlying political dispute; Not connecting the Civil War to the longer story of constitutional development |
| **Secure** | Can construct a clear narrative of constitutional change across the medieval and early modern periods, explaining multiple causes of change and analysing how different social groups experienced and drove political transformation. | Presenting constitutional development as an inevitable march towards democracy without acknowledging resistance and reversals; Focusing only on political events without considering the economic and social forces driving change |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate competing historical interpretations of British constitutional development, assess the relative significance of different factors driving change, and make connections between British and comparative international developments. | Accepting one interpretation uncritically without evaluating the evidence for and against it; Not using specific historical evidence to support the evaluation of competing interpretations |

### Secondary concept: The Holocaust: Understanding Genocide (HI-KS3-C003)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The Holocaust was the systematic, state-sponsored persecution and murder of six million Jews by the Nazi regime and its collaborators between 1933 and 1945. It also included the murder of millions of others: Roma, disabled people, Soviet prisoners of war, political opponents, gay men. Understanding the Holocaust requires knowledge of the specific historical context (Weimar Germany, the rise of Nazism, antisemitism), the mechanisms of persecution (propaganda, legal discrimination, ghettoisation, deportation, mass murder), and the responses of bystanders, collaborators, resisters and rescuers. It also requires engagement with the moral questions the Holocaust raises about human nature, responsibility and the fragility of civilisation.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify the Holocaust as an event in which millions of Jewish people were killed by the Nazis during the Second World War, but has limited understanding of how persecution escalated or why it happened. | Stating the facts of mass murder without any understanding of how persecution escalated over time; Not recognising that the Holocaust targeted multiple groups alongside the Jewish people |
| **Developing** | Can describe the escalation of persecution from legal discrimination to mass murder, identify key stages in the process, and explain the role of Nazi ideology in motivating the Holocaust. | Jumping straight to the death camps without explaining the years of escalating persecution that preceded them; Treating the Holocaust as inevitable rather than as the result of specific decisions and choices |
| **Secure** | Can analyse the roles of different groups in the Holocaust (perpetrators, bystanders, collaborators, resisters, rescuers), explain the conditions that made genocide possible, and engage thoughtfully with the moral complexity of the period. | Portraying all Germans as either knowing perpetrators or completely ignorant, ignoring the complex spectrum of responses; Not acknowledging the existence of resistance and rescue alongside complicity and collaboration |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate different historical interpretations of the Holocaust, connect it to broader questions about genocide and human rights, and critically assess its significance for the contemporary world using explicit criteria. | Treating the debate as merely academic without recognising the moral and political stakes involved; Making comparisons that trivialise the Holocaust or that dismiss the experiences of victims of other genocides |

### Secondary concept: Constructing Historical Arguments (HI-KS3-C004)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

A historical argument is a structured, evidenced response to a historical question, in which a thesis is developed, supported by selected and evaluated evidence, and qualified where necessary by consideration of counter-evidence or alternative interpretations. Constructing historical arguments requires integrating all the second-order concepts of the discipline: chronological knowledge, causal understanding, appreciation of significance, ability to evaluate evidence and awareness of interpretive diversity. At KS3, pupils are expected to construct extended historical arguments in both oral discussion and extended writing.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can write about historical events in a descriptive, narrative way but struggles to organise information around an argument or answer a specific historical question analytically. | Describing what happened rather than explaining why it was significant; Not developing points beyond a single sentence |
| **Developing** | Can structure a response around a historical question, making a clear point supported by evidence, though arguments may be one-sided and evidence may not be fully explained. | Only explaining one cause without considering alternative factors; Asserting that something was important without explaining the mechanism by which it led to the outcome |
| **Secure** | Can construct a sustained historical argument with a clear thesis, deploying selected evidence to support the argument and addressing counter-evidence or alternative interpretations. | Making a one-sided argument without acknowledging counter-evidence; Including evidence that is not explicitly linked to the argument being made |
| **Mastery** | Can construct a sophisticated, multi-layered historical argument that integrates multiple second-order concepts, evaluates competing interpretations, and demonstrates awareness of the limits of historical knowledge. | Agreeing or disagreeing with the claim without establishing and applying criteria for assessing significance; Treating the different types of consequence as separate rather than analysing how they interconnected |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Each constitutional turning point (the English Civil War, the Glorious Revolution, the Great Reform Act) requires pupils to explain what caused power to shift, which actors drove change, and what the long-run consequences were for the distribution of political authority.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- Does this show a cause, or just a correlation?
- What is the mechanism — how exactly does A lead to B?
- Which factor had the biggest effect, and how could you tell?
- What evidence would you need to prove this was the cause?

**Secondary lens:** Continuity and Change Over Time — The eight-century arc from Norman kingship to modern democracy is an extended continuity_change analysis — pupils must identify the moments of genuine constitutional rupture (Magna Carta, Civil War, Reform Acts) and distinguish them from periods of apparent stability where underlying power relations were shifting incrementally.

## Session structure: Topic Study + Source Enquiry

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Topic Study (main structure)
A structured enquiry into a defined topic, period, or place. Begins with an engaging hook to capture interest, builds contextual knowledge, moves through source analysis and interpretation, and culminates in a substantiated argument or conclusion. The core humanities template.

`hook` → `context` → `source_analysis` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Extended writing task presenting a reasoned argument supported by evidence from the topic. Can take the form of an essay, structured explanation, or debate position.

**Teacher note:** Use the TOPIC STUDY template: frame the session around a substantive historical, geographical, or ethical question. Contextualise using relevant background and terminology. Provide a range of sources for structured analysis, prompting pupils to evaluate reliability and typicality. Expect pupils to construct an evidence-based argument that addresses the enquiry question.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How reliable is this source for answering our enquiry question?
- What contextual factors might explain this interpretation?
- How would you weigh the evidence from these different sources?
- What argument would you construct, and what counter-argument must you address?

### Source Enquiry
A disciplinary history enquiry centred on working with primary and secondary sources. Pupils select relevant sources, contextualise them within their historical period, interrogate them for reliability, utility, and bias, cross-reference between sources, interpret what they reveal, and construct an argument based on the evidence.

`source_selection` → `contextualisation` → `interrogation` → `cross_referencing` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Source-based extended writing that demonstrates ability to analyse provenance, cross-reference sources, reach substantiated interpretations, and construct a historical argument.

**Teacher note:** Use the SOURCE ENQUIRY template: provide a range of primary and secondary sources relevant to a focused enquiry question. Guide pupils through contextualisation, interrogation of content and provenance, and systematic cross-referencing. Expect pupils to evaluate the utility and reliability of each source for the specific enquiry, and to construct an evidence-based interpretation.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How useful is this source for our specific enquiry question?
- What does the provenance of this source tell us about its reliability?
- Where do these sources corroborate or contradict each other?
- What interpretation does the balance of evidence support?

## Disciplinary concepts foregrounded

| Concept | Key question | Role in this study |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Cause and Consequence | Why did this happen, and what were the effects? | At KS3, construct sustained causal arguments about 20th-century conflicts and their consequences, weighing multiple factors. |
| Change and Continuity | What changed, what stayed the same, and why? | At KS3, evaluate how far Britain changed during the 20th century: from empire to multicultural democracy. What continuities persist? |
| Evidence and Interpretation | How do we know about this, and how do historians disagree? | At KS3, evaluate propaganda posters, newsreel footage and oral histories critically. What can they tell us and what are their limitations? |
| Significance | Why does this matter, and to whom? | At KS3, evaluate the significance of decolonisation, Windrush and the reshaping of British identity. |

## Key figures and events

**Key figures:** Winston Churchill, Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr, Nelson Mandela

**Key events:**
- World War I 1914-18
- World War II 1939-45
- Indian independence 1947
- Windrush 1948
- Fall of Berlin Wall 1989

**Period:** 1901 - present

**Perspectives to include:** British soldier, civilian in the Blitz, colonial independence leader, Windrush generation, Holocaust survivor

**Significance claim:** The challenges of the twentieth century transformed Britain from the world's largest empire into a post-imperial, multicultural democracy, reshaping national identity, global relationships and the lives of every subsequent generation.

**Historiographical debate:**
- Whether World War I was a futile tragedy or a necessary response to German aggression remains one of the most contested questions in British public history
- The narrative of post-war Britain as a story of consensus and progress versus a story of inequality and racial tension continues to divide historians

---

## Why this study matters

The twentieth century is closest to pupils' own lives, and many will have family connections to the events studied. The World Wars provide powerful case studies for analysing propaganda. Decolonisation and post-war migration connect empire to the diverse Britain pupils live in today.

---

## Sequencing

**Follows:** Ideas, Power, Industry and Empire 1745-1901
**Leads to:** Crime and Punishment in Britain c1000-present

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Spending disproportionate time on military campaigns at the expense of social, political and cultural dimensions of the wars
2. Teaching the Windrush generation and decolonisation as footnotes rather than as central events
3. Using war poetry and propaganda uncritically as neutral sources

## Sensitive content

- War topics involve mass death, destruction and trauma; use age-appropriate sources and framing
- The Blitz, evacuee experiences and rationing may resonate with family stories; create space for personal connection
- Decolonisation and Windrush may connect to pupils' own family histories and racial identity; handle with sensitivity and respect
- The Holocaust is treated separately (HS-KS3-006) but contextualised within this broader 20th-century framework

---

## Historical thinking skills (KS3)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Chronological understanding** — Understand and use chronological frameworks to sequence events, periods and changes over time; develop a chronologically secure knowledge of British, local and world history using historical time vocabulary with increasing precision; construct and interpret timelines that place events in meaningful relation to each other.
- **Causation and consequence** — Understand why historical events and changes happened by identifying and explaining multiple causes; assess the intended and unintended consequences of events and decisions; distinguish between long-term structural factors and immediate triggers; construct causal arguments using historical evidence.
- **Change and continuity** — Identify what changed and what remained constant across historical periods; assess the pace, nature and extent of change; distinguish between long-term trends and short-term fluctuations; understand that change can be experienced differently by different groups within the same society.
- **Similarity and difference** — Identify and explain similarities and differences within and across historical periods, societies and cultures; avoid anachronism by understanding people's lives and choices within their own contexts; make valid comparisons that illuminate both the distinctiveness of periods and the common threads of human experience.
- **Historical significance** — Assess the significance of historical events, people and developments using explicit criteria such as scale of impact, duration, number of people affected, degree of change caused, and how an event is remembered and commemorated; understand that significance is not fixed but is constructed and contested by historians and societies over time.
- **Historical evidence** — Locate, select and use a range of primary and secondary historical sources; understand provenance and evaluate a source's utility and reliability in relation to a specific enquiry; corroborate claims across multiple sources; recognise that all sources are partial and that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
