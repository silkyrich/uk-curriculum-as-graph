## Enquiry questions

1. How can we measure and use the pH scale, and what happens during a neutralisation reaction?

---

## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **3 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Acids and alkalis (SC-KS3-C084)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Understanding acids and alkalis in terms of neutralization reactions

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce acids (pH < 7) and alkalis (pH > 7) using common examples: acids include vinegar (ethanoic acid), lemon juice (citric acid), stomach acid (hydrochloric acid); alkalis include soap, oven cleaner (sodium hydroxide), baking soda solution (sodium hydrogencarbonate). Demonstrate neutralisation: add an acid to an alkali with universal indicator to show the pH changing towards 7. The general equation is: acid + alkali → salt + water. Use this as the basis for understanding all acid reactions. Connect to the pH scale (SC-KS3-C085).

**Key vocabulary:** acid, alkali, base, neutral, neutralisation, pH, hydrogen ion, hydroxide ion, salt, water, reaction, indicator, universal indicator, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide, corrosive

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think all acids are dangerous and corrosive — many acids are weak and safe (citric acid in lemons, ethanoic acid in vinegar). Students may confuse 'strong' with 'concentrated' — a strong acid fully dissociates in water, a concentrated acid has a high amount of acid per unit volume. Students also sometimes think neutralisation always produces water that is safe to drink — the salt produced may be harmful.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knowing that acids taste sour and can be dangerous, while alkalis are the chemical opposite and are often found in cleaning products. | Name two acids and two alkalis you might find at home. | Thinking all acids are dangerous — many are safe (citric acid in lemons, ethanoic acid in vinegar); Confusing acids and alkalis — acids are sour, alkalis are bitter and slippery |
| **Developing** | Understanding that acids produce hydrogen ions in water and alkalis produce hydroxide ions, and that neutralisation occurs when they react. | What happens when an acid reacts with an alkali? Write a general equation. | Thinking neutralisation always produces table salt (NaCl) — the specific salt depends on the acid and alkali used; Not understanding that neutralisation is essentially H⁺ ions from the acid combining with OH⁻ ions from the alkali |
| **Secure** | Predicting the salt produced from a given acid-alkali combination and explaining practical applications of neutralisation. | Predict the salt produced when sulfuric acid reacts with potassium hydroxide. Explain the naming rule. | Not knowing which acid produces which type of salt — HCl → chloride, H₂SO₄ → sulfate, HNO₃ → nitrate; Forgetting to balance the equation — sulfuric acid is diprotic (two H⁺ ions) so needs 2 moles of KOH |
| **Mastery** | Distinguishing between strong and weak acids, concentrated and dilute acids, and evaluating pH in terms of hydrogen ion concentration. | Hydrochloric acid (HCl) and ethanoic acid (CH₃COOH) can both be at the same concentration, but HCl is a strong acid and ethanoic acid is a weak acid. Explain the difference and how it affects pH. | Confusing strong/weak (degree of dissociation) with concentrated/dilute (amount per volume); Thinking a weak acid is always less dangerous than a strong acid — a concentrated weak acid can still cause burns |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Acids: lemon juice (citric acid) and vinegar (ethanoic acid) — these taste sour. Alkalis: oven cleaner (sodium hydroxide) and bleach (sodium hypochlorite) — these feel slippery. Strong acids and alkalis can be corrosive and dangerous, but weak acids like those in food are safe.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *When an acid reacts with an alkali, they neutralise each other, producing a salt and water. General equation: acid + alkali → salt + water. For example: hydrochloric acid + sodium hydroxide → sodium chloride + water (HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H₂O). In water, the acid produces hydrogen ions (H⁺) and the alkali produces hydroxide ions (OH⁻). During neutralisation, H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O — the ions combine to form water, which is neutral.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Sulfuric acid + potassium hydroxide → potassium sulfate + water. H₂SO₄ + 2KOH → K₂SO₄ + 2H₂O. The naming rule: the metal comes from the alkali (potassium), and the type of salt comes from the acid — hydrochloric acid produces chlorides, sulfuric acid produces sulfates, nitric acid produces nitrates. Practical applications: antacid tablets neutralise excess stomach acid (HCl) with bases like magnesium hydroxide or calcium carbonate; farmers add lime (calcium hydroxide) to acidic soil to neutralise it for better crop growth; wastewater treatment uses neutralisation to bring effluent to safe pH before discharge.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *The distinction between strong and weak is about dissociation, not concentration. A strong acid (like HCl) fully dissociates in water — every HCl molecule splits into H⁺ and Cl⁻ ions. A weak acid (like ethanoic acid) only partially dissociates — most molecules remain intact as CH₃COOH, with only a small fraction splitting into H⁺ and CH₃COO⁻ ions. At the same concentration (e.g., 1 mol/dm³), HCl has a much higher H⁺ ion concentration than ethanoic acid, so HCl has a lower pH. This is separate from concentration, which describes how much acid is dissolved per unit volume. You can have concentrated weak acid (lots of ethanoic acid, still only partially dissociated) or dilute strong acid (a little HCl, but fully dissociated). A concentrated weak acid might have a similar pH to a dilute strong acid, but they would behave differently in reactions — the concentrated weak acid has a larger reserve of undissociated molecules that can dissociate as H⁺ ions are used up, giving it a buffering capacity. This distinction is crucial in biology (blood is buffered by weak acid/conjugate base systems) and in industry (choosing the right acid for the right application).*

### Secondary concept: pH scale (SC-KS3-C085)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Understanding the pH scale and indicators for measuring acidity and alkalinity

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knowing that the pH scale runs from 0 to 14, with acids below 7, neutral at 7, and alkalis above 7. | Thinking pH 0 means 'no acid' — pH 0 is extremely acidic; Confusing the direction of the scale — lower numbers are more acidic, not less acidic |
| **Developing** | Using indicators and pH meters to measure acidity, and understanding the colour changes of universal indicator across the pH range. | Thinking universal indicator only shows 'acid' or 'alkali' like litmus — it shows a range of pH values through colour; Not using a colour chart to determine pH — describing the colour without matching it to a number |
| **Secure** | Explaining the pH scale in terms of hydrogen ion concentration and understanding that it is a logarithmic scale. | Thinking pH is a simple linear scale where each unit represents the same change; Not realising that a change from pH 3 to pH 1 represents a 100-fold increase in H⁺ concentration, not just a doubling |
| **Mastery** | Calculating hydrogen ion concentration from pH, understanding the pH of strong and weak acids at the same concentration, and evaluating pH in industrial and environmental contexts. | Not converting the pH difference to a fold-change in H⁺ concentration using the logarithmic relationship; Thinking normal rain should be pH 7 — the natural dissolution of CO₂ makes it slightly acidic |

### Secondary concept: Acid-metal reactions (SC-KS3-C086)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Knowledge that acids react with metals to produce salt and hydrogen

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knowing that some metals fizz when placed in acid, producing a gas. | Not knowing that the gas produced is hydrogen; Thinking the metal disappears completely — it reacts to form a dissolved salt |
| **Developing** | Writing word and symbol equations for acid-metal reactions and testing for hydrogen gas. | Confusing the squeaky pop test for hydrogen with the relighting splint test for oxygen; Not knowing the general pattern: metal + acid → salt + hydrogen |
| **Secure** | Predicting whether a metal will react with an acid based on its position in the reactivity series, and explaining the reaction in terms of electron transfer. | Predicting copper will react with acid — copper, silver, and gold do not react with dilute acids; Not linking the reactivity series to electron transfer — more reactive metals lose electrons more easily |
| **Mastery** | Explaining reaction rates in acid-metal reactions, designing fair tests to investigate factors affecting rate, and connecting to industrial applications. | Not controlling surface area of the metal — a powder reacts faster than a ribbon due to greater surface area; Explaining rate differences only in terms of reactivity without connecting to collision theory (frequency of collisions between acid particles and metal surface) |

### Secondary concept: Neutralization (SC-KS3-C087)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Knowledge that acids react with alkalis to produce salt and water

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knowing that an acid and an alkali react together to cancel each other out, producing a neutral substance. | Thinking acids and alkalis are always dangerous when mixed — the products (salt and water) are usually safe; Not knowing that the process is called neutralisation |
| **Developing** | Writing equations for neutralisation reactions and predicting the salt formed from specific acid-alkali combinations. | Not recognising that nitric acid produces nitrates (not nitrides or nitrites); Forgetting to balance — Ca(OH)₂ needs 2HNO₃ because it has two hydroxide groups |
| **Secure** | Carrying out neutralisation titrations to determine the exact point of neutralisation, and explaining practical applications. | Adding the alkali too quickly near the endpoint, overshooting the neutralisation point; Not repeating the titration to get concordant results — a single result is not reliable |
| **Mastery** | Using titration results to calculate unknown concentrations, understanding the mole ratios involved, and evaluating the choice of indicator. | Making unit errors in the concentration calculation — volume must be converted from cm³ to dm³; Thinking universal indicator is suitable for titrations — its gradual colour change makes precise endpoint detection impossible |

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** Chemistry at KS4 is rich in patterns — periodic table trends, reactivity series, reaction type categories — that allow pupils to predict the behaviour of unfamiliar substances.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- Can you describe this pattern precisely enough for someone else to continue it?
- Does this pattern hold for all cases, or only some?
- How could you test whether this is a real pattern or a coincidence?
- Can you express this pattern as a rule or formula?

**Secondary lens:** Cause and Effect — Chemical reactions involve causal mechanisms (electron transfer causes bonding, acid-base reactions follow proton transfer) that explain observed phenomena rather than merely describing them.

## Session structure: Fair Test

### Fair Test
The classic scientific enquiry: formulating a testable question, making a prediction based on scientific understanding, designing a method that controls variables, collecting and recording data systematically, analysing results, and drawing a conclusion linked back to the original hypothesis.

`question` → `hypothesis` → `method` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `conclusion`

**Assessment:** Structured scientific report including question, hypothesis with reasoning, method with variables identified, results table/graph, and conclusion evaluating whether results support the hypothesis.

**Teacher note:** Use the FAIR TEST template: frame a hypothesis in terms of independent, dependent, and control variables. Expect pupils to plan a method that controls variables and selects appropriate equipment for accurate measurement. Guide them to collect repeat measurements, calculate means, and present data graphically. Prompt evaluation of the method including sources of error and reliability of results.

**KS3 question stems:**
- What is your hypothesis, and what scientific reasoning supports it?
- How will you ensure your results are reliable and your test is fair?
- What do your results show, and how confident can you be in this conclusion?
- What sources of error might affect your results, and how could you reduce them?

---

## Variables

**Independent:** type of substance tested / amount of alkali added
**Dependent:** pH value / colour of indicator
**Controlled:** same volume of acid, same indicator, same concentration

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- universal indicator paper and solution
- pH meters
- dilute hydrochloric acid (1M)
- dilute sodium hydroxide (1M)
- household substances (lemon juice, soap, bicarbonate)
- test tubes
- safety goggles
- gloves

**Safety notes:** Wear safety goggles and gloves throughout. Use only dilute acids and alkalis (max 1M). Wash any splashes to skin immediately with plenty of water. Know the location of the eyewash station. Ensure good ventilation. Dispose of chemicals according to school policy — do not pour down the sink without dilution. (Hazard level: elevated)

---

## Expected outcome

Acids have pH below 7, alkalis above 7, neutral = 7. Neutralisation produces a salt and water. Universal indicator shows a colour spectrum across the pH scale. Pupils can write word equations for neutralisation reactions.

**Recording format:** pH results table, pH scale diagram, neutralisation graph (pH vs volume of alkali added)

---

## Enquiry type

### Fair Test
A controlled investigation where one variable is deliberately changed while all others are kept the same, to determine whether the changed variable has an effect on a measured outcome. The gold-standard enquiry type for causal questions in science.

**KS3 guidance:** At KS3, fair tests become more quantitative. Pupils should take repeat readings and calculate means. They should use correct scientific terminology for variables. Data presentation includes line graphs with lines of best fit. Conclusions should reference scientific models or equations. Evaluation of method reliability is expected.

**Question stems:**
- How does [independent variable] affect [dependent variable]?
- Does changing [variable] make a difference to [outcome]?
- What is the relationship between [variable A] and [variable B]?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What will you change? (independent variable)
- What will you measure or observe? (dependent variable)
- What will you keep the same? (controlled variables)
- What do you predict will happen? Why?
- Was your prediction correct? What does the evidence show?

## Known misconceptions

### All acids are dangerous
**What pupils may say:** All acids are dangerous and will burn you.
**Correct explanation:** Many acids are weak and found in everyday foods. Citric acid is in lemons and oranges. Ethanoic acid (acetic acid) is in vinegar. Carbonic acid is in fizzy drinks. These are safe to consume. Only strong, concentrated acids (like concentrated hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid) are corrosive and dangerous. The pH value and concentration determine how hazardous an acid is.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- Is lemon juice an acid? Is it dangerous?
- What is the difference between a strong acid and a weak acid?
- Give an example of an acid that you eat or drink every day.

### Neutral means safe
**What pupils may say:** Neutral (pH 7) means safe — anything that is neutral cannot harm you.
**Correct explanation:** Neutral means pH 7, which is neither acidic nor alkaline. However, a substance can be neutral and still harmful for other reasons — for example, heavy metal solutions can be approximately neutral but extremely toxic. Conversely, many acidic substances (lemon juice, pH ~2) are perfectly safe. Safety depends on many factors beyond pH alone.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- Is pure water safe? It is neutral at pH 7.
- Could a neutral substance still be harmful? Give an example.
- Does pH tell you everything you need to know about whether a substance is safe?

## Why this study matters

Fair testing with acids and alkalis provides a rich context for developing practical chemistry skills — safe handling of hazardous substances, accurate measurement using indicators and pH meters, and systematic recording. The neutralisation investigation introduces quantitative chemistry (measuring volumes) while the pH scale provides a concrete number line that pupils can relate to everyday substances.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils think 'neutral' means 'safe' — neutral substances are pH 7, but concentrated neutral solutions can still be harmful
2. Confusing strong/weak acids with concentrated/dilute acids — these are different concepts (strong = fully dissociates, concentrated = lots of solute)
3. Pupils may think all acids are dangerous — many everyday substances are mildly acidic (orange juice, vinegar)

## Sensitive content

- Emphasise safe handling of acids and alkalis — always wear goggles and gloves
- Ensure pupils know the location of eyewash stations before starting the practical

## Working scientifically skills (KS3)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Asking questions** — Posing simple questions about observations and recognising that different types of question require different approaches to find an answer, including tests, observations over time, and looking in books.
- **Observing closely** — Using the senses and simple equipment such as magnifying glasses to make careful first-hand observations of objects, organisms and phenomena.
- **Performing simple tests** — Carrying out simple practical investigations to explore questions, with early awareness that some things should be kept the same while one thing is changed.
- **Identifying and classifying** — Sorting and grouping objects, organisms or materials according to their observable characteristics, recognising that things can be classified in more than one way depending on which features are selected.
- **Using observations to suggest answers** — Making connections between what has been observed and possible answers to questions, explaining reasoning in accessible language and recognising when observations support or challenge initial ideas.
- **Gathering and recording data** — Collecting information from observations or tests and presenting it in simple forms including drawings, labelled diagrams, tables and pictograms to support answering a scientific question.
