## Enquiry questions

1. How are organisms in an ecosystem connected, and what happens when the environment changes?

---

## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **3 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Ecosystem interdependence (SC-KS3-C057)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Understanding how organisms depend on each other in ecosystems

**Teaching guidance:** Use the example of a woodland or pond ecosystem to illustrate interdependence. Identify producers, primary consumers, secondary consumers, and decomposers. Discuss how organisms depend on each other: plants provide food and shelter for animals, animals pollinate plants and disperse seeds, decomposers recycle nutrients back to the soil. Use the 'Jenga tower' analogy — removing one species can destabilise the whole ecosystem. Investigate a local habitat to identify interdependent relationships.

**Key vocabulary:** ecosystem, interdependence, community, population, habitat, producer, consumer, decomposer, food chain, food web, predator, prey, symbiosis, mutualism, parasitism, competition

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think food chains are linear and isolated — in reality, organisms are part of complex food webs with multiple connections. Students may also think that removing one species only affects the species directly connected to it — the effects cascade through the entire ecosystem.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knowing that living things in an environment depend on each other for food, shelter, or other needs. | Give an example of two organisms that depend on each other in a woodland. | Giving an example of a predator eating prey without explaining the mutual dependence; Thinking organisms only depend on organisms they directly eat |
| **Developing** | Using ecological vocabulary to describe interdependence, including producers, consumers, and decomposers, and explaining how changes to one species affect others. | In a pond ecosystem, the population of frogs decreases due to disease. Explain how this could affect other organisms in the ecosystem. | Only describing the effect on the organism directly above or below in the food chain, without recognising cascading effects; Forgetting to consider the effect on decomposers and the recycling of nutrients |
| **Secure** | Explaining interdependence through multiple types of ecological relationships including competition, predation, mutualism, and parasitism. | Describe three different types of ecological relationship that contribute to interdependence in a woodland ecosystem. | Confusing mutualism (both organisms benefit) with parasitism (one benefits, the other is harmed); Listing relationships without explaining how they create interdependence or what would happen if the relationship were disrupted |
| **Mastery** | Analysing the concept of keystone species and trophic cascades, and evaluating how human disruption of interdependence leads to ecosystem collapse. | When wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park in 1995 after 70 years of absence, the entire ecosystem changed — even the rivers shifted course. Explain how one species could have such far-reaching effects. | Describing only the direct predator-prey relationship (wolves eat elk) without explaining the cascading effects on vegetation, river morphology, and other species; Not distinguishing between the direct effect (reducing elk numbers) and the behavioural effect (changing where elk graze) |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Bees depend on flowers for nectar (food), and flowers depend on bees for pollination (so they can reproduce). Without bees, many flowers would not be pollinated and could not produce seeds. Without flowers, bees would have no food. They depend on each other.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Frogs are consumers that eat insects (including mosquitoes and flies). If the frog population decreases, the insect population would likely increase because fewer are being eaten. This could affect plants that insects feed on or pollinate. Frogs are also prey for organisms like herons and grass snakes — these predators would have less food and their populations might decrease. Fewer dead frogs would mean less food for decomposers. The effects cascade through the ecosystem because organisms are interconnected in food webs, not isolated food chains.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *1. Predation: owls hunt mice — this controls the mouse population and prevents overgrazing of seeds and seedlings. If owls were removed, mouse numbers would increase, damaging plant populations. 2. Mutualism: mycorrhizal fungi grow on tree roots — the fungi help the tree absorb water and mineral ions from the soil, and the tree provides the fungi with sugars from photosynthesis. Both benefit. 3. Competition: oak trees and beech trees compete for light, water, and soil nutrients. The dominant species affects which other plants can grow in the understorey. All three relationships create interdependence — removing or changing any one species has knock-on effects throughout the community because organisms are linked by multiple types of interaction, not just feeding.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Wolves are a keystone species — their influence on the ecosystem is disproportionately large relative to their numbers. This is an example of a trophic cascade, where changes at the top of the food web cascade downward. Without wolves, elk populations grew unchecked and overgrazed vegetation, especially along riverbanks. Reintroducing wolves reduced elk numbers and, crucially, changed elk behaviour — elk avoided grazing in valleys and near rivers where they were vulnerable to wolf predation. This 'ecology of fear' allowed riverside vegetation (willows, aspens) to regenerate. Regrown vegetation stabilised riverbanks (reducing erosion, literally changing river courses), provided habitat for songbirds and beavers, created shade that cooled water (benefiting fish), and supported insect populations. Beaver dams created new ponds, further diversifying habitats. The cascade continued: more berries for bears, more carrion for scavengers, more insects for birds. This demonstrates that ecosystems are not just collections of species — they are networks of interdependent relationships. Removing a keystone species unravels the network from the top down.*

### Secondary concept: Food webs (SC-KS3-C058)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Understanding food web relationships in ecosystems

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knowing that food webs show how different organisms in an ecosystem are connected by what they eat. | Only identifying the organism directly above the rabbit in the food web without considering wider effects; Thinking the arrows in a food web show 'who eats who' rather than the direction of energy transfer |
| **Developing** | Constructing and interpreting food webs using correct terminology including trophic levels, and understanding that food webs are interconnected food chains. | Drawing arrows in the wrong direction — arrows should point from prey to predator, showing energy flow; Assigning a single fixed trophic level to omnivores like the hawk, when it feeds at multiple levels |
| **Secure** | Predicting and explaining the effects of population changes in food webs, including indirect effects and time delays. | Predicting only the immediate effect on the next trophic level without following the cascade further; Not considering time delays — population changes do not happen instantly |
| **Mastery** | Evaluating the limitations of food web models, including energy transfer efficiency between trophic levels and the implications for global food security. | Stating the 10% rule without explaining where the other 90% goes (respiration, heat, waste); Drawing overly simplistic conclusions about diet without considering the limitations of the food web model |

### Secondary concept: Pollination and food security (SC-KS3-C059)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Understanding the importance of insect pollination for human food production

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knowing that insects like bees visit flowers and help plants reproduce, and that many of the foods we eat depend on this. | Thinking bees deliberately help plants, rather than understanding pollination is a side effect of bees collecting food; Not connecting pollination to the production of specific foods we eat |
| **Developing** | Explaining the process of insect pollination and understanding that a significant proportion of global food crops depend on insect pollinators. | Confusing pollination (transfer of pollen to the stigma) with fertilisation (fusion of male and female gametes); Thinking only bees are pollinators — butterflies, moths, hoverflies, beetles, and some flies are also important pollinators |
| **Secure** | Evaluating the threats to pollinators and their consequences for agriculture, distinguishing between insect-pollinated and wind-pollinated crops. | Thinking all crops would be equally affected by pollinator decline — wind-pollinated staples like wheat and rice would not be directly affected; Listing threats without explaining the mechanism by which each one harms pollinators |
| **Mastery** | Analysing the ecological and economic complexities of pollinator conservation, including the limitations of technological alternatives and the co-evolutionary relationships between plants and pollinators. | Assuming technology can straightforwardly replace natural pollination without considering scale, cost, and co-evolutionary specificity; Not considering the broader ecosystem services provided by pollinators beyond food crop pollination |

### Secondary concept: Environmental interactions (SC-KS3-C060)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Understanding how organisms affect and are affected by their environment

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knowing that living things affect their environment and that the environment affects living things. | Only describing one direction — how the environment affects organisms — without recognising that organisms also change their environment; Giving an example of a human changing the environment without considering non-human organisms |
| **Developing** | Distinguishing between biotic and abiotic factors and explaining how organisms both respond to and modify their environment. | Confusing biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) factors; Not recognising that organisms actively modify their environment rather than just passively responding to it |
| **Secure** | Analysing how human activities affect ecosystems through multiple environmental interactions, and evaluating conservation strategies. | Describing only local effects (habitat loss) without explaining global impacts (carbon release, climate change); Not connecting deforestation to the water cycle (reduced transpiration means reduced rainfall) |
| **Mastery** | Evaluating the complexity of environmental interactions, including feedback loops, invasive species dynamics, and the challenges of ecological restoration. | Not explaining why the lack of co-evolved natural enemies gives invasive species a competitive advantage; Suggesting simple removal without recognising the need to restore the full web of ecological interactions |

## Thinking lens: Systems and System Models (primary)

**Key question:** What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?

**Why this lens fits:** Food chains, food webs and ecosystems are system models: pupils map components (producers, consumers, decomposers), trace energy flows, and predict what happens when one part changes.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- What feedback loops exist in this system?
- Does this model capture all the important interactions, or does it oversimplify?
- What emergent property arises from these components interacting?
- How would removing or adding a component change the system's behaviour?

**Secondary lens:** Cause and Effect — Fair testing and investigations are designed to isolate variables and establish causal relationships — the cognitive demand is reasoning from controlled evidence to causal claims.

## Session structure: Observation Over Time

### Observation Over Time
Systematic observation and recording of changes or patterns over an extended period. Pupils make careful observations, record findings using drawings, measurements, or logs, classify what they observe, and identify patterns or trends. Particularly suited to biological processes and artistic study of the natural world.

`observation` → `recording` → `classifying` → `pattern_identification`

**Assessment:** Observation log or journal with dated entries, annotated drawings or measurements, classification of observations, and summary identifying the key patterns or changes observed.

**Teacher note:** Use the OBSERVATION OVER TIME template: design a structured observation protocol with defined variables, time intervals, and recording methods. Expect pupils to record quantitative and qualitative data systematically. Guide them to identify trends and anomalies, classify observations using scientific criteria, and relate observed patterns to underlying scientific processes.

**KS3 question stems:**
- What variables will you record, and at what intervals?
- What trends or anomalies can you identify in your data?
- How would you classify the changes you have observed?
- What underlying process explains the pattern you have identified?

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- quadrats
- identification keys
- tally counters
- tape measures
- light meters
- soil thermometers

**Safety notes:** Outdoor fieldwork risk assessment required before the visit. Check for pupil allergies (pollen, stings, plant sensitivities). Wash hands thoroughly after handling soil and organisms. Stay in designated areas. Appropriate footwear required. First aid kit must be available on site. (Hazard level: standard)

---

## Expected outcome

Organisms in an ecosystem are interdependent. Food webs show complex feeding relationships. Environmental changes (e.g. removing a species, pollution, habitat loss) have cascading knock-on effects through the ecosystem. Quadrat sampling provides data on species distribution.

**Recording format:** species tally table, bar chart of distribution, food web diagram, impact analysis

---

## Enquiry type

### Observation Over Time
A systematic enquiry where changes are observed and recorded at intervals over a period of time — hours, days, weeks, or longer. Used when the process being studied is too slow for a single lesson or when the pattern only emerges through repeated observation. Develops patience, systematic recording, and the ability to identify trends.

**KS3 guidance:** At KS3, observations over time become more precise and quantitative. Pupils should use data loggers where appropriate, take repeat measurements, and present results as line graphs with correct axes and units. They should evaluate the reliability of their observation method and suggest improvements. Explanations should reference relevant scientific models.

**Question stems:**
- How does [thing being observed] change over time?
- What happens to [variable] over [time period]?
- What pattern can you see in how [process] changes?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What do you think will happen over time? Why?
- How often should we observe and record?
- What exactly will we look for or measure each time?
- What pattern can you see in the observations?
- Can you explain why this pattern happens?

### Pattern Seeking
An enquiry where pupils look for relationships or correlations between variables in situations where it is not possible or appropriate to control all the variables. Data is collected and analysed to determine whether there is a pattern — 'Is there a link between X and Y?' — without necessarily establishing causation.

**KS3 guidance:** At KS3, pattern seeking becomes more quantitative. Pupils should use scatter graphs to identify correlations, calculate means, and evaluate whether patterns are strong or weak. They should distinguish between correlation and causation. Explanations should reference scientific models and evaluate the strength of evidence.

**Question stems:**
- Is there a pattern between [variable A] and [variable B]?
- Do [things with property X] also tend to [show property Y]?
- Can you put these in order of [property] and see what pattern emerges?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- Is there a pattern between [variable A] and [variable B]?
- What do you notice when you compare [these examples]?
- Can you put these in order? What pattern emerges?
- Why might this pattern exist?
- Does the pattern always hold, or are there exceptions?

### Identifying and Classifying
An enquiry where pupils observe, identify, and sort objects, organisms, or materials into groups based on their observable characteristics. Develops careful observation, the ability to select relevant criteria for grouping, and understanding of why classification systems are useful in science.

**KS3 guidance:** At KS3, classification becomes more formal. Pupils should use biological classification systems (Carl Linnaeus), chemical classification (elements, compounds, mixtures), and physical groupings. They should understand hierarchical classification and use dichotomous keys. Criteria should relate to underlying scientific principles, not just surface features.

**Question stems:**
- How can we sort these [items] into groups?
- What properties can we use to classify [these things]?
- Can you make a key to identify [these specimens]?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What can you observe about these [objects/organisms/materials]?
- What properties could you use to sort them?
- How have you decided which group each one belongs to?
- Could you sort them a different way? What would change?
- Can you make a key that someone else could use to identify them?

## Known misconceptions

### Decomposers are unimportant
**What pupils may say:** Decomposers are not important in an ecosystem — they just eat dead things.
**Correct explanation:** Decomposers (bacteria and fungi) are essential for recycling nutrients. When organisms die, decomposers break down the dead material and release minerals back into the soil. Plants absorb these minerals and use them to grow. Without decomposers, nutrients would be locked up in dead organisms and the soil would become depleted, eventually preventing plant growth and collapsing the entire food web.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- What would happen if all the decomposers in an ecosystem died?
- How do nutrients get from dead organisms back to living plants?
- Why are decomposers sometimes called 'nature's recyclers'?

### Energy is recycled in ecosystems
**What pupils may say:** Energy is recycled in an ecosystem just like materials are.
**Correct explanation:** Energy flows through an ecosystem in one direction and is not recycled. At each trophic level, energy is lost as heat through respiration. This is why food chains rarely have more than four or five levels — there is not enough energy left to support another level. Materials (nutrients like carbon and nitrogen) ARE recycled through biogeochemical cycles. Energy flows; materials cycle.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- What happens to the energy at each level of a food chain?
- Why are there usually only 4-5 levels in a food chain?
- What is the difference between how energy and materials move through an ecosystem?

### Removing one species only affects its predator
**What pupils may say:** Removing one species from a food web only affects the animal that eats it.
**Correct explanation:** Removing a species from a food web has cascading effects throughout the ecosystem due to interdependence. If a prey species is removed, its predators lose a food source (they may decline or switch prey). The organisms the prey species ate may increase in number. These changes ripple through the entire web. This is why biodiversity matters — the more connections in a food web, the more resilient it is.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- If all the rabbits in a meadow ecosystem died, which other organisms would be affected? Only foxes?
- What would happen to the grass if the rabbits disappeared?
- Why does removing one species affect organisms that are not directly connected to it?

## Why this study matters

Fieldwork using quadrat sampling develops essential scientific skills that cannot be replicated in a classroom: designing sampling strategies, dealing with real-world variability, and using ecological data to build food webs. The outdoor context motivates engagement while the data analysis challenges pupils to think statistically about distribution and interdependence.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils place quadrats only in 'interesting' areas rather than using random or systematic sampling — teach randomisation methods
2. Confusing a food chain with a food web — food webs show multiple interconnected feeding relationships, not just single linear chains
3. Pupils describe environmental change effects as isolated events rather than cascading impacts through the ecosystem

## Sensitive content

- Outdoor fieldwork requires a risk assessment — check for allergies (pollen, insect stings), ensure appropriate clothing and footwear
- Some pupils may be anxious about handling organisms — provide alternatives and model respectful treatment of living things

## Working scientifically skills (KS3)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Asking questions** — Posing simple questions about observations and recognising that different types of question require different approaches to find an answer, including tests, observations over time, and looking in books.
- **Observing closely** — Using the senses and simple equipment such as magnifying glasses to make careful first-hand observations of objects, organisms and phenomena.
- **Performing simple tests** — Carrying out simple practical investigations to explore questions, with early awareness that some things should be kept the same while one thing is changed.
- **Identifying and classifying** — Sorting and grouping objects, organisms or materials according to their observable characteristics, recognising that things can be classified in more than one way depending on which features are selected.
- **Using observations to suggest answers** — Making connections between what has been observed and possible answers to questions, explaining reasoning in accessible language and recognising when observations support or challenge initial ideas.
- **Gathering and recording data** — Collecting information from observations or tests and presenting it in simple forms including drawings, labelled diagrams, tables and pictograms to support answering a scientific question.
