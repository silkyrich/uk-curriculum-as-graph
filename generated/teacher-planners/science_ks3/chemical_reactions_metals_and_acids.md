---

## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Acid-metal reactions (SC-KS3-C086)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Knowledge that acids react with metals to produce salt and hydrogen

**Teaching guidance:** Demonstrate the reaction of dilute hydrochloric acid with magnesium ribbon: observe fizzing (hydrogen gas produced), test the gas with a burning splint (squeaky pop confirms hydrogen). Write the general equation: acid + metal → salt + hydrogen. Investigate which metals react with acid and which do not — this connects to the reactivity series (SC-KS3-C097). Discuss safety: some metal-acid reactions are very vigorous (sodium with acid) while others are slow or do not occur (copper with dilute acid). Use word equations for all reactions observed.

**Key vocabulary:** acid, metal, salt, hydrogen, reaction, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, magnesium, zinc, iron, copper, reactive, unreactive, squeaky pop test, gas, word equation

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think all metals react with acids — copper, silver, and gold do not react with dilute acids because they are below hydrogen in the reactivity series. Students may also confuse the name of the salt produced — the acid determines the salt: hydrochloric acid produces chlorides, sulfuric acid produces sulfates.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knowing that some metals fizz when placed in acid, producing a gas. | What happens when you put a piece of magnesium ribbon in dilute acid? | Not knowing that the gas produced is hydrogen; Thinking the metal disappears completely — it reacts to form a dissolved salt |
| **Developing** | Writing word and symbol equations for acid-metal reactions and testing for hydrogen gas. | Write the word equation for zinc reacting with hydrochloric acid. How would you test the gas produced? | Confusing the squeaky pop test for hydrogen with the relighting splint test for oxygen; Not knowing the general pattern: metal + acid → salt + hydrogen |
| **Secure** | Predicting whether a metal will react with an acid based on its position in the reactivity series, and explaining the reaction in terms of electron transfer. | Copper is placed in dilute hydrochloric acid. Predict what will happen and explain why. | Predicting copper will react with acid — copper, silver, and gold do not react with dilute acids; Not linking the reactivity series to electron transfer — more reactive metals lose electrons more easily |
| **Mastery** | Explaining reaction rates in acid-metal reactions, designing fair tests to investigate factors affecting rate, and connecting to industrial applications. | Magnesium reacts much more vigorously with acid than iron does. Explain why, and describe how you would investigate the effect of acid concentration on reaction rate. | Not controlling surface area of the metal — a powder reacts faster than a ribbon due to greater surface area; Explaining rate differences only in terms of reactivity without connecting to collision theory (frequency of collisions between acid particles and metal surface) |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *The magnesium fizzes vigorously. Bubbles of gas are produced and the magnesium gradually dissolves and disappears. The gas produced is hydrogen. The liquid remaining is a salt solution.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Zinc + hydrochloric acid → zinc chloride + hydrogen. Zn + 2HCl → ZnCl₂ + H₂. To test for hydrogen: collect the gas in a test tube, bring a burning splint to the mouth of the tube — hydrogen burns with a squeaky pop. The general pattern is: metal + acid → salt + hydrogen. The name of the salt depends on the acid: hydrochloric acid → chloride, sulfuric acid → sulfate.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *No reaction will occur. Copper is below hydrogen in the reactivity series, which means it is less reactive than hydrogen. For a metal to react with an acid, it must be more reactive than hydrogen — it must be able to displace hydrogen from the acid by donating electrons to H⁺ ions. Copper cannot do this because its atoms hold their electrons more tightly than hydrogen. In contrast, metals above hydrogen in the reactivity series (like magnesium, zinc, iron) will react because they can lose electrons more easily: Mg → Mg²⁺ + 2e⁻, and the electrons are transferred to H⁺ ions: 2H⁺ + 2e⁻ → H₂. This is why gold and platinum are unreactive — they are at the bottom of the reactivity series and cannot displace hydrogen from any acid (except very strong oxidising acids like aqua regia).*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Magnesium is higher in the reactivity series than iron — its atoms lose electrons more easily and more rapidly. This means the rate of electron transfer to H⁺ ions is faster, producing hydrogen gas more quickly (more vigorous fizzing). To investigate the effect of acid concentration: react identical pieces of magnesium ribbon with hydrochloric acid at different concentrations (0.5M, 1.0M, 1.5M, 2.0M). Control variables: same length/mass of magnesium, same volume of acid, same temperature, same surface area of magnesium. Measure either the volume of hydrogen gas produced over time (using a gas syringe) or the time taken for the magnesium to dissolve completely. I predict that higher acid concentration increases the reaction rate because there are more H⁺ ions per unit volume, so collisions between H⁺ ions and the metal surface are more frequent. Plotting volume of gas against time gives a curve — the initial gradient represents the initial rate. This collision theory principle is applied industrially in metal processing: pickling (cleaning metal surfaces with acid) uses optimised acid concentrations and temperatures to maximise cleaning rate while minimising metal loss.*

### Secondary concept: Predicting reactions (SC-KS3-C094)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Ability to predict reaction patterns using the Periodic Table

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knowing that elements in the same column of the periodic table react in similar ways. | Not predicting a more vigorous reaction for potassium (it is below sodium, so more reactive); Thinking elements in the same group react completely differently |
| **Developing** | Using group position to predict reaction patterns and products for unfamiliar elements. | Not adjusting the product name to reflect the different halogen (chloride not bromide); Failing to predict that chlorine reacts more vigorously because it is higher in Group 7 (more reactive) |
| **Secure** | Predicting displacement reactions between halogens based on reactivity, and using the periodic table to explain why predictions work. | Predicting a reaction when the added halogen is less reactive than the one in solution — less reactive halogens cannot displace more reactive ones; Not explaining the colour change as evidence of the displacement occurring |
| **Mastery** | Evaluating the predictive power of the periodic table for complex scenarios, understanding exceptions to trends, and applying predictions to real-world chemistry. | Stating predictions as facts without acknowledging that bulk properties of astatine have not been experimentally measured; Not considering that radioactivity and relativistic effects may cause deviations from simple periodic trends |

### Secondary concept: Reactivity series (SC-KS3-C097)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Knowledge of the order of metals and carbon in the reactivity series

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knowing that some metals are more reactive than others and that there is an order called the reactivity series. | Not connecting reactivity to everyday observations like rusting; Thinking 'more expensive' means 'more reactive' — gold is unreactive, which is partly why it is valuable |
| **Developing** | Listing the main metals in the reactivity series and understanding how it is determined from reactions with water and acids. | Putting metals in the wrong order — a common error is placing iron above magnesium; Not including carbon and hydrogen as reference points in the series |
| **Secure** | Using the reactivity series to predict displacement reactions and explain why they occur in terms of electron transfer. | Predicting a reaction when the added metal is less reactive than the metal in solution; Not linking the reactivity series to electron transfer — more reactive metals lose electrons more easily |
| **Mastery** | Applying the reactivity series to explain extraction methods, evaluating the economic and environmental implications of different extraction techniques. | Not explaining why carbon cannot reduce aluminium oxide — aluminium is more reactive than carbon; Failing to connect the extraction method to cost and environmental impact |

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** Chemistry at KS4 is rich in patterns — periodic table trends, reactivity series, reaction type categories — that allow pupils to predict the behaviour of unfamiliar substances.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- Can you describe this pattern precisely enough for someone else to continue it?
- Does this pattern hold for all cases, or only some?
- How could you test whether this is a real pattern or a coincidence?
- Can you express this pattern as a rule or formula?

**Secondary lens:** Cause and Effect — Chemical reactions involve causal mechanisms (electron transfer causes bonding, acid-base reactions follow proton transfer) that explain observed phenomena rather than merely describing them.

## Session structure: Pattern Seeking

### Pattern Seeking
Enquiry focused on identifying relationships and regularities in data. Pupils pose questions about possible correlations, gather data through observation or measurement, organise and represent data graphically, identify patterns, and attempt to explain the underlying relationship.

`question` → `data_gathering` → `graphing` → `pattern_identification` → `explanation`

**Assessment:** Data presentation with appropriate graph or chart, written description of the pattern found, and explanation of the possible reasons for the pattern, including evaluation of the strength of evidence.

**Teacher note:** Use the PATTERN SEEKING template: frame an enquiry question that requires pupils to collect and analyse data to identify correlations or trends. Expect appropriate graphical presentation and the use of mathematical language to describe relationships. Prompt pupils to distinguish between correlation and causation, and to consider the reliability of the pattern given the sample size.

**KS3 question stems:**
- What type of graph best represents this data, and why?
- Is this a correlation, a trend, or a causal relationship?
- How confident can you be in this pattern given the sample size?
- What further data would you need to confirm or refine this pattern?

## Variables

**Independent:** type of metal (magnesium, zinc, iron, copper)
**Dependent:** vigour of reaction (observations: fizzing, temperature change, gas production)
**Controlled:** same volume and concentration of acid, same size of metal piece

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- dilute hydrochloric acid (1M)
- metal samples (Mg, Zn, Fe, Cu)
- test tubes
- test tube rack
- splints
- safety goggles
- gloves
- thermometer

**Safety notes:** Wear safety goggles and gloves throughout. Magnesium reacts vigorously with acid — use small pieces only (1-2 cm ribbon). Test for hydrogen with a lighted splint held well away from the acid — do not look into the test tube. Good ventilation required as hydrogen gas is flammable. Dilute acid only (max 1M HCl). Dispose of waste according to school policy. (Hazard level: elevated)

---

## Expected outcome

Metals react with acids to produce a salt and hydrogen. More reactive metals react more vigorously (more fizzing, greater temperature change). The reactivity series ranks metals by their reactivity: Mg > Zn > Fe > Cu (copper does not react with dilute acid). Pupils can write word equations: metal + acid -> metal salt + hydrogen.

**Recording format:** observations table (metal, observations, temperature change), reactivity series ranking, word equations

## Enquiry type

### Pattern Seeking
An enquiry where pupils look for relationships or correlations between variables in situations where it is not possible or appropriate to control all the variables. Data is collected and analysed to determine whether there is a pattern — 'Is there a link between X and Y?' — without necessarily establishing causation.

**KS3 guidance:** At KS3, pattern seeking becomes more quantitative. Pupils should use scatter graphs to identify correlations, calculate means, and evaluate whether patterns are strong or weak. They should distinguish between correlation and causation. Explanations should reference scientific models and evaluate the strength of evidence.

**Question stems:**
- Is there a pattern between [variable A] and [variable B]?
- Do [things with property X] also tend to [show property Y]?
- Can you put these in order of [property] and see what pattern emerges?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- Is there a pattern between [variable A] and [variable B]?
- What do you notice when you compare [these examples]?
- Can you put these in order? What pattern emerges?
- Why might this pattern exist?
- Does the pattern always hold, or are there exceptions?

## Known misconceptions

### All metals react with acids
**What pupils may say:** All metals react with acids.
**Correct explanation:** Some metals are too unreactive to react with dilute acids. Copper, silver, gold, and platinum do not react with dilute hydrochloric acid because they are below hydrogen in the reactivity series. Only metals above hydrogen (like magnesium, zinc, and iron) react with dilute acids to produce a salt and hydrogen gas. This is why gold jewellery does not dissolve in contact with acidic substances.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- If you put a gold ring in dilute hydrochloric acid, would it dissolve? Why or why not?
- What would you observe if you put copper in dilute acid?
- What determines whether a metal will react with an acid?

### Bubbles in reactions are air
**What pupils may say:** The bubbles produced when metals react with acids are air.
**Correct explanation:** The gas produced when metals react with dilute acids is hydrogen, not air. Hydrogen is produced because the acid donates hydrogen ions (H+) which combine to form hydrogen gas (H2). The hydrogen gas can be identified by the 'squeaky pop' test — a burning splint makes a popping sound when held near the gas. Air would not give this result.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- What gas is produced when magnesium reacts with hydrochloric acid?
- How could you test what gas is being produced?
- What is the 'squeaky pop' test? What gas does it identify?

## Why this study matters

Pattern seeking is the natural enquiry type for the reactivity series because pupils observe a gradient of reactivity across different metals reacting with the same acid. The pattern — from vigorous fizzing (magnesium) to no reaction (copper) — is dramatic, memorable, and demands explanation. Building the reactivity series from first-hand evidence rather than memorising a list develops genuine scientific reasoning.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils memorise the reactivity series without understanding what it means — always link back to the practical observations
2. Difficulty writing word equations — practise the pattern: metal + acid -> metal salt + hydrogen
3. Pupils may think unreactive metals are 'bad' — discuss why gold and platinum are valued precisely because they are unreactive

## Working scientifically skills (KS3)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Asking questions** — Posing simple questions about observations and recognising that different types of question require different approaches to find an answer, including tests, observations over time, and looking in books.
- **Observing closely** — Using the senses and simple equipment such as magnifying glasses to make careful first-hand observations of objects, organisms and phenomena.
- **Performing simple tests** — Carrying out simple practical investigations to explore questions, with early awareness that some things should be kept the same while one thing is changed.
- **Identifying and classifying** — Sorting and grouping objects, organisms or materials according to their observable characteristics, recognising that things can be classified in more than one way depending on which features are selected.
- **Using observations to suggest answers** — Making connections between what has been observed and possible answers to questions, explaining reasoning in accessible language and recognising when observations support or challenge initial ideas.
- **Gathering and recording data** — Collecting information from observations or tests and presenting it in simple forms including drawings, labelled diagrams, tables and pictograms to support answering a scientific question.
