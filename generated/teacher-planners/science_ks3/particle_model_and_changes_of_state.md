## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **3 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Particle model of matter (SC-KS3-C068)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Understanding that matter is made of particles with properties explained by their arrangement and motion

**Teaching guidance:** Use animations or physical models (marbles in a tray) to demonstrate how particle arrangement and movement explain the properties of solids, liquids, and gases. Key features: particles in solids are closely packed in a regular arrangement and vibrate in fixed positions; particles in liquids are closely packed but irregularly arranged and can move past each other; particles in gases are widely spaced, move randomly and rapidly. Use the particle model to explain observable properties: solids have a fixed shape, liquids flow, gases fill their container and can be compressed.

**Key vocabulary:** particle model, solid, liquid, gas, arrangement, vibration, movement, spacing, regular, irregular, flow, compress, expand, fixed shape, fixed volume, diffusion, kinetic energy

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think particles themselves change — e.g., particles in a solid are hard, particles in a gas are soft. Clarify that the particles are the same; it is their arrangement, spacing, and movement that differ. Students may also think there is something between the particles (air or glue) — in a pure substance, there is nothing between the particles.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knowing that all matter is made of tiny particles that are too small to see, and that these particles are always moving. | If you could zoom in far enough on a glass of water, what would you see? | Thinking particles in a liquid are stationary because the liquid appears still; Believing there is something (like air or glue) between the particles in a pure substance |
| **Developing** | Using the particle model to explain properties of solids, liquids, and gases in terms of particle arrangement, spacing, and movement. | Use the particle model to explain why you can compress a gas but not a liquid. | Thinking the particles themselves get smaller when a gas is compressed rather than understanding the spaces between them decrease; Not explaining that liquids have particles close together already, which is why they cannot be compressed |
| **Secure** | Using the particle model to explain a range of physical phenomena including diffusion, dissolving, and changes of state, and linking particle energy to temperature. | If you open a bottle of perfume in one corner of a room, you can eventually smell it on the other side. Explain this using the particle model. | Saying the perfume 'floats' across the room rather than explaining diffusion through random particle motion; Not explaining why diffusion is slow despite individual particles moving quickly (billions of random collisions create a zigzag path) |
| **Mastery** | Evaluating the strengths and limitations of the particle model, understanding that it is a simplified model, and applying it to unfamiliar contexts. | The particle model shows particles as solid spheres with nothing between them. Identify two limitations of this model and explain what a more accurate picture would include. | Criticising the model without acknowledging why simplification is useful and appropriate at this level; Not identifying intermolecular forces as a key omission that limits the model's ability to explain why substances have different boiling points |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *You would see billions of tiny particles (water molecules) all moving around. The particles are far too small to see with your eyes or even a normal microscope. They are constantly moving and bumping into each other. Even though the water looks still, the particles inside it are always in motion.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *In a gas, particles are far apart with large spaces between them. They move quickly in random directions. When you compress a gas, you push the particles closer together into the empty space — the gas takes up less volume. In a liquid, particles are close together with very small spaces between them. They can slide over each other but cannot be pushed significantly closer. This is why liquids are virtually incompressible — there is very little empty space to squeeze out. In a solid, particles are even more tightly packed in a regular arrangement and can only vibrate — solids are also incompressible.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *The perfume molecules evaporate from the liquid and enter the air as gas particles. These gas particles move rapidly in random directions, colliding with air molecules and bouncing off in new directions. Over time, the random movement causes perfume particles to spread from the area of high concentration (near the bottle) to areas of low concentration (across the room) — this is diffusion. The process is relatively slow despite individual particles moving at hundreds of metres per second because each particle undergoes billions of collisions that send it in random directions, creating a zigzag path. If the room were warmer, diffusion would be faster because particles have more kinetic energy and move faster. If the room were perfectly still with no air currents, diffusion alone would take many minutes — in practice, convection currents in the air speed up the spreading process considerably.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Limitation 1: The model shows particles as solid, rigid spheres — in reality, atoms have internal structure (nucleus, electron cloud) and are mostly empty space. Electrons occupy probability clouds rather than fixed orbits, and the nucleus is approximately 100,000 times smaller than the atom itself. Treating them as solid balls works for explaining bulk properties but fails for understanding chemical bonding, spectroscopy, or nuclear reactions. Limitation 2: The model shows no forces between particles — in reality, intermolecular forces (van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonds, dipole-dipole interactions) exist between particles and are responsible for properties like boiling point, viscosity, and surface tension. Without these forces, no substance could exist as a liquid or solid. A more accurate model would show particles with internal structure, surrounded by force fields that attract at medium range and repel at very short range. However, models are deliberately simplified to be useful — the particle model at KS3 level explains diffusion, gas pressure, and state changes effectively without the complexity of quantum mechanics. All scientific models involve trade-offs between simplicity and accuracy.*

### Secondary concept: States of matter (SC-KS3-C069)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Understanding the properties of solid, liquid, and gas states in terms of particles

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knowing that matter exists in three main states — solid, liquid, and gas — and identifying everyday examples of each. | Thinking gases have no mass because they are invisible — gases have mass (air has weight); Classifying powders or sand as liquids because they can be poured — each grain is a solid |
| **Developing** | Explaining the properties of solids, liquids, and gases using the particle model, including differences in arrangement, spacing, and movement. | Drawing particles of different sizes in different states — the particles are the same; only their arrangement and spacing differ; Not showing movement in solid particle diagrams — solid particles do vibrate about fixed positions |
| **Secure** | Explaining density in terms of particle arrangement and using the particle model to explain unusual properties such as ice floating on water. | Thinking ice floats because it is a solid, without explaining the unusual open crystal structure caused by hydrogen bonding; Not recognising that water's behaviour is an exception to the general rule that solids are denser than their liquid form |
| **Mastery** | Applying the particle model to explain the behaviour of substances that do not fit neatly into the three-state model, and understanding the concept of a fourth state (plasma). | Dismissing the three-state model entirely rather than recognising it as a useful simplification with known limitations; Not knowing that plasma is a fourth state of matter and the most abundant state in the universe |

### Secondary concept: Gas pressure (SC-KS3-C070)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Understanding gas pressure in terms of particle collisions

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knowing that gas pushes on the walls of its container and that this push is called gas pressure. | Thinking the balloon pops because the air is 'too heavy' rather than because of pressure from particle collisions; Not connecting gas pressure to particles colliding with the container walls |
| **Developing** | Explaining gas pressure in terms of particle collisions with container walls and understanding how temperature and volume affect pressure. | Saying the particles 'expand' when heated rather than explaining they move faster; Not linking both the increased frequency and the increased force of collisions to the pressure increase |
| **Secure** | Explaining the relationship between pressure, volume, and temperature using the particle model, and applying this to real-world situations. | Not explaining that the volume change is due to the change in external pressure acting on the same number of gas particles; Forgetting that Boyle's Law only applies at constant temperature |
| **Mastery** | Applying the particle model of gas pressure to explain atmospheric pressure, vacuum systems, and engineering applications, and understanding the quantitative relationship between pressure, volume, and temperature. | Saying there is 'no air' at high altitude rather than explaining there is less air (lower density, fewer particles, therefore lower pressure); Not connecting the gas pressure concept to the biological need for adequate partial pressure of oxygen for diffusion in the lungs |

### Secondary concept: Changes of state (SC-KS3-C071)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Understanding phase changes in terms of the particle model

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knowing that matter can change between solid, liquid, and gas states by heating or cooling, and naming these changes. | Confusing evaporation with boiling — evaporation happens at the surface at any temperature; boiling happens throughout the liquid at a specific temperature; Not knowing the names of all the changes of state (melting, freezing, boiling, condensation, evaporation) |
| **Developing** | Explaining changes of state using the particle model and understanding that energy is needed to overcome forces between particles. | Thinking the particles themselves change or get bigger when heated; Not mentioning that energy is needed to overcome the forces of attraction between particles |
| **Secure** | Interpreting heating curves, explaining why temperature remains constant during a change of state, and understanding the energy changes involved. | Not explaining that energy during a change of state goes into breaking intermolecular forces rather than increasing kinetic energy (temperature); Thinking temperature remains constant because no energy is being supplied, when in fact energy is being supplied but used differently |
| **Mastery** | Explaining sublimation and deposition, comparing latent heat values for different substances, and evaluating how intermolecular forces determine melting and boiling points. | Thinking sublimation is an unusual phenomenon rather than understanding it is determined by the substance's phase diagram and external pressure; Not connecting the strength of intermolecular forces to the melting and boiling points of different substances |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Material properties link physical structure (molecular arrangement, surface texture) to functional behaviour (waterproofing, strength, flexibility) — the key question is always 'why does this material behave this way?'

**Question stems for KS3:**
- How does the structure at this scale enable the function we observe?
- What trade-offs were involved in this structural design?
- How is this structure adapted to solve a specific problem?
- What would you predict about an organism's function from its structure alone?

**Secondary lens:** Patterns — Properties can be sorted and classified into patterns (metals conduct, insulators don't), allowing pupils to make predictions about unfamiliar materials.

## Session structure: Observation Over Time

### Observation Over Time
Systematic observation and recording of changes or patterns over an extended period. Pupils make careful observations, record findings using drawings, measurements, or logs, classify what they observe, and identify patterns or trends. Particularly suited to biological processes and artistic study of the natural world.

`observation` → `recording` → `classifying` → `pattern_identification`

**Assessment:** Observation log or journal with dated entries, annotated drawings or measurements, classification of observations, and summary identifying the key patterns or changes observed.

**Teacher note:** Use the OBSERVATION OVER TIME template: design a structured observation protocol with defined variables, time intervals, and recording methods. Expect pupils to record quantitative and qualitative data systematically. Guide them to identify trends and anomalies, classify observations using scientific criteria, and relate observed patterns to underlying scientific processes.

**KS3 question stems:**
- What variables will you record, and at what intervals?
- What trends or anomalies can you identify in your data?
- How would you classify the changes you have observed?
- What underlying process explains the pattern you have identified?

---

## Variables

**Independent:** time (continuous heating or cooling)
**Dependent:** temperature
**Controlled:** same substance, same volume, same heating rate

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- thermometers
- beakers
- ice
- Bunsen burner or water bath
- stearic acid (for cooling curve)
- stopwatch
- heatproof mat

**Safety notes:** Use water baths rather than direct heating where possible. Stearic acid is hot when melted — use tongs to handle containers. Wear safety goggles throughout. Tie back long hair near Bunsen burners. Ensure heatproof mats are in place. Do not touch hot beakers — use tongs or allow to cool. (Hazard level: elevated)

---

## Expected outcome

Temperature stays constant during changes of state (melting, boiling). Particles in solids vibrate in fixed positions; in liquids they move freely but stay close; in gases they move rapidly in all directions. Energy is needed to change state — it breaks bonds between particles rather than raising temperature.

**Recording format:** temperature-time data table, heating/cooling curve graph, particle diagrams for each state

---

## Enquiry type

### Observation Over Time
A systematic enquiry where changes are observed and recorded at intervals over a period of time — hours, days, weeks, or longer. Used when the process being studied is too slow for a single lesson or when the pattern only emerges through repeated observation. Develops patience, systematic recording, and the ability to identify trends.

**KS3 guidance:** At KS3, observations over time become more precise and quantitative. Pupils should use data loggers where appropriate, take repeat measurements, and present results as line graphs with correct axes and units. They should evaluate the reliability of their observation method and suggest improvements. Explanations should reference relevant scientific models.

**Question stems:**
- How does [thing being observed] change over time?
- What happens to [variable] over [time period]?
- What pattern can you see in how [process] changes?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What do you think will happen over time? Why?
- How often should we observe and record?
- What exactly will we look for or measure each time?
- What pattern can you see in the observations?
- Can you explain why this pattern happens?

### Modelling
An enquiry where pupils build, use, and evaluate models to understand phenomena that cannot be directly observed or tested. Models can be physical (e.g. particle model using marbles), diagrammatic (e.g. ray diagrams), mathematical (e.g. equations), or computational. The key pedagogical move is testing the model's predictions against reality and refining it.

**KS3 guidance:** At KS3, modelling becomes more abstract and powerful. The particle model, cell model, and wave model are central. Pupils should use models to make quantitative predictions (e.g. using the particle model to predict what happens during heating). They should critically evaluate model limitations (e.g. particles drawn as circles do not show that real particles are not spherical). Mathematical models (e.g. speed = distance / time) are introduced.

**Question stems:**
- How can we model [phenomenon] to understand it better?
- What does our model predict will happen?
- Where does our model break down? How could we improve it?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What are we trying to explain or understand?
- How can we build a model to represent this?
- If our model is correct, what should happen when...?
- Does the evidence match our model's prediction?
- What does our model get right? What does it get wrong? How can we improve it?

## Known misconceptions

### Particles expand when heated
**What pupils may say:** Particles get bigger when they are heated.
**Correct explanation:** Particles do not change size when heated. What happens is that they gain kinetic energy and move faster. In a solid, they vibrate more; in a liquid, they move more freely; in a gas, they move faster and spread further apart. The substance expands because the particles move further apart, not because the particles themselves grow.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- When you heat a solid, do the particles get bigger or do they move more?
- If particles got bigger when heated, what would happen to the mass of the substance?
- Draw what you think happens to particles in a solid when it is heated.

### No particles in gas
**What pupils may say:** There are no particles in a gas because you cannot see it.
**Correct explanation:** Gases are made of particles just like solids and liquids. The particles in a gas are much more spread out and move randomly at high speed, which is why gases are invisible, fill their container, and can be compressed. The fact that we cannot see the particles does not mean they are not there — we cannot see the particles in a solid or liquid either, they are just closer together.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- If there are no particles in air, what do we breathe?
- Can you feel wind? What is wind made of?
- Why can you smell perfume from across the room? What is travelling to your nose?

### Heating always raises temperature
**What pupils may say:** Temperature always increases when you heat something.
**Correct explanation:** During a change of state (melting or boiling), the temperature remains constant even though energy is being added. The energy is being used to break the bonds between particles (changing their arrangement) rather than increasing their kinetic energy (which would raise the temperature). This is why a heating curve has flat sections at the melting point and boiling point.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- What happens to the temperature of ice when it is melting? Does it keep going up?
- If you keep heating water at 100C, what happens to the temperature? What happens to the water?
- Where is the energy going during a change of state if the temperature is not increasing?

## Why this study matters

The heating/cooling curve is pedagogically powerful because it reveals a counter-intuitive result: temperature stays constant during a change of state. This drives deeper questioning about what is happening at the particle level. The combination of observation over time (plotting the curve) and modelling (explaining it with particles) makes this a rich, dual-enquiry-type investigation.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils draw particles in a gas as being larger than in a solid — the particles are the same size, only their spacing and arrangement change
2. Difficulty explaining why temperature stays constant during a change of state — energy is being used to break bonds between particles, not to increase kinetic energy
3. Pupils may think heating always makes things hotter — during a state change, added energy changes the arrangement of particles rather than raising temperature

## Working scientifically skills (KS3)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Asking questions** — Posing simple questions about observations and recognising that different types of question require different approaches to find an answer, including tests, observations over time, and looking in books.
- **Observing closely** — Using the senses and simple equipment such as magnifying glasses to make careful first-hand observations of objects, organisms and phenomena.
- **Performing simple tests** — Carrying out simple practical investigations to explore questions, with early awareness that some things should be kept the same while one thing is changed.
- **Identifying and classifying** — Sorting and grouping objects, organisms or materials according to their observable characteristics, recognising that things can be classified in more than one way depending on which features are selected.
- **Using observations to suggest answers** — Making connections between what has been observed and possible answers to questions, explaining reasoning in accessible language and recognising when observations support or challenge initial ideas.
- **Gathering and recording data** — Collecting information from observations or tests and presenting it in simple forms including drawings, labelled diagrams, tables and pictograms to support answering a scientific question.
