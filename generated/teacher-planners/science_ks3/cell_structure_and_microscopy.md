## Enquiry questions

1. What are cells made of, and how do plant and animal cells differ?

---

## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **3 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Cell structure (SC-KS3-C026)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Knowledge that cells are the fundamental unit of living organisms with specific structures

**Teaching guidance:** Begin with the concept that all living things are made of cells, then introduce plant and animal cell diagrams with labels. Use prepared slides under light microscopes to observe real cells — onion epidermal cells and cheek cells are excellent starting points. Compare microscope images with textbook diagrams to help pupils understand that real cells are less regular than illustrations. Use 3D models or animations to reinforce understanding of cell structure.

**Key vocabulary:** cell, nucleus, cytoplasm, cell membrane, cell wall, vacuole, chloroplast, mitochondria, organelle, plant cell, animal cell, prokaryote, eukaryote, unicellular, multicellular

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think cells are flat, 2D structures because they see flat diagrams — use 3D models to show cells are three-dimensional. Students may believe all cells look the same — show images of diverse cell types. Students sometimes think the cell membrane and cell wall are the same — clarify that the membrane controls what enters and leaves, while the cell wall provides structural support.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that living things are made of cells but has a limited understanding of cell structure beyond the basic idea. | What is a cell? | Thinking cells are flat, two-dimensional structures because textbook diagrams show them that way; Confusing cells with atoms — cells are biological units of life, atoms are chemical units of matter |
| **Developing** | Labels the main parts of plant and animal cells from a diagram and states the basic function of each part. | Label this diagram of an animal cell and state the function of the nucleus, cell membrane, and mitochondria. | Calling the cell membrane the 'cell wall' — animal cells do not have cell walls; Thinking the nucleus is the 'brain' that actively directs the cell moment by moment |
| **Secure** | Compares plant, animal, and bacterial cells in detail, explains how organelle structure relates to function, and uses a microscope to observe and draw cells accurately. | Explain why plant cells have chloroplasts but animal cells do not. Include the function of chloroplasts and what this means for how plants and animals obtain energy. | Thinking plant cells do not have mitochondria because they have chloroplasts; Believing all plant cells have chloroplasts — root cells do not, because they are underground and receive no light |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates the limitations of cell models, explains how cell structure is adapted for specialised functions, and connects subcellular structure to whole-organism physiology. | A red blood cell has no nucleus or mitochondria. Explain how its structure is adapted for its function of transporting oxygen, and evaluate whether it is still truly a 'cell'. | Not connecting the absence of a nucleus to the benefit of increased haemoglobin capacity; Not recognising that the biconcave shape is an adaptation for increased surface area |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *A cell is a tiny building block that makes up all living things.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Nucleus: contains DNA and controls the cell's activities. Cell membrane: controls what enters and leaves the cell. Mitochondria: the site of aerobic respiration where energy is released from glucose.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Plant cells have chloroplasts because plants are autotrophs — they make their own food through photosynthesis. Chloroplasts contain chlorophyll, which absorbs light energy and uses it to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose. Animal cells do not need chloroplasts because animals are heterotrophs — they obtain energy by eating other organisms. Both plant and animal cells have mitochondria because both need to carry out respiration to release energy from glucose. The difference is where the glucose comes from: plants make it (photosynthesis), animals eat it.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Red blood cells are highly specialised for oxygen transport. Having no nucleus creates more internal space for haemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein — maximising the amount of oxygen each cell can carry. The biconcave disc shape increases the surface area to volume ratio, allowing faster diffusion of oxygen in and out. Having no mitochondria means the red blood cell does not use any of the oxygen it carries for its own respiration (it respires anaerobically), so all the oxygen reaches the tissues. Whether it is truly a 'cell' is debatable — it lacks a nucleus (so cannot divide or repair itself), has no mitochondria, and has a limited lifespan (~120 days). By some definitions it is not a complete cell, but rather a highly modified cell fragment optimised for a single function. This illustrates that the standard cell model taught in textbooks is a generalisation — real cells show enormous diversity in structure depending on their function.*

### Secondary concept: Light microscopy (SC-KS3-C027)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Skill in using a light microscope to observe and record cell structure

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that a microscope makes things look bigger but cannot use one independently or explain how it works. | Thinking the microscope makes the object physically larger; Not knowing the difference between magnification and resolution |
| **Developing** | Uses a light microscope with support to observe prepared slides, focuses using low and medium power, and draws basic scientific diagrams of cells. | Starting with high magnification rather than low, making it difficult to find the specimen; Trying to use the coarse focus on high magnification, which risks crashing the lens into the slide |
| **Secure** | Prepares slides independently, stains specimens appropriately, observes at all magnifications, calculates magnification, and produces accurate scientific drawings with scale bars. | Creating air bubbles by dropping the cover slip straight down instead of lowering it at an angle; Shading or colouring the drawing — scientific drawings use only clear line diagrams |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates the limitations of light microscopy compared to electron microscopy, calculates actual cell sizes from microscope images, and adapts staining techniques for different specimens. | Confusing magnification with resolution — higher magnification without better resolution does not reveal smaller structures; Not converting between units correctly (mm to μm to nm) |

### Secondary concept: Cell organelle functions (SC-KS3-C028)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Knowledge of the functions of cell wall, membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, vacuole, mitochondria, and chloroplasts

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Names some organelles in a cell but has difficulty explaining what each one does. | Giving vague answers without mentioning DNA or genetic information; Thinking the nucleus actively 'tells' other parts of the cell what to do in real time |
| **Developing** | States the function of the main organelles (nucleus, mitochondria, cell membrane, cytoplasm, chloroplasts, vacuole, ribosomes) and identifies which are found in plant versus animal cells. | Saying mitochondria 'make energy' rather than 'release energy from glucose through respiration'; Confusing ribosomes (protein synthesis) with mitochondria (respiration) |
| **Secure** | Explains how the structure of each organelle relates to its function and connects organelle function to whole-cell processes. | Not linking the folded inner membrane to increased surface area for respiration; Saying mitochondria 'produce energy' rather than 'release energy through respiration' |
| **Mastery** | Explains how organelles work together as an integrated system, applies the concept that structure determines function to unfamiliar cell types, and evaluates the endosymbiotic theory of mitochondrial and chloroplast origin. | Citing only one piece of evidence when multiple independent lines of evidence converge; Not explaining why the double membrane supports the engulfment hypothesis |

### Secondary concept: Plant vs animal cells (SC-KS3-C029)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Understanding the similarities and differences between plant and animal cell structures

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that plant cells and animal cells are different but can only name one or two differences. | Thinking plant cells have a cell wall instead of a cell membrane — they have both; Not knowing that both cell types have a nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria |
| **Developing** | Lists the key similarities and differences between plant and animal cells, identifying which organelles are unique to each. | Saying animal cells have no vacuoles at all — they have small, temporary ones; Thinking plant cells do not have mitochondria |
| **Secure** | Explains why plant cells have structures that animal cells lack, linking each structural difference to the different lifestyles of plants and animals. | Not explaining turgor pressure and its role in keeping plants upright; Thinking the cell wall is for protection rather than structural support |
| **Mastery** | Extends the comparison to bacterial cells, evaluates how cell structure reflects evolutionary history, and explains exceptions to the general rules. | Describing bacteria as 'simple' without recognising their evolutionary success and biochemical complexity; Confusing the bacterial cell wall (peptidoglycan) with the plant cell wall (cellulose) |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Scientific observations and enquiry serve to establish causal relationships; framing questions around 'what causes X' gives purpose to the observation work.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- Does this show a cause, or just a correlation?
- What is the mechanism — how exactly does A lead to B?
- Which factor had the biggest effect, and how could you tell?
- What evidence would you need to prove this was the cause?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — This cluster asks pupils to gather, record or communicate scientific findings — the core cognitive demand is evaluating what counts as valid evidence and how to present it clearly.

---

## Session structure: Observation Over Time

### Observation Over Time
Systematic observation and recording of changes or patterns over an extended period. Pupils make careful observations, record findings using drawings, measurements, or logs, classify what they observe, and identify patterns or trends. Particularly suited to biological processes and artistic study of the natural world.

`observation` → `recording` → `classifying` → `pattern_identification`

**Assessment:** Observation log or journal with dated entries, annotated drawings or measurements, classification of observations, and summary identifying the key patterns or changes observed.

**Teacher note:** Use the OBSERVATION OVER TIME template: design a structured observation protocol with defined variables, time intervals, and recording methods. Expect pupils to record quantitative and qualitative data systematically. Guide them to identify trends and anomalies, classify observations using scientific criteria, and relate observed patterns to underlying scientific processes.

**KS3 question stems:**
- What variables will you record, and at what intervals?
- What trends or anomalies can you identify in your data?
- How would you classify the changes you have observed?
- What underlying process explains the pattern you have identified?

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- light microscopes
- prepared slides (cheek cells, onion epidermis)
- iodine stain
- methylene blue stain
- cover slips
- glass slides
- mounted needles

**Safety notes:** Handle glass slides and cover slips carefully — they break easily and can cut. Iodine stains skin and clothing. Methylene blue stains are persistent — wear gloves or wash immediately. Cheek cell collection requires hygiene protocol: disposable cotton buds, individual slides, disposal into disinfectant. Do not taste or ingest any stains. (Hazard level: standard)

---

## Expected outcome

Pupils observe cell structures under the microscope, distinguish plant and animal cells, and calculate magnification. Plant cells have cell wall, chloroplasts, and permanent vacuole; animal cells do not. Both have cell membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, and mitochondria.

**Recording format:** labelled scientific diagrams with magnification, comparison table (plant vs animal cells), calculation of actual size

---

## Enquiry type

### Observation Over Time
A systematic enquiry where changes are observed and recorded at intervals over a period of time — hours, days, weeks, or longer. Used when the process being studied is too slow for a single lesson or when the pattern only emerges through repeated observation. Develops patience, systematic recording, and the ability to identify trends.

**KS3 guidance:** At KS3, observations over time become more precise and quantitative. Pupils should use data loggers where appropriate, take repeat measurements, and present results as line graphs with correct axes and units. They should evaluate the reliability of their observation method and suggest improvements. Explanations should reference relevant scientific models.

**Question stems:**
- How does [thing being observed] change over time?
- What happens to [variable] over [time period]?
- What pattern can you see in how [process] changes?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What do you think will happen over time? Why?
- How often should we observe and record?
- What exactly will we look for or measure each time?
- What pattern can you see in the observations?
- Can you explain why this pattern happens?

### Identifying and Classifying
An enquiry where pupils observe, identify, and sort objects, organisms, or materials into groups based on their observable characteristics. Develops careful observation, the ability to select relevant criteria for grouping, and understanding of why classification systems are useful in science.

**KS3 guidance:** At KS3, classification becomes more formal. Pupils should use biological classification systems (Carl Linnaeus), chemical classification (elements, compounds, mixtures), and physical groupings. They should understand hierarchical classification and use dichotomous keys. Criteria should relate to underlying scientific principles, not just surface features.

**Question stems:**
- How can we sort these [items] into groups?
- What properties can we use to classify [these things]?
- Can you make a key to identify [these specimens]?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What can you observe about these [objects/organisms/materials]?
- What properties could you use to sort them?
- How have you decided which group each one belongs to?
- Could you sort them a different way? What would change?
- Can you make a key that someone else could use to identify them?

## Known misconceptions

### Animal cells have no structure
**What pupils may say:** Animal cells do not have any structure — they are just blobs of jelly.
**Correct explanation:** Animal cells have a well-defined internal structure including: a cell membrane (controls what enters and leaves), cytoplasm (where chemical reactions occur), a nucleus (contains DNA and controls the cell), mitochondria (where respiration releases energy), and ribosomes (where proteins are made). What animal cells lack compared to plant cells is a cell wall, chloroplasts, and a large permanent vacuole.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- What structures would you find inside an animal cell?
- What does the nucleus do?
- What is the difference between a cell membrane and a cell wall?

### All cells look the same
**What pupils may say:** All cells look the same — they are all the round shape we draw in books.
**Correct explanation:** Cells are highly specialised for different functions and vary enormously in shape and size. Red blood cells are disc-shaped to carry oxygen efficiently. Nerve cells are long and thin to transmit electrical signals. Root hair cells have extensions to absorb water. Muscle cells are elongated to contract. The shape of a cell is closely linked to its function — this is the structure-function relationship.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- Why are nerve cells long and thin?
- Can you name three types of specialised cell and explain how their shape helps them do their job?
- If all cells looked the same, could they all do the same job?

### Microscope makes things bigger
**What pupils may say:** The microscope makes the actual cell bigger.
**Correct explanation:** The microscope magnifies the image of the cell, not the cell itself. The cell stays exactly the same size on the slide. What changes is the image that reaches your eye — the lenses bend light to produce a larger image. This is why we talk about magnification of the image, not enlargement of the specimen.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- After you look at a cell under a microscope and then remove the slide, is the cell bigger than it was before?
- What does 'magnification' actually mean?
- Does the microscope change the cell or change the image?

## Why this study matters

Observation using microscopy develops essential practical skills that underpin all subsequent biology. Preparing slides, focusing microscopes, and drawing labelled scientific diagrams are core disciplinary practices. Comparing plant and animal cells builds classification skills and introduces the concept of structure-function relationships at the cellular level.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils draw artistic pictures rather than scientific diagrams — explicitly teach the conventions (clean lines, no shading, labels with ruled lines)
2. Difficulty achieving focus at higher magnifications — start with low power and work up systematically
3. Pupils memorise cell parts without understanding their functions — use function-first questioning (e.g. 'what does this cell need to do?')

## Sensitive content

- Cheek cell collection requires a hygiene protocol — use disposable cotton buds and dispose of slides in disinfectant after use
- Some pupils may be uncomfortable providing cheek cell samples — have prepared slides available as an alternative

---

## Working scientifically skills (KS3)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Asking questions** — Posing simple questions about observations and recognising that different types of question require different approaches to find an answer, including tests, observations over time, and looking in books.
- **Observing closely** — Using the senses and simple equipment such as magnifying glasses to make careful first-hand observations of objects, organisms and phenomena.
- **Performing simple tests** — Carrying out simple practical investigations to explore questions, with early awareness that some things should be kept the same while one thing is changed.
- **Identifying and classifying** — Sorting and grouping objects, organisms or materials according to their observable characteristics, recognising that things can be classified in more than one way depending on which features are selected.
- **Using observations to suggest answers** — Making connections between what has been observed and possible answers to questions, explaining reasoning in accessible language and recognising when observations support or challenge initial ideas.
- **Gathering and recording data** — Collecting information from observations or tests and presenting it in simple forms including drawings, labelled diagrams, tables and pictograms to support answering a scientific question.
