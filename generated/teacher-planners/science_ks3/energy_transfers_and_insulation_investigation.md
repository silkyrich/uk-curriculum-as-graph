---

## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **3 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Energy resources (SC-KS3-C111)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Knowledge of different fuels and energy resources

**Teaching guidance:** Classify energy resources as renewable (solar, wind, hydroelectric, tidal, geothermal, biomass) or non-renewable (coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear). For each resource, discuss: how it generates electricity, advantages, disadvantages, and environmental impact. Use data on UK energy generation to analyse the current energy mix and how it is changing. Have pupils evaluate which combination of energy resources would best meet the UK's needs. Connect to climate change (SC-KS3-C106) and sustainability.

**Key vocabulary:** energy resource, renewable, non-renewable, fossil fuel, solar, wind, hydroelectric, tidal, geothermal, biomass, nuclear, generator, turbine, environmental impact, carbon footprint, sustainability

**Common misconceptions:** Students often think nuclear energy is renewable because it does not produce CO₂ during generation — nuclear energy uses finite uranium fuel and produces radioactive waste, making it non-renewable. Students may also think renewable energy sources have no environmental impact — wind farms affect wildlife, hydroelectric dams alter river ecosystems, and solar panels require mining for materials.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knowing that there are different sources of energy, some of which will run out (non-renewable) and some that will not (renewable). | Name two renewable and two non-renewable energy sources. | Thinking nuclear energy is renewable — uranium is finite; Confusing renewable with 'no environmental impact' — all energy sources have some impact |
| **Developing** | Describing how different energy resources generate electricity and comparing their advantages and disadvantages. | Explain how wind turbines generate electricity and give one advantage and one disadvantage. | Saying wind turbines produce 'no pollution' without acknowledging manufacturing and installation impacts; Not mentioning intermittency as the key limitation of wind energy |
| **Secure** | Evaluating the suitability of different energy resources for different contexts, considering reliability, environmental impact, and cost. | A remote island needs a reliable electricity supply. Evaluate whether solar, wind, or diesel generators would be the best primary energy source. | Recommending a single energy source without considering reliability and intermittency; Not suggesting a hybrid approach, which is the practical solution for most real-world situations |
| **Mastery** | Analysing the energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables at national and global scale, including grid-level challenges and the role of emerging technologies. | The UK aims to decarbonise its electricity grid by 2035. Evaluate the main technical challenges and possible solutions. | Suggesting 100% renewables is straightforward without addressing intermittency, storage, and grid infrastructure challenges; Not recognising that the cost of renewable electricity generation is now competitive — the challenge is system integration, not generation cost |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Renewable: solar energy (from sunlight) and wind energy (from moving air). These will not run out because the Sun keeps shining and the wind keeps blowing. Non-renewable: coal and natural gas (fossil fuels). These will eventually run out because they take millions of years to form and we are using them much faster.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Wind turns the blades of the turbine, which drives a generator to produce electricity. The kinetic energy of the wind is converted to electrical energy. Advantage: wind is renewable and produces no CO₂ during operation. Disadvantage: wind is intermittent — when the wind does not blow, no electricity is generated, so backup sources or energy storage are needed. Other factors: wind farms can affect wildlife (bird strikes) and some people consider them visually intrusive in landscapes.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Diesel generators: reliable and can be run on demand, but fuel must be shipped to the island (expensive and vulnerable to supply disruption), produce CO₂ and air pollution, and have ongoing fuel costs. Solar panels: no fuel costs once installed, low maintenance, but output depends on weather and time of day (zero at night), and energy storage (batteries) is needed for continuous supply, adding significant cost. Wind turbines: good for many island locations (often windy coastal sites), but intermittent and require maintenance expertise that may not be available locally. The best solution for most islands is a hybrid system: solar plus wind (their intermittency patterns often complement each other — windy when not sunny and vice versa) with battery storage for short gaps and a small diesel generator as backup for extended calm, cloudy periods. This combination provides reliability while minimising fuel costs and emissions. Many real island communities (e.g., Eigg in Scotland, Ta'u in American Samoa) have adopted this approach successfully.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *The UK generated approximately 42% of its electricity from renewables in 2023, with wind as the largest single source. Reaching 100% decarbonised electricity by 2035 faces several challenges: (1) Intermittency: wind and solar output fluctuates hourly and seasonally. Solutions: grid-scale battery storage (rapidly deploying but expensive), pumped hydro storage (limited UK sites), hydrogen production (electrolysis when surplus renewable electricity is available, burned when needed), and interconnectors to import/export electricity with neighbouring countries. (2) Baseload: the grid needs reliable baseline supply. Solutions: nuclear power (Hinkley Point C under construction), tidal energy (predictable unlike wind/solar), and demand-side management (shifting energy-intensive industry to times of surplus). (3) Grid infrastructure: renewable sources are often far from demand centres (offshore wind in the North Sea, solar in southern England, demand in cities). Solutions: new high-voltage transmission lines, distributed generation (local solar), and smart grid technology. (4) Storage for 'dunkelflaute' events (extended periods of low wind and solar, especially in winter): hydrogen storage, imported interconnector electricity, and retained gas plants with carbon capture for emergency use. (5) Cost: while renewable electricity is now cheaper than fossil fuel electricity per MWh, the total system cost (including storage and grid upgrades) is higher. The technical challenges are solvable — no fundamental physics prevents a decarbonised grid — but the integration, cost, and speed of deployment are the real hurdles.*

### Secondary concept: Thermal equilibrium (SC-KS3-C113)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Understanding heat transfer from hot to cold objects and the role of insulators

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knowing that heat flows from hot objects to cold objects until they reach the same temperature. | Thinking 'cold' flows into the tea — only heat energy transfers, and it goes from hot to cold; Thinking the tea reaches 0°C — it reaches room temperature, not zero |
| **Developing** | Understanding thermal equilibrium and explaining how insulators slow down the rate of heat transfer. | Thinking the jumper generates heat — it only slows heat loss from the body; Not identifying trapped air as the main insulating factor in fibrous materials |
| **Secure** | Explaining conduction, convection, and radiation as mechanisms of heat transfer and designing experiments to compare insulating materials. | Not controlling the thickness of insulation — thicker layers insulate better regardless of material; Forgetting to include a control (uninsulated beaker) for comparison |
| **Mastery** | Analysing heat transfer quantitatively, understanding the role of thermal conductivity, and evaluating insulation in building design. | Not prioritising improvements by cost-effectiveness — loft insulation before triple glazing; Thinking more insulation always equals proportionally more saving — diminishing returns apply |

### Secondary concept: Energy transfer processes (SC-KS3-C114)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Knowledge of processes that involve energy transfer (motion, gravity, electricity, springs, metabolism, combustion)

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knowing that energy can be transferred from one place to another by heating, light, sound, and electricity. | Thinking energy needs a material (medium) to travel — electromagnetic radiation can travel through a vacuum; Not recognising that the Sun transfers energy through radiation, not conduction or convection |
| **Developing** | Identifying energy transfer processes in different contexts and understanding that energy is transferred between stores. | Saying energy is 'used up' rather than transferred between stores; Not identifying the intermediate steps in the energy transfer chain |
| **Secure** | Using the energy stores and transfers model to describe a variety of processes, identifying useful and wasted energy transfers. | Not recognising that most of a car engine's energy output is wasted as heat; Using the phrase 'energy is lost' without specifying it is transferred to thermal energy stores in the surroundings |
| **Mastery** | Analysing energy transfers in complex systems using Sankey diagrams, understanding dissipation, and evaluating the quality of energy. | Thinking the 65% waste is due to poor engineering rather than fundamental thermodynamic limits; Not understanding that the Carnot efficiency sets an absolute upper bound on heat engine efficiency |

### Secondary concept: Energy conservation (SC-KS3-C115)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Understanding that total energy is conserved in any change

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knowing that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred from one store to another. | Thinking friction 'creates' energy — it converts kinetic energy to thermal energy; Believing energy can appear from nowhere or disappear |
| **Developing** | Stating the law of conservation of energy and applying it to track energy through a system. | Thinking energy disappears when the ball stops — it is converted to thermal energy and sound; Not accounting for energy transferred to the surroundings through air resistance |
| **Secure** | Applying conservation of energy quantitatively (Ep = mgh, Ek = ½mv²) and explaining dissipation. | Forgetting to account for air resistance when explaining why measured values are lower than calculated ones; Making errors in the kinetic energy formula — it is ½mv², not mv² |
| **Mastery** | Explaining the distinction between conservation of energy (a universal law) and dissipation (spreading out), and evaluating the implications for perpetual motion machines. | Confusing conservation of energy (a law of physics that always holds) with the practical reversibility of energy transfers (which is limited by dissipation); Thinking perpetual motion violates conservation of energy — it actually violates the second law of thermodynamics |

## Thinking lens: Energy and Matter (primary)

**Key question:** Where does the energy come from, where does it go, and is anything conserved?

**Why this lens fits:** Energy clusters require pupils to trace where energy comes from, how it is transferred or transformed, and where it ends up — conservation and flow are the central ideas.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- Where is the energy stored, and through what pathway does it transfer?
- How is energy dissipated in this process, and why does that matter?
- Can you account for all the matter before and after this change?
- What happens to the total energy in this system?

**Secondary lens:** Systems and System Models — Food chains, food webs and ecosystems are system models: pupils map components (producers, consumers, decomposers), trace energy flows, and predict what happens when one part changes.

## Session structure: Fair Test

### Fair Test
The classic scientific enquiry: formulating a testable question, making a prediction based on scientific understanding, designing a method that controls variables, collecting and recording data systematically, analysing results, and drawing a conclusion linked back to the original hypothesis.

`question` → `hypothesis` → `method` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `conclusion`

**Assessment:** Structured scientific report including question, hypothesis with reasoning, method with variables identified, results table/graph, and conclusion evaluating whether results support the hypothesis.

**Teacher note:** Use the FAIR TEST template: frame a hypothesis in terms of independent, dependent, and control variables. Expect pupils to plan a method that controls variables and selects appropriate equipment for accurate measurement. Guide them to collect repeat measurements, calculate means, and present data graphically. Prompt evaluation of the method including sources of error and reliability of results.

**KS3 question stems:**
- What is your hypothesis, and what scientific reasoning supports it?
- How will you ensure your results are reliable and your test is fair?
- What do your results show, and how confident can you be in this conclusion?
- What sources of error might affect your results, and how could you reduce them?

## Variables

**Independent:** insulation material (bubble wrap, foil, felt, newspaper, none)
**Dependent:** temperature drop over 10 minutes
**Controlled:** same volume of hot water, same starting temperature, same container

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- beakers
- thermometers
- insulation materials (bubble wrap, foil, felt, newspaper)
- hot water (60-70C, prepared by teacher)
- stopwatch
- lids

**Safety notes:** Use warm water (approximately 60-70C), not boiling, for pupil experiments. Teacher handles boiling water for preparation. Thermometers are fragile — handle with care and report breakages immediately. Non-mercury thermometers only. Mop up spills promptly to prevent slipping. (Hazard level: standard)

---

## Expected outcome

Energy is transferred from hot to cold objects by heating. Better insulators reduce the rate of energy transfer. Energy cannot be created or destroyed — it is conserved. Efficiency = useful energy output / total energy input. Pupils can draw cooling curves and calculate efficiency.

**Recording format:** temperature readings every 2 minutes, cooling curve graph, energy transfer diagram, efficiency calculation

---

## Enquiry type

### Fair Test
A controlled investigation where one variable is deliberately changed while all others are kept the same, to determine whether the changed variable has an effect on a measured outcome. The gold-standard enquiry type for causal questions in science.

**KS3 guidance:** At KS3, fair tests become more quantitative. Pupils should take repeat readings and calculate means. They should use correct scientific terminology for variables. Data presentation includes line graphs with lines of best fit. Conclusions should reference scientific models or equations. Evaluation of method reliability is expected.

**Question stems:**
- How does [independent variable] affect [dependent variable]?
- Does changing [variable] make a difference to [outcome]?
- What is the relationship between [variable A] and [variable B]?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What will you change? (independent variable)
- What will you measure or observe? (dependent variable)
- What will you keep the same? (controlled variables)
- What do you predict will happen? Why?
- Was your prediction correct? What does the evidence show?

## Known misconceptions

### Energy is used up
**What pupils may say:** Energy is used up when you use it — it gets used up and is gone.
**Correct explanation:** Energy cannot be created or destroyed — it is conserved (the first law of thermodynamics). When we say energy is 'used', we mean it is transferred from one store to another. Often it is transferred to thermal energy in the surroundings, which is less useful but not gone. The total amount of energy before and after any process is always the same.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- When a battery goes flat, where has the energy gone?
- If energy cannot be destroyed, why do we need to keep buying fuel?
- What does 'conservation of energy' mean?

### Cold flows into objects
**What pupils may say:** Cold flows into warm objects — that is why things cool down.
**Correct explanation:** There is no such thing as 'cold' as a form of energy. What happens is that thermal energy transfers from hotter objects to cooler objects. When you touch a cold window, heat transfers from your warm hand to the cold glass — it feels cold because you are losing heat, not because 'cold' is flowing into you. Energy always transfers from hot to cold, never the other way.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- When you hold an ice cube and it feels cold, is cold flowing into your hand or heat flowing out?
- What direction does thermal energy always transfer?
- Why does a metal spoon feel colder than a wooden spoon at the same temperature?

### Insulators create heat
**What pupils may say:** Insulators make things warmer — a jumper produces heat.
**Correct explanation:** Insulators do not produce heat. They reduce the rate at which thermal energy transfers from a warm object to cooler surroundings. A jumper feels warm because it slows down the loss of heat from your body — your body is the heat source, not the jumper. If you wrapped a jumper around an ice cube, it would slow down the ice melting, not warm it up.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- If you wrap a jumper around an ice cube, will it melt faster or slower?
- Where does the warmth come from when you put on a coat?
- Does insulation produce heat or slow down heat loss?

## Why this study matters

Fair testing insulation provides a concrete, measurable investigation that makes the abstract concept of energy transfer tangible. Pupils can feel the heat loss, measure it quantitatively, and connect the results to the particle model (thermal energy transfers from hot to cold). Calculating efficiency from real data develops mathematical skills alongside conceptual understanding that energy is always conserved but not always usefully transferred.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils say energy is 'used up' or 'lost' — energy is transferred to less useful stores (e.g. thermal energy in the surroundings), not destroyed
2. Confusing temperature with thermal energy — a bath of warm water has more thermal energy than a hot spark, even though the spark is at a higher temperature
3. Difficulty with the efficiency calculation — practise with simple examples before applying to experimental data

## Sensitive content

- Energy poverty is a real issue for some families — be sensitive when discussing home insulation and energy bills

## Working scientifically skills (KS3)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Asking questions** — Posing simple questions about observations and recognising that different types of question require different approaches to find an answer, including tests, observations over time, and looking in books.
- **Observing closely** — Using the senses and simple equipment such as magnifying glasses to make careful first-hand observations of objects, organisms and phenomena.
- **Performing simple tests** — Carrying out simple practical investigations to explore questions, with early awareness that some things should be kept the same while one thing is changed.
- **Identifying and classifying** — Sorting and grouping objects, organisms or materials according to their observable characteristics, recognising that things can be classified in more than one way depending on which features are selected.
- **Using observations to suggest answers** — Making connections between what has been observed and possible answers to questions, explaining reasoning in accessible language and recognising when observations support or challenge initial ideas.
- **Gathering and recording data** — Collecting information from observations or tests and presenting it in simple forms including drawings, labelled diagrams, tables and pictograms to support answering a scientific question.
