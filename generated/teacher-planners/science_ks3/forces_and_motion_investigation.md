---

## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **3 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Speed calculation (SC-KS3-C118)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Understanding and calculating speed using the equation speed = distance ÷ time

**Teaching guidance:** Start with measuring distances and times practically: pupils walk, run, or move toy cars over measured distances and time each journey. Calculate speed using the equation: speed = distance ÷ time (v = s/t). Practise rearranging the equation to find distance (s = v × t) or time (t = s/v). Use the formula triangle as a scaffolding tool. Include both simple calculations and multi-step problems. Use real-world contexts: speed of vehicles, animals, sound, and light. Discuss the difference between instantaneous speed and average speed.

**Key vocabulary:** speed, distance, time, calculation, equation, v = s/t, metres per second, kilometres per hour, miles per hour, average speed, instantaneous speed, formula triangle, rearrangement, unit conversion

**Common misconceptions:** Students often confuse speed and velocity — speed is a scalar (magnitude only), velocity is a vector (magnitude and direction). At KS3, focus on speed but introduce the distinction. Students may also think that a faster object has always travelled further — distance depends on both speed and time.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Recalls the speed equation and substitutes given values with support. | A car travels 100 metres in 20 seconds. Use the equation speed = distance / time to calculate the speed. | Divides time by distance instead of distance by time.; Omits the unit (m/s) from the answer. |
| **Developing** | Calculates speed and rearranges the equation to find distance or time in straightforward problems. | A cyclist travels at 8 m/s for 25 seconds. Calculate the distance travelled. | Uses the wrong rearrangement (e.g. divides instead of multiplying).; Confuses instantaneous speed with average speed when given a journey with stops. |
| **Secure** | Solves multi-step speed problems including unit conversions and distinguishes average speed from instantaneous speed. | A runner completes a 5 km race in 25 minutes. Calculate her average speed in m/s. | Fails to convert km to m or minutes to seconds before calculating.; Reports the answer as km/min without being asked for that unit. |
| **Mastery** | Analyses complex journeys involving multiple stages, compares speeds, and evaluates whether average speed is a useful measure. | A delivery van travels 30 km at 60 km/h and then 20 km at 40 km/h. Calculate the average speed for the whole journey and explain why it is not 50 km/h. | Averages the two speeds (60 + 40)/2 = 50 without calculating total distance and total time.; Treats the problem as though each stage takes the same time rather than checking. |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Speed = 100 / 20 = 5 m/s.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Distance = speed x time = 8 x 25 = 200 m.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *5 km = 5000 m; 25 min = 1500 s. Speed = 5000 / 1500 = 3.3 m/s (1 d.p.).*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Time for first part = 30/60 = 0.5 h. Time for second part = 20/40 = 0.5 h. Total distance = 50 km, total time = 1 h. Average speed = 50/1 = 50 km/h. In this case it happens to be 50 km/h, but average speed is total distance divided by total time, not the mean of the two speeds. If the distances or times differed, the average speed would not equal the mean of the two speeds.*

### Secondary concept: Distance-time graphs (SC-KS3-C119)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Ability to represent and interpret journeys on distance-time graphs

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Identifies basic features of a distance-time graph such as stationary and moving sections. | Thinks a horizontal line means the object is moving at constant speed.; Confuses a distance-time graph with a picture of the journey (e.g. thinks a downward slope means going downhill). |
| **Developing** | Reads values from distance-time graphs and identifies which sections show faster or slower movement. | Judges speed by the length of the line rather than the gradient.; Reads values from the axes inaccurately. |
| **Secure** | Calculates speed from the gradient of a distance-time graph and draws graphs from journey descriptions. | Draws the resting section as a diagonal line continuing upward.; Calculates gradient as distance divided by total time rather than the time for that section. |
| **Mastery** | Interprets curved sections of distance-time graphs as acceleration or deceleration and compares journeys plotted on the same axes. | States the object is moving at constant speed because the line is continuous.; Confuses the shape of a distance-time curve with a velocity-time curve. |

### Secondary concept: Force concept (SC-KS3-C121)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Understanding forces as pushes or pulls from interactions between objects

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Identifies forces as pushes and pulls and gives everyday examples of contact and non-contact forces. | Lists 'motion' or 'speed' as a force.; Cannot distinguish between contact and non-contact forces. |
| **Developing** | Describes forces acting on objects in familiar situations and identifies both objects involved in each interaction. | Names only one force acting on the object.; Says the book exerts gravity rather than the Earth. |
| **Secure** | Explains that forces arise from interactions between pairs of objects and classifies forces systematically as contact or non-contact. | Classifies air resistance as non-contact because you cannot see it.; Forgets that air resistance is a contact force between the skydiver and the air particles. |
| **Mastery** | Analyses complex force scenarios, identifies Newton's third law pairs, and explains why a force is needed to change motion, not to maintain it. | Claims the trolley must be accelerating because a push is applied.; Identifies the push and friction as the Newton's third law pair (they act on the same object and are not a third law pair). |

### Secondary concept: Balanced and unbalanced forces (SC-KS3-C123)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Understanding the difference between balanced and unbalanced forces

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Identifies whether forces on an object are balanced or unbalanced given a simple diagram. | Says the forces are unbalanced because the object is being pushed.; Thinks balanced forces mean no forces are acting. |
| **Developing** | Links balanced forces to constant velocity or being stationary, and unbalanced forces to acceleration or deceleration. | Says there must be an unbalanced downward force because the parachutist is falling.; Thinks balanced forces always mean the object is stationary. |
| **Secure** | Applies Newton's first law to explain why balanced forces do not change an object's motion and analyses real situations. | States the resistive forces must be less than 2500 N because the car is still moving forward.; Confuses constant velocity with zero velocity. |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates how the balance of forces changes over time in dynamic scenarios and explains transitions between balanced and unbalanced states. | States air resistance stays constant throughout the fall.; Thinks terminal velocity means the skydiver has stopped moving. |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Physical phenomena (shadows, circuits, forces) involve clear causal chains: changing one variable produces a predictable effect, making cause-and-effect reasoning the investigative frame.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- Does this show a cause, or just a correlation?
- What is the mechanism — how exactly does A lead to B?
- Which factor had the biggest effect, and how could you tell?
- What evidence would you need to prove this was the cause?

**Secondary lens:** Energy and Matter — Energy clusters require pupils to trace where energy comes from, how it is transferred or transformed, and where it ends up — conservation and flow are the central ideas.

## Session structure: Fair Test

### Fair Test
The classic scientific enquiry: formulating a testable question, making a prediction based on scientific understanding, designing a method that controls variables, collecting and recording data systematically, analysing results, and drawing a conclusion linked back to the original hypothesis.

`question` → `hypothesis` → `method` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `conclusion`

**Assessment:** Structured scientific report including question, hypothesis with reasoning, method with variables identified, results table/graph, and conclusion evaluating whether results support the hypothesis.

**Teacher note:** Use the FAIR TEST template: frame a hypothesis in terms of independent, dependent, and control variables. Expect pupils to plan a method that controls variables and selects appropriate equipment for accurate measurement. Guide them to collect repeat measurements, calculate means, and present data graphically. Prompt evaluation of the method including sources of error and reliability of results.

**KS3 question stems:**
- What is your hypothesis, and what scientific reasoning supports it?
- How will you ensure your results are reliable and your test is fair?
- What do your results show, and how confident can you be in this conclusion?
- What sources of error might affect your results, and how could you reduce them?

## Variables

**Independent:** mass added to trolley / surface type
**Dependent:** time to travel fixed distance / acceleration
**Controlled:** same trolley, same ramp angle, same distance

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- dynamics trolleys
- ramps
- stopwatches
- metre sticks
- Newton meters
- masses
- ticker timers or light gates

**Safety notes:** Ensure trolleys have end stops to prevent them rolling off the bench. Keep masses securely attached to trolleys. Clear the floor area around the ramp to prevent tripping. If using ticker timers, ensure the power supply is set correctly. (Hazard level: low)

---

## Expected outcome

Speed = distance / time. Unbalanced forces cause acceleration. Friction opposes motion. Gravity pulls objects towards Earth. Force diagrams show balanced and unbalanced forces. Pupils can calculate speed, draw and interpret distance-time graphs.

**Recording format:** distance-time data table, speed calculation, distance-time graph, force diagram

## Enquiry type

### Fair Test
A controlled investigation where one variable is deliberately changed while all others are kept the same, to determine whether the changed variable has an effect on a measured outcome. The gold-standard enquiry type for causal questions in science.

**KS3 guidance:** At KS3, fair tests become more quantitative. Pupils should take repeat readings and calculate means. They should use correct scientific terminology for variables. Data presentation includes line graphs with lines of best fit. Conclusions should reference scientific models or equations. Evaluation of method reliability is expected.

**Question stems:**
- How does [independent variable] affect [dependent variable]?
- Does changing [variable] make a difference to [outcome]?
- What is the relationship between [variable A] and [variable B]?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What will you change? (independent variable)
- What will you measure or observe? (dependent variable)
- What will you keep the same? (controlled variables)
- What do you predict will happen? Why?
- Was your prediction correct? What does the evidence show?

## Known misconceptions

### Friction is always unhelpful
**What pupils may say:** Friction is always a bad thing that slows us down.
**Correct explanation:** Friction is essential for many everyday actions. Without friction, you could not walk (your feet would slip), hold a pen, grip a steering wheel, or brake a car. Friction is only unhelpful when it wastes energy or causes wear in machines. Whether friction is helpful or unhelpful depends on the context.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- Can you name three situations where friction is helpful?
- What would happen if there was no friction between your shoes and the floor?
- Is friction always something we want to reduce?

### Constant force needed for constant speed
**What pupils may say:** An object needs a constant force to keep moving at constant speed.
**Correct explanation:** An object moving at constant speed has balanced forces acting on it — the driving force equals the resistive forces (friction, air resistance). No net force is needed to maintain constant velocity. This is Newton's first law: an object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion at constant velocity, unless acted on by an unbalanced force. The confusion arises because on Earth, friction is always present, so we need to push to overcome it — but the push balances friction, it does not cause the motion.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- If you push a box at constant speed across the floor, what forces are acting on it?
- In space with no friction, if you give an object a push and let go, what happens?
- Does a car engine create the force that makes it go, or the force that overcomes friction?

### Heavy objects fall faster
**What pupils may say:** Heavier objects fall faster than lighter objects.
**Correct explanation:** In the absence of air resistance, all objects accelerate at the same rate due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s/s on Earth), regardless of their mass. A feather and a hammer dropped in a vacuum reach the ground at the same time. In air, different objects fall at different rates because of air resistance (which depends on shape and surface area, not mass). A heavy compact object falls faster than a light spread-out one because it experiences proportionally less air resistance relative to its weight.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- If you dropped a football and a tennis ball from the same height (ignoring air resistance), which would land first?
- Why does a feather fall more slowly than a coin in air? Is it because it is lighter?
- On the Moon (where there is no air), a hammer and feather were dropped together. What happened?

### Speed and acceleration confusion
**What pupils may say:** Speed and acceleration are the same thing — a fast object is accelerating.
**Correct explanation:** Speed is how fast an object is moving (distance per unit time). Acceleration is the rate at which speed changes (change in speed per unit time). An object can be moving very fast but not accelerating (constant speed). An object can be moving slowly but accelerating rapidly (just starting to move). A parked car has zero speed and zero acceleration. A car cruising at 70 mph has high speed but zero acceleration.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- A car is travelling at a steady 60 mph on a motorway. Is it accelerating?
- A bicycle starts from rest and speeds up. Is it accelerating? Is it going fast?
- What is the difference between speed and acceleration?

## Why this study matters

Fair testing with trolleys and ramps provides a controlled, repeatable context for collecting quantitative data, calculating speed, and drawing distance-time graphs. The physical setup makes abstract force concepts visible and measurable. Progressing from qualitative observations (faster/slower) to quantitative analysis (speed = distance/time) bridges KS2 forces understanding to the mathematical treatment required at KS3.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils confuse speed and acceleration — speed is how fast something is going; acceleration is how quickly speed is changing
2. Drawing distance-time graphs with time on the y-axis — reinforce that time always goes on the x-axis
3. Pupils think a stationary object has no forces acting on it — stationary objects have balanced forces, not zero forces

## Working scientifically skills (KS3)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Asking questions** — Posing simple questions about observations and recognising that different types of question require different approaches to find an answer, including tests, observations over time, and looking in books.
- **Observing closely** — Using the senses and simple equipment such as magnifying glasses to make careful first-hand observations of objects, organisms and phenomena.
- **Performing simple tests** — Carrying out simple practical investigations to explore questions, with early awareness that some things should be kept the same while one thing is changed.
- **Identifying and classifying** — Sorting and grouping objects, organisms or materials according to their observable characteristics, recognising that things can be classified in more than one way depending on which features are selected.
- **Using observations to suggest answers** — Making connections between what has been observed and possible answers to questions, explaining reasoning in accessible language and recognising when observations support or challenge initial ideas.
- **Gathering and recording data** — Collecting information from observations or tests and presenting it in simple forms including drawings, labelled diagrams, tables and pictograms to support answering a scientific question.
