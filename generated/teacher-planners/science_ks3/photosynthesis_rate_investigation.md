## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Plant nutrition (SC-KS3-C042)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Understanding how plants obtain nutrients: photosynthesis in leaves, water and minerals from roots

**Teaching guidance:** Distinguish between the two ways plants obtain nutrients: (1) photosynthesis in leaves produces glucose using light energy, carbon dioxide and water; (2) roots absorb water and dissolved mineral ions from the soil. Explain that mineral ions (nitrates for protein, phosphates for DNA, magnesium for chlorophyll) are needed in small amounts. Use a practical with mineral-deficient solutions to show the effects of lacking specific minerals on plant growth. Connect to SC-KS3-C051 (photosynthesis).

**Key vocabulary:** photosynthesis, mineral ion, nitrate, phosphate, magnesium, potassium, root hair cell, absorption, active transport, xylem, phloem, glucose, water, carbon dioxide, nutrient deficiency

**Common misconceptions:** Students commonly believe plants get their food from the soil — this is the most persistent misconception in biology. Clarify that plants make their own food (glucose) through photosynthesis; they only absorb water and mineral ions from the soil. Students may also think plants only photosynthesise during the day and only respire at night — plants respire continuously.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that plants need water and sunlight to grow but thinks plants get their food from the soil. | Where do plants get their food from? | Thinking plants absorb food from the soil — this is the most common misconception in biology; Not knowing that plants make their own food through photosynthesis |
| **Developing** | Explains that plants make glucose through photosynthesis using light, CO2, and water, and absorb mineral ions from the soil for other functions. | Explain the difference between what plants get from the soil and what they make themselves. | Confusing the role of minerals (nutrients for specific functions) with food (glucose for energy); Thinking water is the plant's food rather than a raw material for photosynthesis |
| **Secure** | Explains how root hair cells are adapted for mineral and water absorption, links mineral deficiency to specific symptoms, and connects plant nutrition to photosynthesis. | A plant's leaves are turning yellow. The plant receives enough light and water. Suggest a cause and explain the science. | Assuming yellow leaves always mean too little sunlight rather than considering mineral deficiency; Not linking the mineral deficiency to the specific biochemical function (magnesium in chlorophyll) |
| **Mastery** | Compares plant and animal nutrition strategies, evaluates the ecological implications of autotrophic nutrition, and applies plant nutrition science to agricultural challenges. | Explain why farmers add NPK fertiliser to fields, and evaluate the environmental consequences of over-application. | Describing eutrophication without explaining the full chain from fertiliser to algal bloom to oxygen depletion to fish death; Not connecting mineral depletion in fields to the removal of crops at harvest |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Plants get their food from the soil through their roots.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Plants make their own food (glucose) through photosynthesis using light energy, carbon dioxide from the air, and water from the soil. From the soil, plants absorb water and dissolved mineral ions — nitrates for making proteins, phosphates for DNA, and magnesium for chlorophyll. The minerals are not food — they are nutrients needed in small amounts for specific functions.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *The yellow leaves suggest a magnesium deficiency. Magnesium is a mineral ion absorbed from the soil that is essential for making chlorophyll — the green pigment in chloroplasts that absorbs light for photosynthesis. Without sufficient magnesium, the plant cannot produce enough chlorophyll, so leaves turn yellow (chlorosis). This reduces the rate of photosynthesis, limiting glucose production and growth. Root hair cells absorb magnesium by active transport, which requires energy. If the soil is deficient in magnesium, or if the soil is waterlogged (reducing root respiration and therefore active transport), the plant cannot absorb enough.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *NPK fertiliser provides the three mineral ions most commonly limiting plant growth: nitrogen (N) as nitrates for amino acid and protein synthesis, phosphorus (P) as phosphates for DNA and ATP, and potassium (K) for enzyme function and water balance. Crops remove these minerals from the soil when harvested, unlike natural ecosystems where decomposition returns minerals. Without replacement, soil becomes depleted and crop yields decline. However, over-application causes eutrophication: excess nitrates and phosphates are washed into waterways by rain (leaching and run-off), where they stimulate algal blooms. The algae block light from aquatic plants, which die. Decomposing algae and plants consume dissolved oxygen (biochemical oxygen demand), creating hypoxic conditions that kill fish and other aquatic life. This demonstrates a tension between food production and environmental protection. Precision agriculture — applying fertiliser based on soil testing rather than blanket application — can maintain yields while reducing environmental damage.*

### Secondary concept: Stomata function (SC-KS3-C046)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Understanding the role of stomata in plant gas exchange

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that leaves have small holes but does not know their name or specific function. | Not knowing the term 'stomata' (singular: stoma); Not knowing that stomata can open and close |
| **Developing** | Identifies stomata as pores controlled by guard cells, and explains that they allow gas exchange for photosynthesis while also losing water. | Thinking stomata are always open — they close at night or during water stress; Not knowing that most stomata are on the lower surface of leaves |
| **Secure** | Explains the mechanism by which guard cells open and close stomata, and discusses the trade-off between gas exchange and water conservation. | Not explaining the osmotic mechanism — water enters by osmosis, making guard cells turgid; Not recognising the fundamental trade-off between gas exchange and water conservation |
| **Mastery** | Applies stomatal biology to explain plant responses to environmental change, evaluates how rising CO2 levels might affect stomatal density, and connects stomatal function to the global carbon and water cycles. | Not explaining the causal link between CO2 concentration and the evolutionary advantage of fewer stomata; Not connecting changes in stomatal density to the broader water and carbon cycles |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Scientific observations and enquiry serve to establish causal relationships; framing questions around 'what causes X' gives purpose to the observation work.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- Does this show a cause, or just a correlation?
- What is the mechanism — how exactly does A lead to B?
- Which factor had the biggest effect, and how could you tell?
- What evidence would you need to prove this was the cause?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — This cluster asks pupils to gather, record or communicate scientific findings — the core cognitive demand is evaluating what counts as valid evidence and how to present it clearly.

## Session structure: Fair Test

### Fair Test
The classic scientific enquiry: formulating a testable question, making a prediction based on scientific understanding, designing a method that controls variables, collecting and recording data systematically, analysing results, and drawing a conclusion linked back to the original hypothesis.

`question` → `hypothesis` → `method` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `conclusion`

**Assessment:** Structured scientific report including question, hypothesis with reasoning, method with variables identified, results table/graph, and conclusion evaluating whether results support the hypothesis.

**Teacher note:** Use the FAIR TEST template: frame a hypothesis in terms of independent, dependent, and control variables. Expect pupils to plan a method that controls variables and selects appropriate equipment for accurate measurement. Guide them to collect repeat measurements, calculate means, and present data graphically. Prompt evaluation of the method including sources of error and reliability of results.

**KS3 question stems:**
- What is your hypothesis, and what scientific reasoning supports it?
- How will you ensure your results are reliable and your test is fair?
- What do your results show, and how confident can you be in this conclusion?
- What sources of error might affect your results, and how could you reduce them?

## Variables

**Independent:** distance of lamp from pondweed (light intensity)
**Dependent:** number of oxygen bubbles per minute
**Controlled:** same piece of pondweed, same temperature, same volume of water, same concentration of sodium bicarbonate

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- Elodea (pondweed)
- beaker
- lamp
- ruler
- stopwatch
- sodium bicarbonate solution
- thermometer

**Safety notes:** Lamp gets hot — do not touch the bulb during or immediately after use. Ensure water does not contact electrical equipment. Position the lamp securely so it cannot fall into the water. Wash hands after handling pondweed. Sodium bicarbonate is low hazard but avoid ingestion. (Hazard level: standard)

---

## Expected outcome

As light intensity increases (lamp closer), rate of photosynthesis increases (more oxygen bubbles). At high light intensities, the rate levels off because another factor (CO2 or temperature) becomes limiting. Pupils can state the word equation for photosynthesis and explain the concept of limiting factors.

**Recording format:** results table (distance vs bubble count), graph of light intensity vs rate, conclusion linking to photosynthesis equation

## Enquiry type

### Fair Test
A controlled investigation where one variable is deliberately changed while all others are kept the same, to determine whether the changed variable has an effect on a measured outcome. The gold-standard enquiry type for causal questions in science.

**KS3 guidance:** At KS3, fair tests become more quantitative. Pupils should take repeat readings and calculate means. They should use correct scientific terminology for variables. Data presentation includes line graphs with lines of best fit. Conclusions should reference scientific models or equations. Evaluation of method reliability is expected.

**Question stems:**
- How does [independent variable] affect [dependent variable]?
- Does changing [variable] make a difference to [outcome]?
- What is the relationship between [variable A] and [variable B]?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What will you change? (independent variable)
- What will you measure or observe? (dependent variable)
- What will you keep the same? (controlled variables)
- What do you predict will happen? Why?
- Was your prediction correct? What does the evidence show?

## Known misconceptions

### Food from soil
**What pupils may say:** Plants get their food from the soil.
**Correct explanation:** Plants make their own food (glucose) through photosynthesis, using light energy, carbon dioxide from the air, and water from the soil. The soil provides water and minerals, but not food. This is what makes plants producers rather than consumers.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- Where does a plant get its food from?
- If you put a plant in very good soil but no light, would it grow well? Why?
- What is the difference between what plants take from the soil and what they make for themselves?

### Photosynthesis and respiration are opposites
**What pupils may say:** Plants photosynthesise during the day and respire at night — they do one or the other.
**Correct explanation:** Plants respire continuously, 24 hours a day, just like animals. Photosynthesis only occurs when light is available. During daylight, both processes happen simultaneously. The rate of photosynthesis typically exceeds the rate of respiration during the day, so there is a net release of oxygen.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- Do plants respire? When?
- What happens inside a plant at night — does everything stop?
- If plants respire all the time and photosynthesise in light, what gas do they release overall during the day?

### Oxygen is a waste product
**What pupils may say:** Oxygen is a waste product that plants do not need.
**Correct explanation:** Plants use oxygen for their own respiration. The oxygen released during photosynthesis is the excess — the amount produced by photosynthesis exceeds the amount used in respiration. Plants could not survive without oxygen for respiration, just like animals.
**Diagnostic questions:**
- Do plants need oxygen? What do they use it for?
- If a plant produces oxygen during photosynthesis, why doesn't it keep all of it?

## Why this study matters

The pondweed bubble count investigation is a classic fair test that produces clear quantitative data linking light intensity to the rate of photosynthesis. It develops key KS3 skills: controlling variables, collecting repeat data, plotting rate graphs, and explaining results using a chemical equation. The concept of limiting factors introduces pupils to the idea that biological processes are constrained by multiple interacting variables.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils think photosynthesis is the opposite of respiration and plants only do one or the other — plants photosynthesise and respire simultaneously
2. Counting bubbles is unreliable if the pondweed is not acclimatised — allow 2 minutes at each distance before counting
3. Pupils may think only leaves photosynthesise — any green part of a plant containing chloroplasts can photosynthesise

## Working scientifically skills (KS3)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Asking questions** — Posing simple questions about observations and recognising that different types of question require different approaches to find an answer, including tests, observations over time, and looking in books.
- **Observing closely** — Using the senses and simple equipment such as magnifying glasses to make careful first-hand observations of objects, organisms and phenomena.
- **Performing simple tests** — Carrying out simple practical investigations to explore questions, with early awareness that some things should be kept the same while one thing is changed.
- **Identifying and classifying** — Sorting and grouping objects, organisms or materials according to their observable characteristics, recognising that things can be classified in more than one way depending on which features are selected.
- **Using observations to suggest answers** — Making connections between what has been observed and possible answers to questions, explaining reasoning in accessible language and recognising when observations support or challenge initial ideas.
- **Gathering and recording data** — Collecting information from observations or tests and presenting it in simple forms including drawings, labelled diagrams, tables and pictograms to support answering a scientific question.
