## Session structure: Topic Study

### Topic Study
A structured enquiry into a defined topic, period, or place. Begins with an engaging hook to capture interest, builds contextual knowledge, moves through source analysis and interpretation, and culminates in a substantiated argument or conclusion. The core humanities template.

`hook` → `context` → `source_analysis` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Extended writing task presenting a reasoned argument supported by evidence from the topic. Can take the form of an essay, structured explanation, or debate position.

**Teacher note:** Use the TOPIC STUDY template: begin with a simple hook that captures children's curiosity — a picture, an object, or a short story. Provide context through visual and sensory experiences. Guide children to look at one source closely, describing what they can see. Ask them to say what they think it tells us, using 'I think... because...' sentences.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What can you see in this picture?
- What do you think this tells us about life long ago?
- What is the same as today? What is different?
- How do you know? What clues can you spot?

## Why this study matters

Harvest is the most common RS starting point at KS1 because it connects to children's immediate experience (food, nature, seasons) while introducing the concept of thankfulness across multiple religious traditions. Christianity (Harvest Festival), Judaism (Sukkot), and Hinduism (Pongal) all celebrate harvest, providing natural cross-religious comparison at an accessible level.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Reducing harvest to craft activities without the religious dimension
2. Only covering Christian harvest -- use at least two traditions
3. Assuming all families celebrate harvest -- some have no religious connection to it
