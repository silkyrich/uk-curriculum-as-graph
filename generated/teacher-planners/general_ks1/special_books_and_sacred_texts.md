## Session structure: Topic Study

### Topic Study
A structured enquiry into a defined topic, period, or place. Begins with an engaging hook to capture interest, builds contextual knowledge, moves through source analysis and interpretation, and culminates in a substantiated argument or conclusion. The core humanities template.

`hook` → `context` → `source_analysis` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Extended writing task presenting a reasoned argument supported by evidence from the topic. Can take the form of an essay, structured explanation, or debate position.

**Teacher note:** Use the TOPIC STUDY template: begin with a simple hook that captures children's curiosity — a picture, an object, or a short story. Provide context through visual and sensory experiences. Guide children to look at one source closely, describing what they can see. Ask them to say what they think it tells us, using 'I think... because...' sentences.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What can you see in this picture?
- What do you think this tells us about life long ago?
- What is the same as today? What is different?
- How do you know? What clues can you spot?

## Why this study matters

Introducing sacred texts at KS1 teaches that some books are considered special or holy by religious communities. Comparing how different religions treat their sacred texts (the Bible, the Torah, the Quran, the Guru Granth Sahib) teaches respect for difference while establishing that religion involves texts, stories, and teachings that guide behaviour.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Handling sacred texts carelessly -- model how each tradition treats its text with respect
2. Only reading Bible stories -- include at least two different traditions
3. Presenting sacred texts as 'fairy tales' -- teach that believers consider them deeply meaningful
