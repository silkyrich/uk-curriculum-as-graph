## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Plate Tectonics and Geological Processes (GE-KS3-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Plate tectonics is the scientific theory that the Earth's lithosphere is divided into large plates that move relative to each other over geological timescales, driven by convection currents in the mantle. Where plates meet, the interactions produce earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building and ocean trenches. Understanding geological timescales - the vast spans of time over which these processes operate - requires conceptual adjustment from human time frames to geological ones. At KS3, pupils develop understanding of plate tectonics as the unifying theory of physical geography, explaining the distribution of earthquakes, volcanoes and mountain ranges globally.

**Teaching guidance:** Use animated diagrams to show plate movement and the different types of plate boundary (convergent, divergent, transform). Connect plate tectonics to the distribution of volcanoes and earthquakes on a global map. Study specific case studies at different plate boundaries. Explore geological timescales using analogies that make the depth of time comprehensible. Connect to rocks and the rock cycle: how does plate tectonic activity create igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic rocks? Discuss the evidence for plate tectonics: seafloor spreading, fossil distributions, jigsaw fit of continents.

**Key vocabulary:** plate tectonics, lithosphere, mantle, convection, boundary, convergent, divergent, transform, earthquake, volcano, subduction, mountain, ridge, trench, geological timescale

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often think plate movement is fast enough to observe directly. Establishing that continental drift occurs at rates measured in centimetres per year over millions of years develops appropriate scale of time. The mechanism of plate movement (convection currents) is frequently confused with the plates themselves; keeping the two clearly distinct prevents conceptual muddle. The relationship between plate boundaries and the locations of earthquakes and volcanoes needs to be established empirically through map work as well as theoretically.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can recall that earthquakes and volcanoes exist and that they are caused by movements underground, but cannot explain the theory of plate tectonics or the relationship between plate boundaries and hazard distribution. | What causes earthquakes? | Describing the effects of earthquakes rather than explaining the cause; Not connecting earthquakes to the movement of tectonic plates |
| **Developing** | Can describe the basic structure of the Earth and explain that tectonic plates move, causing earthquakes and volcanoes at plate boundaries, with some understanding of different boundary types. | Explain why earthquakes and volcanoes are found in certain locations around the world. Use the theory of plate tectonics in your answer. | Confusing the lithosphere with the crust or the mantle; Not explaining the mechanism by which plate movement causes earthquakes and volcanoes at each type of boundary |
| **Secure** | Can explain the processes at each type of plate boundary in detail, use named case studies to illustrate differential impacts, and connect plate tectonics to the wider geological timescale. | Compare the processes and hazards at constructive and destructive plate boundaries, using named examples. | Describing the processes at plate boundaries without explaining the mechanism clearly; Not using specific named examples to support the comparison |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate the evidence for plate tectonic theory, explain how the theory unifies multiple areas of physical geography, and analyse the implications of geological processes for human societies over different timescales. | How convincing is the evidence for plate tectonic theory? What makes it one of the most important theories in geography? | Listing evidence without explaining how each piece supports the theory; Not explaining why the theory was initially rejected despite Wegener's continental drift hypothesis |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Earthquakes happen when the ground shakes. They are caused by movements of rocks underground.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *The Earth's outer layer (lithosphere) is divided into large tectonic plates that float on the semi-molten mantle beneath. These plates move slowly due to convection currents in the mantle. Where plates meet — at plate boundaries — the movement causes earthquakes and volcanic activity. Earthquakes happen at all three types of boundary (constructive, destructive and conservative) because the movement of plates creates pressure that is released as seismic waves. Volcanoes mainly occur at constructive boundaries (where plates move apart and magma rises to fill the gap) and destructive boundaries (where one plate is subducted beneath another and the melting rock creates magma). This is why earthquakes and volcanoes are concentrated along plate boundary zones like the Pacific Ring of Fire.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *At constructive boundaries (e.g. the Mid-Atlantic Ridge), plates move apart at 2-5cm per year. Magma rises from the mantle to fill the gap, creating new oceanic crust. This produces frequent but relatively gentle earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that tend to be effusive (flowing lava) rather than explosive. Iceland sits on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and experiences both types of hazard. At destructive boundaries (e.g. the Pacific plate subducting beneath the Philippines plate), the denser oceanic plate is forced beneath the less dense continental plate. The subducting plate melts in the mantle, and the resulting magma rises to form explosive composite volcanoes (like Mount Pinatubo, 1991). Earthquakes at destructive boundaries can be extremely powerful because the friction between colliding plates builds up enormous pressure before being released. The 2011 Tohoku earthquake in Japan (magnitude 9.0) occurred at a destructive boundary and caused a devastating tsunami. The key difference is that constructive boundaries produce less hazardous activity (lower magnitude earthquakes, effusive eruptions) while destructive boundaries produce more hazardous activity (high magnitude earthquakes, explosive eruptions, tsunamis), though both are geologically important in reshaping the Earth's surface over millions of years.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Plate tectonic theory is supported by multiple independent lines of evidence, making it one of the best-supported theories in earth science. The evidence includes: (1) the jigsaw fit of continents (South America and Africa fit together, suggesting they were once joined), first noted by Wegener in 1912 but initially dismissed because he could not explain the mechanism; (2) fossil evidence showing identical species on continents now separated by oceans (Mesosaurus fossils in both South America and Africa); (3) rock evidence showing matching rock types and ages on opposite sides of the Atlantic; (4) palaeomagnetic evidence showing alternating bands of magnetic polarity in ocean floor rocks either side of mid-ocean ridges, confirming that new crust is continuously being created and spreading outward; (5) direct measurement using GPS showing that plates are currently moving at measurable rates. The theory is important because it provides a single, unifying explanation for phenomena that were previously understood in isolation: the distribution of earthquakes and volcanoes, the formation of mountain ranges (collision zones), the creation and destruction of oceanic crust, the rock cycle, and the distribution of fossils and mineral resources. It connects geological processes operating over millions of years to hazards that affect human societies today, demonstrating that the apparently stable ground beneath our feet is in constant, slow motion. This has practical implications for hazard prediction, resource exploration, and understanding how the Earth's geography has changed over deep time and will continue to change in the future.*

### Secondary concept: Global Development and Inequality (GE-KS3-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Development refers to the process of improvement in human wellbeing and living standards, measured by indicators such as GDP, HDI, life expectancy, literacy rates and access to services. The geography of development is highly uneven: some parts of the world have achieved high levels of human development while others remain in conditions of poverty and deprivation. Understanding why development is uneven requires analysis of historical factors (colonialism, trade patterns), geographical factors (resource endowment, climate, landlocked position) and current political and economic factors. At KS3, pupils develop the conceptual frameworks to analyse and evaluate patterns of global development.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can recognise that some countries are richer than others but cannot explain why or use development indicators to measure differences. | Using vague language ('rich' and 'poor') without reference to specific indicators; Treating development as a simple binary rather than a spectrum |
| **Developing** | Can describe global patterns of development using named indicators, map their distribution, and explain some basic causes of inequality between countries. | Treating GDP per capita as a complete measure of development without considering its limitations; Not recognising that development is multi-dimensional (economic, social, political) |
| **Secure** | Can analyse the causes of the development gap using multiple factors (historical, physical, economic, political), evaluate strategies for reducing inequality, and use specific country examples to support arguments. | Attributing the development gap entirely to one factor (e.g. climate or corruption) without considering the interaction of multiple causes; Presenting physical factors as deterministic rather than as one influence among several |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate competing theories of development, critically assess the assumptions underlying development indicators and strategies, and connect development geography to contemporary global debates with analytical sophistication. | Either accepting the concept of development uncritically or dismissing it entirely, without engaging with the strengths and limitations of both positions; Not connecting theoretical debates to real examples of alternative development approaches |

### Secondary concept: Climate Change and Environmental Geography (GE-KS3-C003)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns, currently driven primarily by human emissions of greenhouse gases. Understanding climate change requires both physical geography knowledge (the mechanisms of the greenhouse effect, feedback loops, ocean circulation) and human geography knowledge (the economic and social causes of emissions, the uneven distribution of impacts and vulnerabilities, and the politics of international responses). At KS3, pupils develop understanding of climate change as a defining geographical challenge of the contemporary period, combining scientific understanding with social and political analysis.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify that the climate is getting warmer and that this is connected to human activity, but cannot explain the greenhouse effect mechanism or distinguish between weather and climate. | Confusing weather (short-term conditions) with climate (long-term patterns); Describing effects of climate change without explaining the cause |
| **Developing** | Can explain the enhanced greenhouse effect, identify the main greenhouse gases and their sources, and describe the key consequences of climate change using specific evidence. | Confusing the ozone hole with the greenhouse effect (different phenomena with different causes); Not distinguishing between the natural greenhouse effect and the enhanced greenhouse effect |
| **Secure** | Can analyse the geographically differentiated impacts of climate change, explain feedback mechanisms, and evaluate different response strategies (mitigation vs adaptation) with specific examples. | Presenting climate change as having uniform impacts everywhere; Not connecting vulnerability to both physical exposure and economic capacity to adapt |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate the political and economic barriers to climate action, critically assess different response strategies at multiple scales, and connect climate change to broader questions of global justice and sustainability. | Presenting the obstacles to climate action as either trivial or insurmountable, rather than as serious but addressable challenges; Not recognising the global justice dimension of climate policy |

## Thinking lens: Systems and System Models (primary)

**Key question:** What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?

**Why this lens fits:** Plate tectonics is an Earth system process — the movement of tectonic plates drives volcanic activity, earthquakes, mountain building and ocean formation through interlocking physical mechanisms operating over geological time, requiring pupils to model a large-scale physical system.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- What feedback loops exist in this system?
- Does this model capture all the important interactions, or does it oversimplify?
- What emergent property arises from these components interacting?
- How would removing or adding a component change the system's behaviour?

**Secondary lens:** Stability and Change — The tectonic framework explains both the stability of plate interiors and the instability at plate boundaries where hazards occur; pupils must understand why some regions are geologically stable while others experience frequent catastrophic change.

## Session structure: Case Study

### Case Study
An in-depth investigation of a specific real-world example, location, or scenario. Starts with locating and describing the case in context, collects and organises relevant data, analyses patterns and processes, compares with other cases where appropriate, and reaches an evaluative conclusion.

`locate_and_describe` → `introduction` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `comparison` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Written case study report with data presentation (tables, graphs, maps), analysis of findings, and evaluative conclusion that addresses the original enquiry question.

**Teacher note:** Use the CASE STUDY template: introduce the case with relevant locational or contextual data. Guide pupils through systematic data collection using maps, statistics, or fieldwork records. Prompt structured analysis using appropriate geographical, scientific, or business frameworks. Expect pupils to draw comparisons, identify patterns, and evaluate the significance of their findings.

**KS3 question stems:**
- What data do we need to collect to understand this case thoroughly?
- What patterns emerge from the data, and how significant are they?
- How does this case compare to others, and what explains the differences?
- What are the limitations of the data available for this case?

## Study scope

**Scale:** National
**Themes:** preparedness, resilience, technology, cascading hazards

**Map types:** hazard overlay, gis, population density, topographic
**Data sources:** USGS, Japan Meteorological Agency, IAEA, World Bank

## Locations

### Tohoku Region (Japan, Asia, region, national)
**Development context:** HIC
**Key physical features:** Pacific Ring of Fire, subduction zone, coastal plain, mountainous interior
**Key human features:** Sendai (1 million), Fukushima nuclear plant, tsunami walls, early warning systems


---

## Contrasting localities

### Haiti vs Japan: Development and Disaster
The Haiti-Japan pairing is the most widely used tectonic hazard contrast in English secondary schools because the two events occurred within 14 months of each other, enabling clean comparison while exposing the critical role of development and governance in disaster outcomes. The contrast prevents simplistic narratives by requiring analysis of why wealth alone does not guarantee safety (Fukushima).

**Compare through:** development level, governance quality, preparedness infrastructure, casualty toll relative to magnitude, cascading effects, international response
**Stimulus questions:**
- Japan's earthquake was 100x more powerful than Haiti's. Why did Haiti lose 10x more people?
- Does money make you safe from earthquakes?
- What does the Fukushima meltdown tell us about the limits of preparedness?
- If you could spend $1 billion on earthquake preparedness in one country, which would you choose and why?


---

## Why this study matters

Japan provides a contrasting HIC case study where advanced technology and preparedness systems significantly reduce vulnerability to tectonic hazards, but cascading effects (tsunami, nuclear meltdown) demonstrate that no country can eliminate risk entirely. The contrast with Haiti enables rigorous comparative analysis of how development affects disaster outcomes.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Oversimplifying the comparison as 'rich country = fewer deaths' without analysing specific preparedness measures and their limitations
2. Neglecting the Fukushima nuclear dimension as a cascading hazard, which complicates the 'technology makes you safe' narrative
3. Failing to distinguish between earthquake and tsunami impacts, which have different causes and preparedness strategies

## Sensitive content

- Significant loss of life (c.20,000 deaths) — handle with sensitivity
- Nuclear disaster at Fukushima — discuss factually, avoid sensationalism

---

## Success criteria

**Pupils can:**
- Explain the tectonic cause including subduction and tsunami generation
- Compare Japan's preparedness and outcomes with Haiti's
- Evaluate the role of technology in hazard management
- Explain what 'cascading hazard' means using the Fukushima example

## Geographical skills (KS3)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Using maps, atlases and globes** — Locating and identifying places in the United Kingdom and wider world using world maps, atlases and globes as reference tools, understanding that these are representations of the real world at reduced scale.
- **Using compass directions and locational language** — Applying the four cardinal compass directions (North, South, East, West) and everyday directional language such as near, far, left and right to describe the location of features and routes on maps and in the environment.
- **Using aerial photographs and making simple maps** — Interpreting aerial photographs and plan-perspective images to recognise landmarks and physical and human features, and translating these observations into a simple hand-drawn map with a basic symbol key.
- **Simple fieldwork and observational skills** — Going out into the school grounds and immediate surrounding environment to observe, describe and record human and physical geographical features at first hand, practising the habits of direct geographical enquiry.
- **Using maps, atlases, globes and digital mapping** — Extending atlas and map use to locate countries and describe the features studied across the curriculum, and beginning to use digital and computer mapping tools — including online satellite maps — to access geographical information in a range of formats.
- **Eight-point compass and Ordnance Survey map skills** — Applying the eight compass points, four-figure and six-figure grid references, and the symbols and conventions of Ordnance Survey maps to build knowledge of the UK and the wider world, and to navigate and locate features on topographic maps.
