## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **3 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Climate Change and Environmental Geography (GE-KS3-C003)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns, currently driven primarily by human emissions of greenhouse gases. Understanding climate change requires both physical geography knowledge (the mechanisms of the greenhouse effect, feedback loops, ocean circulation) and human geography knowledge (the economic and social causes of emissions, the uneven distribution of impacts and vulnerabilities, and the politics of international responses). At KS3, pupils develop understanding of climate change as a defining geographical challenge of the contemporary period, combining scientific understanding with social and political analysis.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach the physical mechanism of the enhanced greenhouse effect clearly before moving to its consequences. Distinguish between climate (long-term patterns) and weather (short-term conditions), and between natural climate variability and human-induced change. Map the vulnerability of different places to climate change impacts: sea level rise, drought, extreme weather. Explore the uneven responsibility for and impact of climate change. Discuss different responses: mitigation (reducing emissions), adaptation (adjusting to change) and geo-engineering. Connect to pupils' local environment: how might this area change?

**Key vocabulary:** climate change, greenhouse effect, greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, global warming, feedback, sea level, extreme weather, mitigation, adaptation, vulnerability, emissions, fossil fuel, renewable energy

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may confuse the ozone hole with the greenhouse effect; these are distinct phenomena with different causes, mechanisms and solutions. The idea that climate change is natural and has always occurred can be used to dismiss human-induced change; distinguishing natural variability from anthropogenic change is crucial. The concept of feedback loops is counterintuitive for many pupils; concrete examples (melting permafrost releasing methane, reduced ice reflecting less sunlight) make feedbacks tangible.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify that the climate is getting warmer and that this is connected to human activity, but cannot explain the greenhouse effect mechanism or distinguish between weather and climate. | What is climate change? | Confusing weather (short-term conditions) with climate (long-term patterns); Describing effects of climate change without explaining the cause |
| **Developing** | Can explain the enhanced greenhouse effect, identify the main greenhouse gases and their sources, and describe the key consequences of climate change using specific evidence. | Explain how human activity is causing the enhanced greenhouse effect. | Confusing the ozone hole with the greenhouse effect (different phenomena with different causes); Not distinguishing between the natural greenhouse effect and the enhanced greenhouse effect |
| **Secure** | Can analyse the geographically differentiated impacts of climate change, explain feedback mechanisms, and evaluate different response strategies (mitigation vs adaptation) with specific examples. | Explain why the impacts of climate change are not the same everywhere. Use named examples to illustrate your answer. | Presenting climate change as having uniform impacts everywhere; Not connecting vulnerability to both physical exposure and economic capacity to adapt |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate the political and economic barriers to climate action, critically assess different response strategies at multiple scales, and connect climate change to broader questions of global justice and sustainability. | Why has international action on climate change been so difficult to achieve despite scientific consensus? Evaluate the obstacles and assess whether they can be overcome. | Presenting the obstacles to climate action as either trivial or insurmountable, rather than as serious but addressable challenges; Not recognising the global justice dimension of climate policy |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Climate change is when the Earth gets warmer because of pollution. The ice caps are melting and the sea is rising.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *The natural greenhouse effect is essential for life: gases like carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere trap heat from the Sun, keeping the Earth about 33 degrees warmer than it would otherwise be. The enhanced greenhouse effect is caused by human activity increasing the concentration of these gases. Burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) for energy and transport releases carbon dioxide. Deforestation reduces the number of trees that absorb CO2. Agriculture produces methane (from cattle and rice paddies) and nitrous oxide (from fertilisers). Since the Industrial Revolution, atmospheric CO2 has increased from about 280ppm to over 420ppm. This extra CO2 traps more heat, raising global temperatures by approximately 1.1 degrees C since pre-industrial times. Evidence includes: rising global temperatures measured by weather stations, melting Arctic sea ice visible in satellite images, rising sea levels measured by tide gauges, and ice core data showing that current CO2 levels are higher than at any point in the last 800,000 years.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Climate change impacts are geographically differentiated because vulnerability depends on both physical exposure and human capacity to adapt. Low-lying island nations like Tuvalu and the Maldives face existential threat from sea level rise despite contributing almost nothing to global emissions. The Arctic is warming at twice the global average rate due to Arctic amplification (the feedback effect where melting ice reduces the reflective surface, causing more heat absorption), threatening indigenous communities and ecosystems. Sub-Saharan Africa faces increased drought and desertification, threatening food security for hundreds of millions of people who depend on rain-fed agriculture. Meanwhile, some higher-latitude regions (parts of Russia, Canada) may initially benefit from warmer temperatures through longer growing seasons and access to previously frozen resources. This geographical inequality is also an ethical issue: the countries most vulnerable to climate change are often those that contributed least to causing it. Low-income countries are more vulnerable because they have fewer resources for adaptation — they cannot afford flood defences, drought-resistant crops, or emergency response systems. Feedback mechanisms amplify these impacts: permafrost thawing releases stored methane (a potent greenhouse gas), further accelerating warming; coral bleaching from ocean warming reduces marine biodiversity and threatens the food and tourism economies of coastal communities.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *International climate action faces interconnected political, economic and structural obstacles that explain the gap between scientific consensus and policy response. The first obstacle is the free-rider problem: reducing emissions is costly for individual nations, but the benefits of emission reduction are shared globally. This creates an incentive for each country to continue emitting while hoping others will cut. The Paris Agreement (2015) attempted to address this through voluntary national pledges, but enforcement mechanisms are weak. The second obstacle is economic path dependence: fossil fuel industries are deeply embedded in national economies, employing millions and generating government revenue. Countries dependent on fossil fuel exports (Saudi Arabia, Russia) have structural economic incentives to delay the transition. The third obstacle is temporal mismatch: the costs of mitigation are immediate and concentrated, while the benefits are long-term and dispersed. Politicians operating on four or five-year electoral cycles face pressure to prioritise short-term economic concerns. The fourth obstacle is global justice: low-income countries argue that they should not sacrifice economic development to solve a problem primarily caused by industrialised nations, while high-income countries resist paying the full costs of adaptation in the developing world. These obstacles are formidable but not insurmountable. Falling renewable energy costs have made the economic case for transition stronger; growing public awareness has increased political pressure; and the increasing visibility of climate impacts has reduced the scope for denial. The most productive approach combines international agreements (setting targets), national policy (carbon pricing, regulation), technological innovation (renewables, storage, carbon capture) and local action (community energy, behaviour change). No single strategy is sufficient, and the question is whether the combined effect will be fast enough to limit warming to manageable levels.*

### Secondary concept: Plate Tectonics and Geological Processes (GE-KS3-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Plate tectonics is the scientific theory that the Earth's lithosphere is divided into large plates that move relative to each other over geological timescales, driven by convection currents in the mantle. Where plates meet, the interactions produce earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building and ocean trenches. Understanding geological timescales - the vast spans of time over which these processes operate - requires conceptual adjustment from human time frames to geological ones. At KS3, pupils develop understanding of plate tectonics as the unifying theory of physical geography, explaining the distribution of earthquakes, volcanoes and mountain ranges globally.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can recall that earthquakes and volcanoes exist and that they are caused by movements underground, but cannot explain the theory of plate tectonics or the relationship between plate boundaries and hazard distribution. | Describing the effects of earthquakes rather than explaining the cause; Not connecting earthquakes to the movement of tectonic plates |
| **Developing** | Can describe the basic structure of the Earth and explain that tectonic plates move, causing earthquakes and volcanoes at plate boundaries, with some understanding of different boundary types. | Confusing the lithosphere with the crust or the mantle; Not explaining the mechanism by which plate movement causes earthquakes and volcanoes at each type of boundary |
| **Secure** | Can explain the processes at each type of plate boundary in detail, use named case studies to illustrate differential impacts, and connect plate tectonics to the wider geological timescale. | Describing the processes at plate boundaries without explaining the mechanism clearly; Not using specific named examples to support the comparison |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate the evidence for plate tectonic theory, explain how the theory unifies multiple areas of physical geography, and analyse the implications of geological processes for human societies over different timescales. | Listing evidence without explaining how each piece supports the theory; Not explaining why the theory was initially rejected despite Wegener's continental drift hypothesis |

### Secondary concept: Global Development and Inequality (GE-KS3-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Development refers to the process of improvement in human wellbeing and living standards, measured by indicators such as GDP, HDI, life expectancy, literacy rates and access to services. The geography of development is highly uneven: some parts of the world have achieved high levels of human development while others remain in conditions of poverty and deprivation. Understanding why development is uneven requires analysis of historical factors (colonialism, trade patterns), geographical factors (resource endowment, climate, landlocked position) and current political and economic factors. At KS3, pupils develop the conceptual frameworks to analyse and evaluate patterns of global development.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can recognise that some countries are richer than others but cannot explain why or use development indicators to measure differences. | Using vague language ('rich' and 'poor') without reference to specific indicators; Treating development as a simple binary rather than a spectrum |
| **Developing** | Can describe global patterns of development using named indicators, map their distribution, and explain some basic causes of inequality between countries. | Treating GDP per capita as a complete measure of development without considering its limitations; Not recognising that development is multi-dimensional (economic, social, political) |
| **Secure** | Can analyse the causes of the development gap using multiple factors (historical, physical, economic, political), evaluate strategies for reducing inequality, and use specific country examples to support arguments. | Attributing the development gap entirely to one factor (e.g. climate or corruption) without considering the interaction of multiple causes; Presenting physical factors as deterministic rather than as one influence among several |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate competing theories of development, critically assess the assumptions underlying development indicators and strategies, and connect development geography to contemporary global debates with analytical sophistication. | Either accepting the concept of development uncritically or dismissing it entirely, without engaging with the strengths and limitations of both positions; Not connecting theoretical debates to real examples of alternative development approaches |

### Secondary concept: Population, Urbanisation and Migration (GE-KS3-C004)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Population geography examines the distribution, density, composition and change of human populations. Urbanisation is the process by which an increasing proportion of a population lives in cities, driven by rural-to-urban migration in search of economic opportunities. Migration is the movement of people between places, driven by push factors (poverty, conflict, climate hazards) and pull factors (economic opportunity, safety, family). At KS3, pupils develop understanding of the major demographic processes reshaping the contemporary world: global population growth, urbanisation, ageing populations in wealthy countries and migration at local, national and global scales.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify that the world's population is growing and that many people live in cities, but cannot explain the processes driving population change or urbanisation. | Not distinguishing between urbanisation (proportion) and urban growth (absolute numbers); Giving only one reason for urbanisation without considering multiple push and pull factors |
| **Developing** | Can describe global patterns of population growth and urbanisation, explain push-pull factors driving migration, and use the demographic transition model to explain population change. | Listing push and pull factors without explaining how they interact to produce migration; Assuming that urbanisation always leads to better outcomes for migrants |
| **Secure** | Can analyse the causes and consequences of population change and urbanisation at multiple scales, compare experiences in different development contexts, and evaluate the challenges and opportunities created by demographic change. | Presenting urbanisation in LICs as entirely negative without acknowledging the opportunities cities provide; Not comparing the two contexts systematically using the same analytical categories |
| **Mastery** | Can critically evaluate theoretical models of population and urbanisation, connect demographic change to broader global issues (development, environment, migration), and assess the implications of current trends for the future. | Treating the DTM as a predictive model that tells us what will happen rather than a generalised description of what has happened; Not considering the cultural and political factors that make different countries' demographic transitions distinctive |

## Thinking lens: Systems and System Models (primary)

**Key question:** What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?

**Why this lens fits:** Plate tectonics is an Earth system process — the movement of tectonic plates drives volcanic activity, earthquakes, mountain building and ocean formation through interlocking physical mechanisms operating over geological time, requiring pupils to model a large-scale physical system.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- What feedback loops exist in this system?
- Does this model capture all the important interactions, or does it oversimplify?
- What emergent property arises from these components interacting?
- How would removing or adding a component change the system's behaviour?

**Secondary lens:** Stability and Change — The tectonic framework explains both the stability of plate interiors and the instability at plate boundaries where hazards occur; pupils must understand why some regions are geologically stable while others experience frequent catastrophic change.

## Session structure: Case Study + Secondary Data Analysis

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Case Study (main structure)
An in-depth investigation of a specific real-world example, location, or scenario. Starts with locating and describing the case in context, collects and organises relevant data, analyses patterns and processes, compares with other cases where appropriate, and reaches an evaluative conclusion.

`locate_and_describe` → `introduction` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `comparison` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Written case study report with data presentation (tables, graphs, maps), analysis of findings, and evaluative conclusion that addresses the original enquiry question.

**Teacher note:** Use the CASE STUDY template: introduce the case with relevant locational or contextual data. Guide pupils through systematic data collection using maps, statistics, or fieldwork records. Prompt structured analysis using appropriate geographical, scientific, or business frameworks. Expect pupils to draw comparisons, identify patterns, and evaluate the significance of their findings.

**KS3 question stems:**
- What data do we need to collect to understand this case thoroughly?
- What patterns emerge from the data, and how significant are they?
- How does this case compare to others, and what explains the differences?
- What are the limitations of the data available for this case?

### Secondary Data Analysis
An enquiry using existing published data sets rather than first-hand collection. Pupils frame an enquiry question, select and evaluate appropriate data sources, process and present data using statistical or graphical methods, analyse patterns and anomalies, evaluate reliability, and present findings.

`question_framing` → `data_selection` → `processing` → `analysis` → `evaluation` → `presentation`

**Assessment:** Data analysis report including processed data presented in appropriate formats, statistical analysis where relevant, interpretation of findings, and evaluation of data reliability and limitations.

**Teacher note:** Use the SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS template: present a dataset or set of published findings relevant to a geographical, scientific, or mathematical question. Guide pupils to frame a question the data can address, select relevant data, process it using appropriate techniques, and analyse the results. Prompt evaluation of what the data shows and the limitations of secondary sources.

**KS3 question stems:**
- What question can this dataset help us answer?
- How will you process this data to reveal patterns or trends?
- What does the analysis show, and how confident can you be?
- What are the limitations of using someone else's data to answer your question?

## Why this study matters

Climate change is a statutory area of study at KS3 that integrates physical geography (greenhouse effect, feedback loops) with human geography (emissions inequality, international cooperation). The global scope with regional case studies ensures pupils understand both the science and the unequal distribution of causes and impacts, developing the evaluative skills needed for informed citizenship.

## Geographical skills (KS3)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Using maps, atlases and globes** — Locating and identifying places in the United Kingdom and wider world using world maps, atlases and globes as reference tools, understanding that these are representations of the real world at reduced scale.
- **Using compass directions and locational language** — Applying the four cardinal compass directions (North, South, East, West) and everyday directional language such as near, far, left and right to describe the location of features and routes on maps and in the environment.
- **Using aerial photographs and making simple maps** — Interpreting aerial photographs and plan-perspective images to recognise landmarks and physical and human features, and translating these observations into a simple hand-drawn map with a basic symbol key.
- **Simple fieldwork and observational skills** — Going out into the school grounds and immediate surrounding environment to observe, describe and record human and physical geographical features at first hand, practising the habits of direct geographical enquiry.
- **Using maps, atlases, globes and digital mapping** — Extending atlas and map use to locate countries and describe the features studied across the curriculum, and beginning to use digital and computer mapping tools — including online satellite maps — to access geographical information in a range of formats.
- **Eight-point compass and Ordnance Survey map skills** — Applying the eight compass points, four-figure and six-figure grid references, and the symbols and conventions of Ordnance Survey maps to build knowledge of the UK and the wider world, and to navigate and locate features on topographic maps.
