## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **3 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Global Development and Inequality (GE-KS3-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Development refers to the process of improvement in human wellbeing and living standards, measured by indicators such as GDP, HDI, life expectancy, literacy rates and access to services. The geography of development is highly uneven: some parts of the world have achieved high levels of human development while others remain in conditions of poverty and deprivation. Understanding why development is uneven requires analysis of historical factors (colonialism, trade patterns), geographical factors (resource endowment, climate, landlocked position) and current political and economic factors. At KS3, pupils develop the conceptual frameworks to analyse and evaluate patterns of global development.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce a range of development indicators and discuss their strengths and limitations. Map the global distribution of development and identify patterns. Study specific countries at different levels of development using a range of data sources. Analyse the causes of uneven development using multiple factors. Discuss the debate between different theories of development (modernisation, dependency, bottom-up). Connect to trade, aid, debt and migration as mechanisms through which development is shaped. Evaluate proposed solutions to development challenges critically.

**Key vocabulary:** development, GDP, HDI, literacy, life expectancy, inequality, poverty, wealth, aid, trade, debt, colonialism, dependency, sustainable development, indicator

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may view development as a simple linear progression from 'undeveloped' to 'developed', missing the complexity and political contestation involved. The assumption that more development is always better can be challenged by discussing environmental costs and alternative conceptions of wellbeing. Using the terminology 'developing' and 'developed' can mislead; discussing alternative framings (Global North/South, high-income/low-income) develops more nuanced vocabulary.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can recognise that some countries are richer than others but cannot explain why or use development indicators to measure differences. | What does it mean to say a country is 'developed' or 'developing'? | Using vague language ('rich' and 'poor') without reference to specific indicators; Treating development as a simple binary rather than a spectrum |
| **Developing** | Can describe global patterns of development using named indicators, map their distribution, and explain some basic causes of inequality between countries. | Explain how GDP per capita and life expectancy can be used to measure development. What are the limitations of each? | Treating GDP per capita as a complete measure of development without considering its limitations; Not recognising that development is multi-dimensional (economic, social, political) |
| **Secure** | Can analyse the causes of the development gap using multiple factors (historical, physical, economic, political), evaluate strategies for reducing inequality, and use specific country examples to support arguments. | Explain the causes of the development gap between high-income and low-income countries. Consider at least three different types of factor. | Attributing the development gap entirely to one factor (e.g. climate or corruption) without considering the interaction of multiple causes; Presenting physical factors as deterministic rather than as one influence among several |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate competing theories of development, critically assess the assumptions underlying development indicators and strategies, and connect development geography to contemporary global debates with analytical sophistication. | Some geographers argue that the concept of 'development' is itself problematic because it assumes all countries should follow the same path as Western nations. Evaluate this argument. | Either accepting the concept of development uncritically or dismissing it entirely, without engaging with the strengths and limitations of both positions; Not connecting theoretical debates to real examples of alternative development approaches |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *A developed country is rich and has good hospitals and schools. A developing country is poor and does not have as much.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *GDP per capita measures the total value of goods and services produced by a country divided by its population, giving an average income figure. Countries with high GDP per capita (e.g. USA, UK, Japan) are generally considered more developed. However, GDP per capita is limited because it is an average that hides inequality: a country with a few very rich people and many poor people might have a high GDP per capita without most people being well off. Life expectancy measures the average age a person can expect to live, which reflects healthcare quality, nutrition and living conditions. Countries with high life expectancy (e.g. Japan at 84 years) tend to have better healthcare systems. Its limitation is that it does not capture quality of life — a country could have high life expectancy but low educational attainment or few political freedoms. This is why composite measures like HDI, which combine multiple indicators, give a more complete picture of development.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *The development gap has multiple interacting causes. Historical factors are fundamental: colonialism extracted wealth, raw materials and labour from colonised territories for centuries, creating economic structures that benefited colonial powers while impoverishing colonies. Many former colonies inherited economies dependent on exporting a narrow range of raw materials (commodity dependence), making them vulnerable to price fluctuations. For example, many sub-Saharan African countries still rely heavily on mineral or agricultural exports. Physical factors also play a role: countries in tropical climates face higher disease burdens (malaria, tropical diseases) and some agricultural limitations; landlocked countries face higher trade costs; and countries vulnerable to natural disasters face repeated economic setbacks. Economic factors perpetuate inequality: unfair terms of trade mean that raw materials from low-income countries are worth less than manufactured goods from high-income countries; debt burdens divert government spending from health and education to interest payments; and multinational corporations may extract profits rather than reinvesting locally. Political factors include corruption, conflict and governance quality, which affect how effectively resources are used. However, it is important to avoid attributing the development gap to any single factor: the interaction between colonial legacies, physical geography, trade structures and governance creates a complex web of disadvantage that no single intervention can resolve.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *This critique raises important questions about the assumptions underlying development geography. The traditional development model (modernisation theory, associated with Rostow's stages of growth) assumed that all countries would progress through the same stages from 'traditional' to 'modern' society, essentially following the path of Western industrialisation. This model has been criticised on several grounds. First, it treats Western economic development as the universal standard, ignoring alternative conceptions of wellbeing that may prioritise community, spiritual life, environmental sustainability or equality over GDP growth. Bhutan's Gross National Happiness index explicitly challenges the assumption that economic growth is the primary measure of progress. Second, the model ignores the historical conditions that enabled Western development — including the extraction of colonial wealth — and therefore blames low-income countries for failing to replicate a process that depended on exploitation of others. Dependency theorists (Frank, Wallerstein) argue that the underdevelopment of the Global South is not a stage to be overcome but a structural consequence of the same global economic system that produced Western wealth. Third, the environmental implications of universal Western-style development are unsustainable: if all countries achieved the resource consumption levels of the USA, the planet could not sustain it. However, the critique can be taken too far. Dismissing the concept of development entirely risks denying the reality that people in many countries lack clean water, adequate nutrition, healthcare and education — deficiencies that cause genuine human suffering regardless of cultural context. The most productive approach may be to retain the concept of development while expanding its definition beyond economic growth to encompass environmental sustainability, human capabilities (Amartya Sen's capabilities approach), and the right of communities to define their own priorities.*

### Secondary concept: Climate Change and Environmental Geography (GE-KS3-C003)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns, currently driven primarily by human emissions of greenhouse gases. Understanding climate change requires both physical geography knowledge (the mechanisms of the greenhouse effect, feedback loops, ocean circulation) and human geography knowledge (the economic and social causes of emissions, the uneven distribution of impacts and vulnerabilities, and the politics of international responses). At KS3, pupils develop understanding of climate change as a defining geographical challenge of the contemporary period, combining scientific understanding with social and political analysis.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify that the climate is getting warmer and that this is connected to human activity, but cannot explain the greenhouse effect mechanism or distinguish between weather and climate. | Confusing weather (short-term conditions) with climate (long-term patterns); Describing effects of climate change without explaining the cause |
| **Developing** | Can explain the enhanced greenhouse effect, identify the main greenhouse gases and their sources, and describe the key consequences of climate change using specific evidence. | Confusing the ozone hole with the greenhouse effect (different phenomena with different causes); Not distinguishing between the natural greenhouse effect and the enhanced greenhouse effect |
| **Secure** | Can analyse the geographically differentiated impacts of climate change, explain feedback mechanisms, and evaluate different response strategies (mitigation vs adaptation) with specific examples. | Presenting climate change as having uniform impacts everywhere; Not connecting vulnerability to both physical exposure and economic capacity to adapt |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate the political and economic barriers to climate action, critically assess different response strategies at multiple scales, and connect climate change to broader questions of global justice and sustainability. | Presenting the obstacles to climate action as either trivial or insurmountable, rather than as serious but addressable challenges; Not recognising the global justice dimension of climate policy |

### Secondary concept: Population, Urbanisation and Migration (GE-KS3-C004)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Population geography examines the distribution, density, composition and change of human populations. Urbanisation is the process by which an increasing proportion of a population lives in cities, driven by rural-to-urban migration in search of economic opportunities. Migration is the movement of people between places, driven by push factors (poverty, conflict, climate hazards) and pull factors (economic opportunity, safety, family). At KS3, pupils develop understanding of the major demographic processes reshaping the contemporary world: global population growth, urbanisation, ageing populations in wealthy countries and migration at local, national and global scales.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify that the world's population is growing and that many people live in cities, but cannot explain the processes driving population change or urbanisation. | Not distinguishing between urbanisation (proportion) and urban growth (absolute numbers); Giving only one reason for urbanisation without considering multiple push and pull factors |
| **Developing** | Can describe global patterns of population growth and urbanisation, explain push-pull factors driving migration, and use the demographic transition model to explain population change. | Listing push and pull factors without explaining how they interact to produce migration; Assuming that urbanisation always leads to better outcomes for migrants |
| **Secure** | Can analyse the causes and consequences of population change and urbanisation at multiple scales, compare experiences in different development contexts, and evaluate the challenges and opportunities created by demographic change. | Presenting urbanisation in LICs as entirely negative without acknowledging the opportunities cities provide; Not comparing the two contexts systematically using the same analytical categories |
| **Mastery** | Can critically evaluate theoretical models of population and urbanisation, connect demographic change to broader global issues (development, environment, migration), and assess the implications of current trends for the future. | Treating the DTM as a predictive model that tells us what will happen rather than a generalised description of what has happened; Not considering the cultural and political factors that make different countries' demographic transitions distinctive |

### Secondary concept: World Regions: Africa, Asia and the Middle East (GE-KS3-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

A detailed working knowledge of the world's major geographical regions, with KS3 focus extending to Africa, Russia, Asia (including China and India) and the Middle East. This includes awareness of the environmental regions within these areas (deserts, savannahs, tropical forests, tundra, mountain systems), the major countries and their capitals, the distribution of major cities, and the key physical and human characteristics that give each region its geographical character. At KS3, locational knowledge moves beyond naming towards understanding: why are cities located where they are? How do environmental regions reflect climate and geology? How do physical characteristics shape the human geography of the region?

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can name some countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East but has very limited knowledge of their locations, characteristics or the regional geography of these areas. | Knowing very few countries outside Europe and North America; Treating Africa or Asia as a single undifferentiated region |
| **Developing** | Can locate major countries, capitals and physical features across Africa, Asia, Russia and the Middle East, and describe the main environmental regions with reference to climate and landscape. | Listing environmental regions without explaining the pattern of their distribution; Not recognising the enormous internal geographical diversity of Africa |
| **Secure** | Can use locational knowledge to support analysis of geographical processes and issues, connecting the spatial distribution of countries, cities and environmental regions to thematic topics like development, urbanisation and climate change. | Treating locational knowledge as separate from thematic geography rather than as the spatial framework for understanding processes; Not connecting physical geography features to human geography patterns |
| **Mastery** | Can critically evaluate how regional knowledge is constructed and represented, challenge stereotypical portrayals of regions, and use sophisticated locational understanding to analyse global interconnections. | Accepting media stereotypes uncritically rather than testing them against geographical evidence; Replacing negative stereotypes with positive ones rather than developing a nuanced, evidence-based understanding |

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** Building fluent locational knowledge of major world regions involves recognising the spatial patterns of political boundaries, physical features and population distribution — not just memorising names but understanding why countries, cities and landscapes are distributed as they are.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- Can you describe this pattern precisely enough for someone else to continue it?
- Does this pattern hold for all cases, or only some?
- How could you test whether this is a real pattern or a coincidence?
- Can you express this pattern as a rule or formula?

**Secondary lens:** Systems and System Models — Plate tectonics is an Earth system process — the movement of tectonic plates drives volcanic activity, earthquakes, mountain building and ocean formation through interlocking physical mechanisms operating over geological time, requiring pupils to model a large-scale physical system.

## Session structure: Case Study

### Case Study
An in-depth investigation of a specific real-world example, location, or scenario. Starts with locating and describing the case in context, collects and organises relevant data, analyses patterns and processes, compares with other cases where appropriate, and reaches an evaluative conclusion.

`locate_and_describe` → `introduction` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `comparison` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Written case study report with data presentation (tables, graphs, maps), analysis of findings, and evaluative conclusion that addresses the original enquiry question.

**Teacher note:** Use the CASE STUDY template: introduce the case with relevant locational or contextual data. Guide pupils through systematic data collection using maps, statistics, or fieldwork records. Prompt structured analysis using appropriate geographical, scientific, or business frameworks. Expect pupils to draw comparisons, identify patterns, and evaluate the significance of their findings.

**KS3 question stems:**
- What data do we need to collect to understand this case thoroughly?
- What patterns emerge from the data, and how significant are they?
- How does this case compare to others, and what explains the differences?
- What are the limitations of the data available for this case?

## Study scope

**Scale:** National
**Themes:** development indicators, inequality, resource curse, urbanisation, trade

**Map types:** choropleth, population density, flow map, thematic map
**Data sources:** World Bank, UNDP, Nigerian National Bureau of Statistics, UN Population Division

**Assessment guidance:** Can pupils use multiple development indicators to build a nuanced picture of Nigeria? Can they explain why GDP alone is an inadequate measure of development? Can they analyse the 'resource curse' concept and evaluate whether oil has helped or hindered Nigeria's development?

## Locations

### Federal Republic of Nigeria (Nigeria, Africa, country, national)
**Development context:** LIC
**Key physical features:** River Niger, Sahel (north), tropical forest (south), Jos Plateau, Niger Delta
**Key human features:** 220 million population, Lagos megacity, oil industry, Nollywood, north-south divide


---

## Why this study matters

Nigeria exemplifies the complexity of development: Africa's largest economy with vast oil wealth yet deep regional inequalities and persistent poverty. The case study challenges simplistic 'developing country' narratives, introducing pupils to the resource curse concept and the limitations of single development indicators like GDP. Nigeria's internal diversity (north-south divide, rural-urban contrast) makes it ideal for nuanced development analysis.

## Sequencing

**Follows:** Trade, Economic Geography and Fairtrade

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Treating Nigeria as representative of all of Africa — emphasise it is one of 54 diverse countries
2. Relying solely on GDP as a development measure without exploring HDI, literacy, regional disparities
3. Presenting the resource curse as inevitable rather than as a political and governance challenge

## Sensitive content

- Boko Haram and regional conflict — handle factually, avoid sensationalising violence
- Poverty and inequality — avoid deficit framing; show agency, enterprise, and cultural richness alongside challenges

---

## Success criteria

**Pupils can:**
- Use multiple indicators (GDP, HDI, literacy) to describe Nigeria's development
- Explain the limitations of single development indicators
- Analyse regional inequalities within Nigeria using data
- Evaluate whether oil wealth has helped or hindered Nigeria's development

## Geographical skills (KS3)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Using maps, atlases and globes** — Locating and identifying places in the United Kingdom and wider world using world maps, atlases and globes as reference tools, understanding that these are representations of the real world at reduced scale.
- **Using compass directions and locational language** — Applying the four cardinal compass directions (North, South, East, West) and everyday directional language such as near, far, left and right to describe the location of features and routes on maps and in the environment.
- **Using aerial photographs and making simple maps** — Interpreting aerial photographs and plan-perspective images to recognise landmarks and physical and human features, and translating these observations into a simple hand-drawn map with a basic symbol key.
- **Simple fieldwork and observational skills** — Going out into the school grounds and immediate surrounding environment to observe, describe and record human and physical geographical features at first hand, practising the habits of direct geographical enquiry.
- **Using maps, atlases, globes and digital mapping** — Extending atlas and map use to locate countries and describe the features studied across the curriculum, and beginning to use digital and computer mapping tools — including online satellite maps — to access geographical information in a range of formats.
- **Eight-point compass and Ordnance Survey map skills** — Applying the eight compass points, four-figure and six-figure grid references, and the symbols and conventions of Ordnance Survey maps to build knowledge of the UK and the wider world, and to navigate and locate features on topographic maps.
