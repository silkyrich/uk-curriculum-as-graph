## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Population, Urbanisation and Migration (GE-KS3-C004)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Population geography examines the distribution, density, composition and change of human populations. Urbanisation is the process by which an increasing proportion of a population lives in cities, driven by rural-to-urban migration in search of economic opportunities. Migration is the movement of people between places, driven by push factors (poverty, conflict, climate hazards) and pull factors (economic opportunity, safety, family). At KS3, pupils develop understanding of the major demographic processes reshaping the contemporary world: global population growth, urbanisation, ageing populations in wealthy countries and migration at local, national and global scales.

**Teaching guidance:** Use population pyramids to analyse population structure and predict future trends. Map the global distribution of population and explain the factors that determine population density. Study urbanisation in contrasting global contexts: high-income and low-income countries. Examine specific megacities and their challenges. Analyse migration using push-pull frameworks and case studies. Discuss the causes and consequences of population change for environments, economies and societies. Connect to current news and events involving migration, refugees and demographic change.

**Key vocabulary:** population, density, distribution, urbanisation, migration, push factor, pull factor, refugee, megacity, suburb, demographics, birth rate, death rate, natural increase, ageing population

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may assume that population growth is necessarily problematic. The relationship between population density and resource availability is more complex; discussing both overpopulated and underpopulated regions challenges simple correlations. Migration is often portrayed as a problem rather than as a long-standing human response to opportunity and threat; a balanced examination of causes and consequences develops more nuanced understanding. The demographic transition model is a useful but simplified framework; discussing its limitations develops critical thinking.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify that the world's population is growing and that many people live in cities, but cannot explain the processes driving population change or urbanisation. | Why are cities getting bigger? | Not distinguishing between urbanisation (proportion) and urban growth (absolute numbers); Giving only one reason for urbanisation without considering multiple push and pull factors |
| **Developing** | Can describe global patterns of population growth and urbanisation, explain push-pull factors driving migration, and use the demographic transition model to explain population change. | Explain why people migrate from rural areas to cities in low-income countries. Give specific push and pull factors. | Listing push and pull factors without explaining how they interact to produce migration; Assuming that urbanisation always leads to better outcomes for migrants |
| **Secure** | Can analyse the causes and consequences of population change and urbanisation at multiple scales, compare experiences in different development contexts, and evaluate the challenges and opportunities created by demographic change. | Compare the causes and challenges of urbanisation in a high-income country and a low-income country. Use named examples. | Presenting urbanisation in LICs as entirely negative without acknowledging the opportunities cities provide; Not comparing the two contexts systematically using the same analytical categories |
| **Mastery** | Can critically evaluate theoretical models of population and urbanisation, connect demographic change to broader global issues (development, environment, migration), and assess the implications of current trends for the future. | How useful is the demographic transition model for understanding population change in different parts of the world? What are its limitations? | Treating the DTM as a predictive model that tells us what will happen rather than a generalised description of what has happened; Not considering the cultural and political factors that make different countries' demographic transitions distinctive |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Cities are getting bigger because more people want to live in them. People move to cities for jobs.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *People migrate from rural areas to cities because of a combination of push factors (reasons to leave) and pull factors (reasons to go). Push factors include: poverty and low wages in agriculture; lack of services such as schools and hospitals in rural areas; natural disasters like drought or flooding that destroy crops; and land shortages as rural populations grow. Pull factors include: perceived job opportunities in factories, construction and services; higher wages (urban workers typically earn more than agricultural workers); better access to education, healthcare and other services; and the excitement and opportunities of city life. In countries like Nigeria, rural-urban migration has been driven by the oil economy concentrated in cities like Lagos, while rural agriculture remains underfunded. However, urban reality often does not match expectations: many migrants end up in informal settlements with poor housing, sanitation and limited formal employment.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Urbanisation in high-income countries (HICs) and low-income countries (LICs) differs in its pace, causes and challenges. In the UK, urbanisation occurred gradually over two centuries during industrialisation (1750-1950) and has now levelled at about 83% urban. Current trends include counter-urbanisation (movement out of cities to suburbs and rural areas) and re-urbanisation (regeneration of inner-city areas). Challenges include: housing affordability, traffic congestion, urban deprivation in inner cities, and pressure on the green belt. In Lagos, Nigeria, urbanisation is rapid and ongoing: the population has grown from about 1 million in 1960 to over 15 million today, driven by massive rural-urban migration and high natural increase. This pace of growth far outstrips the capacity to provide infrastructure, resulting in widespread informal settlements (e.g. Makoko, a floating slum), inadequate water supply and sanitation, air and water pollution, and a congested transport network. The key difference is that UK urbanisation occurred over centuries with gradually improving infrastructure, while Lagos is experiencing in decades what London experienced over two centuries, without the same financial resources to manage growth. However, both cities face the challenge of creating sustainable urban environments: reducing emissions, providing affordable housing, and managing social inequality. Lagos also demonstrates urban resilience and innovation: community-based organisations, informal economic activity, and grassroots solutions to service provision show that rapid urbanisation generates both problems and creative responses.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *The demographic transition model (DTM) is a useful generalisation but has significant limitations that prevent it from being a reliable predictive tool. The model describes five stages of population change, from high birth rate and high death rate (Stage 1) through declining death rate with high birth rate (Stage 2, rapid growth) to low birth rate and low death rate (Stage 4/5, population stability or decline). Its usefulness lies in describing the broad pattern that most industrialised countries have followed and providing a framework for understanding the relationship between economic development, healthcare improvement, urbanisation and fertility decline. However, the limitations are substantial. First, the model was based on European historical experience and assumes all countries will follow the same path, which ignores the different economic, cultural and political contexts of contemporary developing countries. Second, it does not explain the mechanisms of change: why exactly does industrialisation lead to lower birth rates? Cultural factors (education of women, religious attitudes to contraception, government population policies) vary enormously between countries and produce very different fertility patterns. China's one-child policy (1979-2015) produced a dramatic fertility decline through state coercion, quite different from the gradual social change the model describes. Third, the model does not account for countries that have become 'stuck' in Stage 2-3 due to conflict, governance failures or the HIV/AIDS epidemic (e.g. several sub-Saharan African countries). Fourth, Stage 5 (population decline) was not part of the original model and presents challenges (ageing populations, declining workforces) that the model does not predict or explain. The most productive approach uses the DTM as a descriptive framework while recognising that real population change is shaped by specific historical, cultural and political factors that no single model can capture.*

### Secondary concept: Global Development and Inequality (GE-KS3-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Development refers to the process of improvement in human wellbeing and living standards, measured by indicators such as GDP, HDI, life expectancy, literacy rates and access to services. The geography of development is highly uneven: some parts of the world have achieved high levels of human development while others remain in conditions of poverty and deprivation. Understanding why development is uneven requires analysis of historical factors (colonialism, trade patterns), geographical factors (resource endowment, climate, landlocked position) and current political and economic factors. At KS3, pupils develop the conceptual frameworks to analyse and evaluate patterns of global development.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can recognise that some countries are richer than others but cannot explain why or use development indicators to measure differences. | Using vague language ('rich' and 'poor') without reference to specific indicators; Treating development as a simple binary rather than a spectrum |
| **Developing** | Can describe global patterns of development using named indicators, map their distribution, and explain some basic causes of inequality between countries. | Treating GDP per capita as a complete measure of development without considering its limitations; Not recognising that development is multi-dimensional (economic, social, political) |
| **Secure** | Can analyse the causes of the development gap using multiple factors (historical, physical, economic, political), evaluate strategies for reducing inequality, and use specific country examples to support arguments. | Attributing the development gap entirely to one factor (e.g. climate or corruption) without considering the interaction of multiple causes; Presenting physical factors as deterministic rather than as one influence among several |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate competing theories of development, critically assess the assumptions underlying development indicators and strategies, and connect development geography to contemporary global debates with analytical sophistication. | Either accepting the concept of development uncritically or dismissing it entirely, without engaging with the strengths and limitations of both positions; Not connecting theoretical debates to real examples of alternative development approaches |

### Secondary concept: Climate Change and Environmental Geography (GE-KS3-C003)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns, currently driven primarily by human emissions of greenhouse gases. Understanding climate change requires both physical geography knowledge (the mechanisms of the greenhouse effect, feedback loops, ocean circulation) and human geography knowledge (the economic and social causes of emissions, the uneven distribution of impacts and vulnerabilities, and the politics of international responses). At KS3, pupils develop understanding of climate change as a defining geographical challenge of the contemporary period, combining scientific understanding with social and political analysis.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify that the climate is getting warmer and that this is connected to human activity, but cannot explain the greenhouse effect mechanism or distinguish between weather and climate. | Confusing weather (short-term conditions) with climate (long-term patterns); Describing effects of climate change without explaining the cause |
| **Developing** | Can explain the enhanced greenhouse effect, identify the main greenhouse gases and their sources, and describe the key consequences of climate change using specific evidence. | Confusing the ozone hole with the greenhouse effect (different phenomena with different causes); Not distinguishing between the natural greenhouse effect and the enhanced greenhouse effect |
| **Secure** | Can analyse the geographically differentiated impacts of climate change, explain feedback mechanisms, and evaluate different response strategies (mitigation vs adaptation) with specific examples. | Presenting climate change as having uniform impacts everywhere; Not connecting vulnerability to both physical exposure and economic capacity to adapt |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate the political and economic barriers to climate action, critically assess different response strategies at multiple scales, and connect climate change to broader questions of global justice and sustainability. | Presenting the obstacles to climate action as either trivial or insurmountable, rather than as serious but addressable challenges; Not recognising the global justice dimension of climate policy |

## Thinking lens: Systems and System Models (primary)

**Key question:** What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?

**Why this lens fits:** Plate tectonics is an Earth system process — the movement of tectonic plates drives volcanic activity, earthquakes, mountain building and ocean formation through interlocking physical mechanisms operating over geological time, requiring pupils to model a large-scale physical system.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- What feedback loops exist in this system?
- Does this model capture all the important interactions, or does it oversimplify?
- What emergent property arises from these components interacting?
- How would removing or adding a component change the system's behaviour?

**Secondary lens:** Stability and Change — The tectonic framework explains both the stability of plate interiors and the instability at plate boundaries where hazards occur; pupils must understand why some regions are geologically stable while others experience frequent catastrophic change.

## Session structure: Case Study + Comparison Study

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Case Study (main structure)
An in-depth investigation of a specific real-world example, location, or scenario. Starts with locating and describing the case in context, collects and organises relevant data, analyses patterns and processes, compares with other cases where appropriate, and reaches an evaluative conclusion.

`locate_and_describe` → `introduction` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `comparison` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Written case study report with data presentation (tables, graphs, maps), analysis of findings, and evaluative conclusion that addresses the original enquiry question.

**Teacher note:** Use the CASE STUDY template: introduce the case with relevant locational or contextual data. Guide pupils through systematic data collection using maps, statistics, or fieldwork records. Prompt structured analysis using appropriate geographical, scientific, or business frameworks. Expect pupils to draw comparisons, identify patterns, and evaluate the significance of their findings.

**KS3 question stems:**
- What data do we need to collect to understand this case thoroughly?
- What patterns emerge from the data, and how significant are they?
- How does this case compare to others, and what explains the differences?
- What are the limitations of the data available for this case?

### Comparison Study
A structured comparison of two or more examples, places, periods, or perspectives. Introduces each example with sufficient context, applies a systematic comparison framework, analyses similarities and differences with supporting evidence, and reaches an evaluative conclusion about the significance of those differences.

`introduce_examples` → `systematic_comparison` → `analysis` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Comparative analysis using a structured framework (table, Venn diagram, or essay), demonstrating understanding of both examples and reaching a substantiated evaluative conclusion.

**Teacher note:** Use the COMPARISON STUDY template: introduce the examples with relevant contextual detail and guide pupils to develop their own criteria for comparison. Expect systematic analysis using appropriate frameworks, with attention to both similarities and differences. Prompt pupils to evaluate the significance of the comparison and consider what it reveals about broader patterns or processes.

**KS3 question stems:**
- What criteria will you use for comparison, and why are they appropriate?
- What does this comparison reveal about broader patterns or processes?
- Are the differences more significant than the similarities, or vice versa?
- How might the context explain both the similarities and the differences?

## Contrasting localities

### Lagos vs London: Urbanisation in LIC and HIC
Contrasting Lagos and London prevents the common trap of studying only 'problem' urbanisation in LICs. Both cities face genuine challenges (housing costs, pollution, transport congestion) but of fundamentally different kinds. The comparison illuminates how development level shapes the urbanisation experience while revealing universal urban challenges.

**Compare through:** rate of urban growth, informal vs formal housing, transport infrastructure, economic opportunity, environmental quality, governance and planning
**Stimulus questions:**
- Lagos is growing 6x faster than London. What are the consequences of this speed?
- Both cities have housing crises. How are they different, and how are they similar?
- Is rapid urbanisation a problem or an opportunity? For whom?
- What can Lagos and London learn from each other about sustainable urban planning?


---

## Why this study matters

Contrasting Lagos (rapid megacity growth in a LIC) with London (managed growth in a HIC) enables pupils to explore urbanisation as a global process with radically different local manifestations. The comparison illuminates push-pull factors, informal settlement challenges, and sustainable urban planning, while avoiding the trap of studying only 'problem' urbanisation in developing countries.

## Sequencing

**Follows:** Trade, Economic Geography and Fairtrade

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Presenting Lagos purely as a city of problems (poverty, slums) without showing its economic dynamism and cultural vibrancy
2. Treating London as the 'solution' and Lagos as the 'problem' — both cities face serious challenges
3. Using outdated data or imagery that does not reflect current urban change in either city

## Sensitive content

- Informal settlements — avoid 'slum tourism' framing; discuss with dignity and structural analysis
- Housing inequality in London — sensitive for pupils who may experience housing insecurity

---

## Success criteria

**Pupils can:**
- Explain push-pull factors driving urbanisation in Lagos
- Compare challenges in Lagos and London using data
- Evaluate the effectiveness of urban management strategies
- Explain the concept of sustainable urban development with examples

## Geographical skills (KS3)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Using maps, atlases and globes** — Locating and identifying places in the United Kingdom and wider world using world maps, atlases and globes as reference tools, understanding that these are representations of the real world at reduced scale.
- **Using compass directions and locational language** — Applying the four cardinal compass directions (North, South, East, West) and everyday directional language such as near, far, left and right to describe the location of features and routes on maps and in the environment.
- **Using aerial photographs and making simple maps** — Interpreting aerial photographs and plan-perspective images to recognise landmarks and physical and human features, and translating these observations into a simple hand-drawn map with a basic symbol key.
- **Simple fieldwork and observational skills** — Going out into the school grounds and immediate surrounding environment to observe, describe and record human and physical geographical features at first hand, practising the habits of direct geographical enquiry.
- **Using maps, atlases, globes and digital mapping** — Extending atlas and map use to locate countries and describe the features studied across the curriculum, and beginning to use digital and computer mapping tools — including online satellite maps — to access geographical information in a range of formats.
- **Eight-point compass and Ordnance Survey map skills** — Applying the eight compass points, four-figure and six-figure grid references, and the symbols and conventions of Ordnance Survey maps to build knowledge of the UK and the wider world, and to navigate and locate features on topographic maps.
