### Primary concept: Geographical Skills: GIS, Maps and Fieldwork (GE-KS3-C007)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Geographical skills at KS3 encompass the technical and methodological competencies that geographers use to collect, represent, analyse and communicate spatial information. These include cartographic skills (reading and interpreting Ordnance Survey maps at various scales, using grid references and contours), use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) as digital tools for visualising and analysing spatial data, and the planning and execution of fieldwork in contrasting locations. KS3 fieldwork extends beyond the local environment into contrasting urban, rural, coastal and inland locations, developing the ability to collect primary data, apply analytical techniques and draw evidence-based geographical conclusions. GIS skills connect traditional cartographic literacy to contemporary digital geographical practice.

**Teaching guidance:** Develop map skills in genuine geographical contexts rather than as isolated exercises: use OS maps when studying the landscapes in their area, use atlases when studying global distributions. GIS teaching is most effective when pupils use it to answer real geographical questions: where should a new supermarket be located? What areas are at risk of flooding? Fieldwork should be planned as a genuine enquiry, not merely as a data-collection exercise: pupils should understand what question they are investigating and why their chosen methods are appropriate. Develop digital map literacy alongside traditional OS skills: Google Earth, Google Maps and open data platforms are the tools pupils will use in adult life.

**Key vocabulary:** GIS, Ordnance Survey, grid reference, contour, scale, topographic, thematic map, aerial photograph, satellite image, fieldwork, primary data, secondary data, spatial data, layer, overlay, enquiry

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may treat OS map reading as a purely academic exercise rather than as a practical skill with real applications; connecting map work to fieldwork locations they have visited makes the skill purposeful. GIS is sometimes taught as a technical tool rather than as a geographical thinking tool; framing GIS use around geographical questions (where? why there? what patterns?) maintains the geographical focus. Pupils may think that fieldwork data collection is straightforward; the issues of sampling bias, measurement error and reliability require explicit discussion.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can use simple map skills (compass directions, identifying features on a map) but struggles with grid references, scale, contour interpretation and more advanced cartographic techniques. | Using the OS map extract, give the four-figure grid reference for the church. | Confusing eastings and northings when reading grid references; Not understanding what contour lines represent on a map |
| **Developing** | Can use four and six-figure grid references accurately, interpret basic contour patterns, use map scale to measure distances, and understand the purpose of fieldwork data collection. | Using the OS map, describe the relief of the area in grid square 3456. Identify the highest and lowest points. | Describing what is on the map without interpreting what it means geographically; Not using specific height data from contour lines and spot heights |
| **Secure** | Can integrate map skills, GIS and fieldwork methods to conduct genuine geographical enquiry, selecting appropriate techniques, collecting data systematically and drawing evidence-based conclusions. | You are planning a fieldwork investigation into how land use changes from the centre to the edge of a town. Describe the methods you would use and explain why they are appropriate. | Describing methods without justifying why they are appropriate for the enquiry question; Not identifying the limitations of the chosen methods |
| **Mastery** | Can critically evaluate the strengths and limitations of different geographical skills and technologies, assess the reliability and validity of fieldwork data, and use GIS as an analytical tool for answering complex geographical questions. | How has GIS technology changed the way geographers investigate spatial patterns? Evaluate both the opportunities and the limitations of GIS-based analysis. | Treating GIS as a neutral, objective tool without recognising how data selection and presentation shape conclusions; Focusing on technical capabilities of GIS without evaluating its limitations and appropriate uses |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *[Attempts to give a grid reference but reverses eastings and northings, giving an incorrect answer.]*

> **Model response (Developing):** *The area in grid square 3456 shows hilly terrain. The contour lines are closely spaced on the western side, indicating a steep slope rising from about 50 metres to over 150 metres. The highest point is a hilltop at approximately 168 metres (shown by the spot height). The eastern side has more widely spaced contours, showing a gentler slope. A river valley runs through the southern part of the square, visible from the V-shaped contour patterns pointing upstream.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *I would use a transect method, walking a straight line from the town centre to the edge and recording land use at regular intervals (every 100 metres). At each sampling point I would record: the dominant land use (residential, commercial, industrial, green space), the building age and condition (using a bipolar evaluation scale), traffic count (vehicles per minute for 5 minutes) and environmental quality (litter, noise, vegetation). I would use an OS map to plan my route and a GPS device to record exact locations. This systematic sampling approach is appropriate because it ensures regular spatial coverage along the transect, making the data comparable between points. The bipolar evaluation provides quantitative data from qualitative observations, which can be graphed to show patterns. I would present the data using a land use map, a graph showing how environmental quality changes along the transect, and annotated photographs. The limitation of a single transect is that it only represents one line through the town — different directions might show different patterns. To address this, I could repeat the transect in multiple directions, but time constraints may prevent this. The enquiry would be strengthened by comparing primary data with secondary data (census data, historical maps) to understand how the pattern has changed over time.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *GIS (Geographical Information Systems) has fundamentally transformed geographical investigation by enabling the analysis of complex spatial relationships that were previously impossible or impractical to study. GIS allows multiple data layers (population density, land use, elevation, flood risk, transport networks, demographic data) to be overlaid and analysed together, revealing patterns and correlations that individual maps cannot show. For example, overlaying flood risk maps with population density and deprivation data can identify which communities are most vulnerable to flooding — a question that requires the integration of physical and human data at multiple scales. GIS also enables rapid analysis of large datasets: mapping crime patterns across a city, modelling the impact of sea level rise on coastal communities, or identifying optimal locations for new infrastructure. However, GIS has important limitations. First, the quality of output depends entirely on the quality of input data ('garbage in, garbage out'): if the underlying data is inaccurate, outdated or collected at inappropriate scales, the analysis will be misleading despite appearing authoritative because of its digital format. Second, GIS can create a false impression of precision: colour-coded maps suggest clear boundaries between categories when the reality is often gradual and uncertain. Third, GIS analysis risks being technocratic — reducing complex human geographies to data points and algorithms — if it is not grounded in qualitative understanding of the places and communities being mapped. The most effective geographical investigation combines GIS analysis with fieldwork, local knowledge and critical interpretation, using technology as a tool for geographical thinking rather than a substitute for it.*

## Thinking lens: Evidence and Argument (primary)

**Key question:** What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?

**Why this lens fits:** Designing a fieldwork enquiry, collecting primary data, and processing and presenting findings to answer a geographical question is a complete evidence-to-argument cycle — pupils must ensure their data collection methods generate reliable evidence and then construct geographical arguments from it.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- How reliable is this evidence, and what makes you say so?
- What counter-argument could someone make, and how would you respond?
- Is this the only conclusion the evidence supports, or are there alternatives?
- What additional evidence would strengthen or weaken this argument?

**Secondary lens:** Patterns — Statistical and cartographic techniques are used to reveal spatial and temporal patterns in geographical data; the purpose of GIS and fieldwork data processing is precisely to make patterns visible that would otherwise be obscured in raw observations.

## Session structure: Fieldwork

### Fieldwork
Learning through direct observation and data collection in the field (or simulated field environment). Includes preparation and planning, systematic data collection using fieldwork techniques, data processing and presentation, analysis of findings, and a conclusion that addresses the enquiry question.

`preparation` → `field_data_collection` → `processing` → `analysis` → `conclusion`

**Assessment:** Fieldwork report including methodology, data presentation using appropriate techniques (maps, graphs, tables, photographs), analysis of patterns, and conclusion with evaluation of data reliability.

**Teacher note:** Use the FIELDWORK template: plan a structured data collection activity with clear sampling strategy and appropriate techniques. Expect pupils to use a range of fieldwork equipment and recording methods. Guide data processing using maps, graphs, or GIS where appropriate. Prompt critical analysis that connects field data to the enquiry question and evaluates the quality of evidence collected.

**KS3 question stems:**
- What sampling strategy will you use, and why is it appropriate?
- How will you process and present your field data?
- What does your data reveal about the enquiry question?
- What are the limitations of the data you collected in the field?

## Why this study matters

Fieldwork is a statutory KS3 requirement that develops the geographical enquiry skills that distinguish geography as a discipline: formulating questions, designing methodology, collecting primary data, analysing findings, and evaluating conclusions. The requirement for contrasting locations ensures pupils experience different geographical environments.

## Sequencing

**Follows:** Geographical Skills and Fieldwork

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Treating fieldwork as a data-collection exercise rather than a genuine enquiry — pupils need to understand the question driving the investigation
2. Collecting data without teaching pupils to evaluate its reliability, representativeness, and limitations
3. Using only one fieldwork location when the NC requires contrasting locations

---

## Success criteria

**Pupils can:**
- Design a geographical enquiry with a clear question and methodology
- Collect primary data using appropriate techniques
- Present data using maps, graphs, and GIS where appropriate
- Analyse findings and evaluate the reliability of conclusions

## Geographical skills (KS3)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Using maps, atlases and globes** — Locating and identifying places in the United Kingdom and wider world using world maps, atlases and globes as reference tools, understanding that these are representations of the real world at reduced scale.
- **Using compass directions and locational language** — Applying the four cardinal compass directions (North, South, East, West) and everyday directional language such as near, far, left and right to describe the location of features and routes on maps and in the environment.
- **Using aerial photographs and making simple maps** — Interpreting aerial photographs and plan-perspective images to recognise landmarks and physical and human features, and translating these observations into a simple hand-drawn map with a basic symbol key.
- **Simple fieldwork and observational skills** — Going out into the school grounds and immediate surrounding environment to observe, describe and record human and physical geographical features at first hand, practising the habits of direct geographical enquiry.
- **Using maps, atlases, globes and digital mapping** — Extending atlas and map use to locate countries and describe the features studied across the curriculum, and beginning to use digital and computer mapping tools — including online satellite maps — to access geographical information in a range of formats.
- **Eight-point compass and Ordnance Survey map skills** — Applying the eight compass points, four-figure and six-figure grid references, and the symbols and conventions of Ordnance Survey maps to build knowledge of the UK and the wider world, and to navigate and locate features on topographic maps.
