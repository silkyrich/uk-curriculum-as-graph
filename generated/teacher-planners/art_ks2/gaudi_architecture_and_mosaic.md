## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Art History: Artists, Architects and Designers (AD-KS2-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Great artists, architects and designers throughout history have developed distinctive styles and approaches that reflect the social, cultural and historical contexts of their time. At KS2, pupils learn to place significant practitioners within historical periods and begin to understand how their work has shaped art history and influenced subsequent practitioners. The explicit inclusion of architects and designers broadens pupils' understanding beyond fine art.

**Teaching guidance:** Study a diverse selection of artists, architects and designers across different historical periods, cultures and disciplines. Include both canonical and less well-known examples, and deliberately include non-Western and contemporary practitioners. Use high-quality reproductions and, where possible, visits to galleries and museums. Set projects that use specific practitioners as starting points. Teach pupils to describe, interpret and evaluate works of art using appropriate language drawn from the formal elements.

**Key vocabulary:** Renaissance, Impressionism, Modernism, movement, period, style, influence, tradition, architect, designer, sculptor, painter, historical context, cultural context

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may see art history as a list of names and dates. Connecting historical examples to pupils' own work and to contemporary practice makes history meaningful. Pupils may not appreciate non-Western art traditions; deliberately including diverse examples challenges Eurocentric assumptions. The division between fine art, craft and design can create a false hierarchy that needs to be questioned.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recalling the name and one fact about an artist, architect or designer studied in class. | Tell me one thing about the artist we have been studying. | Confusing the artists studied or mixing up their work; Not being able to recall specific details beyond the name |
| **Developing** | Describing the distinctive features of an artist's work and placing them in their historical period, explaining why their work matters. | What makes Hokusai's 'The Great Wave' distinctive? When and where was it created? | Describing only what the artwork shows without discussing technique or context; Not connecting the artwork to its historical and cultural period |
| **Expected** | Comparing artists from different times and cultures, explaining how context shapes their work, and drawing on this knowledge to inform their own creative practice. | Compare two landscape artists from different periods or cultures. How did their context influence their approach? | Listing facts about artists without making meaningful comparisons; Not connecting knowledge of artists to their own creative work |

> **Model response (Entry):** *We studied William Morris. He designed patterns with flowers and leaves for wallpaper and fabric.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Hokusai was a Japanese artist who created 'The Great Wave' around 1831. It shows a huge wave about to crash, with Mount Fuji small in the background. It is distinctive because of the dramatic composition — the wave is much bigger than the mountain — and the use of blue and white. It was a woodblock print, which meant many copies could be made. It influenced European artists when they first saw Japanese art.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Constable painted English countryside in the 1800s with realistic detail and natural light — he wanted to capture the beauty of the landscape he knew. Hockney painted the same English landscape 200 years later using bright, almost unnatural colours on an iPad. Both love the English landscape but Constable worked from nature with oils, reflecting Romantic values, while Hockney uses digital tools that reflect our technological age. In my own landscape painting, I combined realistic observation with brighter, more expressive colour — influenced by both artists.*

### Secondary concept: Creativity and Experimentation (AD-KS2-C006)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Creativity in art and design involves generating original ideas, making unexpected connections and being willing to experiment beyond familiar approaches. The KS2 curriculum explicitly requires pupils to approach their art making with creativity and experimentation, developing an increasing awareness of different kinds of art, craft and design. This concept involves taking creative risks, exploring different possibilities and developing a personal artistic voice.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Trying new approaches and accepting that not everything will work perfectly, being willing to experiment. | Refusing to try something new for fear of failure; Giving up after one attempt instead of learning from mistakes |
| **Developing** | Deliberately experimenting with techniques, materials or compositions to discover unexpected effects, building on what works. | Experimenting but not reflecting on or building on the results; Not recording experiments so they can be referred to later |
| **Expected** | Approaching creative work with genuine experimentation and risk-taking, developing personal ideas through iterative making, and reflecting critically on creative decisions. | Treating each version as a completely new piece rather than developing the same idea; Not being willing to change something that isn't working |

## Thinking lens: Perspective and Interpretation (primary)

**Key question:** Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?

**Why this lens fits:** Studying significant practitioners requires pupils to understand works from within the artist's historical context and intention, not just react aesthetically — making interpretive stance the core cognitive demand.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- Who wrote or made this, and why?
- What might they have left out?
- How does this account compare to another version of the same event?
- What experience or belief might have shaped this person's view?

**Secondary lens:** Continuity and Change Over Time — Studying great artists and designers 'throughout history' explicitly positions art knowledge as a chronological narrative where styles, techniques and ideas develop, persist or break with precedent across time.

---

## Session structure: Creative Response

### Creative Response
A creative arts or writing sequence that develops technique through exposure to exemplary work, guided exploration of techniques, structured planning, independent creation, and peer critique. Balances creative freedom with technical skill development.

`exemplar_exposure` → `technique_exploration` → `planning` → `creating` → `critique`

**Assessment:** Final creative outcome (artwork, design, written piece) accompanied by a reflective evaluation discussing techniques used, influences, and areas for development.

**Teacher note:** Use the CREATIVE RESPONSE template: share exemplar artworks or texts and guide pupils to identify specific techniques used. Provide structured opportunities to experiment with those techniques. Support planning and creating an original response that demonstrates conscious technical choices. Include time for constructive peer critique focused on the effectiveness of specific techniques.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What technique has the artist or writer used here?
- How could you use this technique in your own work?
- What choices have you made, and why?
- What feedback would help improve this piece?

## Art focus

**Artist:** Antoni Gaudi (1852-1926)
**Art movement:** Art Nouveau
**Medium:** mixed_media, collage
**Techniques:** mosaic making, paper cutting, colour planning, 3D surface coverage
**Visual elements:** colour, pattern, form, texture
**Cultural context:** Spanish/Catalan

---

## Why this study matters

Gaudi's buildings in Barcelona (Sagrada Familia, Park Guell, Casa Batllo) are visually extraordinary and teach that architecture can be as creative as painting or sculpture. His trencadis mosaic technique (broken tile mosaic) is achievable with paper or actual tile pieces and teaches colour theory, pattern, and the art of fitting irregular shapes together. As an architect-designer, he fulfils the NC requirement beyond artists.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Tile pieces too large for detailed work -- demonstrate how smaller pieces give more control
2. Gaps too wide between pieces -- teach that even spacing is part of the craft
3. Only using regular shapes -- Gaudi's point is that irregular, organic shapes create beauty

| Session length | 20–30 minutes |
| Worked examples | Required — Text-based. Child completes partial worked examples (fading). Not fully narrated. |
| Feedback tone | Peer Like Respectful |
| Normalize struggle | Yes |
| Example correct feedback | *You recognised that 1/2 is larger than 2/5, and used the common denominator method correctly. The visualiser confirms it — the bar for 1/2 is noticeably longer.* |
| Example error feedback | *The reasoning does not quite hold: you said both fractions are the same because the numerator in 2/5 is double the numerator in 1/2. But the denominator changed too — the pieces got smaller. Converting to tenths: 1/2 = 5/10 and 2/5 = 4/10. Which is larger now?* |
