## Concepts

This study delivers **2 primary concepts** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Painting Mastery (AD-KS2-C002)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Building on KS1 colour exploration, KS2 pupils develop greater control in mixing, applying and layering paint to achieve specific expressive and representational effects. They learn about colour theory including complementary and harmonious colours, warm and cool palettes, and how artists use colour deliberately to create mood, depth and compositional focus.

**Teaching guidance:** Explore a wider range of paints including watercolour, acrylic and poster paint. Teach colour mixing in more depth, covering warm and cool colours, complementary pairs, and how to create neutrals and earthy tones. Study how artists such as Monet, Van Gogh or Klimt used colour expressively. Teach techniques such as wet-on-wet watercolour, impasto and glazing. Encourage pupils to plan colour choices in sketchbooks before committing to final paintings.

**Key vocabulary:** complementary, harmonious, warm, cool, tint, shade, hue, intensity, wet-on-wet, impasto, glaze, wash, palette, saturated, neutral

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may believe colour mixing is unpredictable. Systematic colour mixing activities build understanding of predictable outcomes. Some pupils mix too many colours resulting in muddy browns; teaching about complementary pairs and limited palettes addresses this. Pupils may not connect colour choices to emotional or compositional intent.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Mixing secondary and tertiary colours from primaries with control, understanding the colour wheel. | Mix the colour you can see in this autumn leaf. What primary colours do you need? | Using pre-mixed colours from pots instead of mixing from primaries; Not observing the actual colour closely enough — painting from assumption |
| **Developing** | Applying paint with awareness of colour relationships (complementary, harmonious, warm, cool) and varying techniques (wash, layering, impasto). | Paint a landscape using a warm colour palette for the foreground and cool colours for the background to create depth. | Using colours randomly without considering their relationships; Applying paint the same way throughout without varying technique |
| **Expected** | Painting with control and intention, using colour, tone and brushwork to express ideas or create specific visual effects, drawing on knowledge of how artists use paint. | Paint a scene that captures a mood (e.g. a stormy sky, a peaceful garden). Explain how your colour and technique choices create the mood. | Painting a literal scene without considering mood or atmosphere; Not connecting technical choices (colour, brushwork) to expressive intentions |

> **Model response (Entry):** *I mixed red and yellow to make orange, then added a tiny bit of green to make it more brownish. The leaf has different colours in different parts so I mixed several shades of orange-brown.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *I used warm oranges, reds and yellows in the foreground to make it feel close. The background uses cool blues and greys, which recede. I applied the foreground thickly with visible brushstrokes for texture and the background as a thin wash for smoothness. The warm/cool contrast creates a sense of distance.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *I painted a stormy sky using dark greys, purples and flashes of yellow-white. I applied the paint thickly with sweeping, diagonal brushstrokes to show the wind. I blended the clouds while wet to make them look turbulent. The ground is darker and calmer, using horizontal strokes that contrast with the wild sky. I was inspired by how Turner uses thick, swirling paint to capture weather.*

### Primary concept: Art History: Artists, Architects and Designers (AD-KS2-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Great artists, architects and designers throughout history have developed distinctive styles and approaches that reflect the social, cultural and historical contexts of their time. At KS2, pupils learn to place significant practitioners within historical periods and begin to understand how their work has shaped art history and influenced subsequent practitioners. The explicit inclusion of architects and designers broadens pupils' understanding beyond fine art.

**Teaching guidance:** Study a diverse selection of artists, architects and designers across different historical periods, cultures and disciplines. Include both canonical and less well-known examples, and deliberately include non-Western and contemporary practitioners. Use high-quality reproductions and, where possible, visits to galleries and museums. Set projects that use specific practitioners as starting points. Teach pupils to describe, interpret and evaluate works of art using appropriate language drawn from the formal elements.

**Key vocabulary:** Renaissance, Impressionism, Modernism, movement, period, style, influence, tradition, architect, designer, sculptor, painter, historical context, cultural context

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may see art history as a list of names and dates. Connecting historical examples to pupils' own work and to contemporary practice makes history meaningful. Pupils may not appreciate non-Western art traditions; deliberately including diverse examples challenges Eurocentric assumptions. The division between fine art, craft and design can create a false hierarchy that needs to be questioned.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recalling the name and one fact about an artist, architect or designer studied in class. | Tell me one thing about the artist we have been studying. | Confusing the artists studied or mixing up their work; Not being able to recall specific details beyond the name |
| **Developing** | Describing the distinctive features of an artist's work and placing them in their historical period, explaining why their work matters. | What makes Hokusai's 'The Great Wave' distinctive? When and where was it created? | Describing only what the artwork shows without discussing technique or context; Not connecting the artwork to its historical and cultural period |
| **Expected** | Comparing artists from different times and cultures, explaining how context shapes their work, and drawing on this knowledge to inform their own creative practice. | Compare two landscape artists from different periods or cultures. How did their context influence their approach? | Listing facts about artists without making meaningful comparisons; Not connecting knowledge of artists to their own creative work |

> **Model response (Entry):** *We studied William Morris. He designed patterns with flowers and leaves for wallpaper and fabric.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Hokusai was a Japanese artist who created 'The Great Wave' around 1831. It shows a huge wave about to crash, with Mount Fuji small in the background. It is distinctive because of the dramatic composition — the wave is much bigger than the mountain — and the use of blue and white. It was a woodblock print, which meant many copies could be made. It influenced European artists when they first saw Japanese art.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Constable painted English countryside in the 1800s with realistic detail and natural light — he wanted to capture the beauty of the landscape he knew. Hockney painted the same English landscape 200 years later using bright, almost unnatural colours on an iPad. Both love the English landscape but Constable worked from nature with oils, reflecting Romantic values, while Hockney uses digital tools that reflect our technological age. In my own landscape painting, I combined realistic observation with brighter, more expressive colour — influenced by both artists.*

### Secondary concept: Sketchbook as Creative Tool (AD-KS2-C004)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

A sketchbook is a personal working document used by artists to record observations, collect ideas, experiment with techniques and develop thinking over time. At KS2, pupils learn to use sketchbooks as an integral part of their creative process, treating them as a living record of their developing ideas rather than a place for finished work. This concept models the iterative, exploratory nature of creative practice.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Using a sketchbook to record simple observations and ideas through drawings and notes. | Treating the sketchbook as a finished work rather than a place for exploration; Only using the sketchbook when told to rather than as a regular habit |
| **Developing** | Using a sketchbook to collect ideas, experiment with techniques, and develop thinking over time, not just record finished work. | Doing the same approach three times instead of genuinely experimenting; Not annotating experiments with reflections on what worked and what didn't |
| **Expected** | Using a sketchbook as an integral part of the creative process, developing ideas through multiple iterations, collecting references and reflecting on progress. | Jumping from first idea to final piece without development stages; Not using the sketchbook to explore alternatives and make decisions |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Mastery of drawing and painting requires understanding how specific material properties (pencil hardness, paint viscosity, brush type) determine the marks that can be made — structure directly constrains and enables expressive function.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- How does the shape or arrangement help it do its job?
- Can you find two different structures that do the same thing? How do they compare?
- If you were designing this, what would you keep and what would you change?
- Why is this material or structure better suited than another?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — The sketchbook functions as a record of visual evidence — observations, experiments, annotations — from which ideas are developed and justified; pupils learn to use their own recorded evidence to make and support creative decisions.

## Session structure: Creative Response

### Creative Response
A creative arts or writing sequence that develops technique through exposure to exemplary work, guided exploration of techniques, structured planning, independent creation, and peer critique. Balances creative freedom with technical skill development.

`exemplar_exposure` → `technique_exploration` → `planning` → `creating` → `critique`

**Assessment:** Final creative outcome (artwork, design, written piece) accompanied by a reflective evaluation discussing techniques used, influences, and areas for development.

**Teacher note:** Use the CREATIVE RESPONSE template: share exemplar artworks or texts and guide pupils to identify specific techniques used. Provide structured opportunities to experiment with those techniques. Support planning and creating an original response that demonstrates conscious technical choices. Include time for constructive peer critique focused on the effectiveness of specific techniques.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What technique has the artist or writer used here?
- How could you use this technique in your own work?
- What choices have you made, and why?
- What feedback would help improve this piece?

## Art focus

**Artist:** Claude Monet (1840-1926)
**Art movement:** Impressionism
**Medium:** paint
**Techniques:** Impressionist brushwork, colour mixing, wet-on-wet, observational painting, layering
**Visual elements:** colour, tone, texture, space
**Cultural context:** French/European

---

## Why this study matters

Monet's work is the ideal vehicle for teaching colour mixing at an advanced level. His water lilies and haystacks show the same subject in different light conditions, teaching that colour is not fixed -- it changes with time of day, weather, and season. Impressionist brushwork (visible, varied, directional) gives pupils permission to move beyond flat colour-filling to expressive mark-making with paint.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils try to blend colours smoothly -- Impressionism keeps colours separate and lets the eye mix them
2. Painting from photographs rather than real observation -- take pupils outside if possible
3. Only mixing on the palette -- teach mixing on the canvas through layering
