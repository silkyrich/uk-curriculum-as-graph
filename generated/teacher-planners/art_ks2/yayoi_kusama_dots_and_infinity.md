## Concepts

This study delivers **2 primary concepts** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Art History: Artists, Architects and Designers (AD-KS2-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Great artists, architects and designers throughout history have developed distinctive styles and approaches that reflect the social, cultural and historical contexts of their time. At KS2, pupils learn to place significant practitioners within historical periods and begin to understand how their work has shaped art history and influenced subsequent practitioners. The explicit inclusion of architects and designers broadens pupils' understanding beyond fine art.

**Teaching guidance:** Study a diverse selection of artists, architects and designers across different historical periods, cultures and disciplines. Include both canonical and less well-known examples, and deliberately include non-Western and contemporary practitioners. Use high-quality reproductions and, where possible, visits to galleries and museums. Set projects that use specific practitioners as starting points. Teach pupils to describe, interpret and evaluate works of art using appropriate language drawn from the formal elements.

**Key vocabulary:** Renaissance, Impressionism, Modernism, movement, period, style, influence, tradition, architect, designer, sculptor, painter, historical context, cultural context

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may see art history as a list of names and dates. Connecting historical examples to pupils' own work and to contemporary practice makes history meaningful. Pupils may not appreciate non-Western art traditions; deliberately including diverse examples challenges Eurocentric assumptions. The division between fine art, craft and design can create a false hierarchy that needs to be questioned.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recalling the name and one fact about an artist, architect or designer studied in class. | Tell me one thing about the artist we have been studying. | Confusing the artists studied or mixing up their work; Not being able to recall specific details beyond the name |
| **Developing** | Describing the distinctive features of an artist's work and placing them in their historical period, explaining why their work matters. | What makes Hokusai's 'The Great Wave' distinctive? When and where was it created? | Describing only what the artwork shows without discussing technique or context; Not connecting the artwork to its historical and cultural period |
| **Expected** | Comparing artists from different times and cultures, explaining how context shapes their work, and drawing on this knowledge to inform their own creative practice. | Compare two landscape artists from different periods or cultures. How did their context influence their approach? | Listing facts about artists without making meaningful comparisons; Not connecting knowledge of artists to their own creative work |

> **Model response (Entry):** *We studied William Morris. He designed patterns with flowers and leaves for wallpaper and fabric.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Hokusai was a Japanese artist who created 'The Great Wave' around 1831. It shows a huge wave about to crash, with Mount Fuji small in the background. It is distinctive because of the dramatic composition — the wave is much bigger than the mountain — and the use of blue and white. It was a woodblock print, which meant many copies could be made. It influenced European artists when they first saw Japanese art.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Constable painted English countryside in the 1800s with realistic detail and natural light — he wanted to capture the beauty of the landscape he knew. Hockney painted the same English landscape 200 years later using bright, almost unnatural colours on an iPad. Both love the English landscape but Constable worked from nature with oils, reflecting Romantic values, while Hockney uses digital tools that reflect our technological age. In my own landscape painting, I combined realistic observation with brighter, more expressive colour — influenced by both artists.*

### Primary concept: Creativity and Experimentation (AD-KS2-C006)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Creativity in art and design involves generating original ideas, making unexpected connections and being willing to experiment beyond familiar approaches. The KS2 curriculum explicitly requires pupils to approach their art making with creativity and experimentation, developing an increasing awareness of different kinds of art, craft and design. This concept involves taking creative risks, exploring different possibilities and developing a personal artistic voice.

**Teaching guidance:** Set open-ended creative briefs that allow diverse responses. Reward risk-taking and unusual approaches. Use warm-up activities that free pupils from concern about outcomes. Teach techniques for generating ideas such as mind-mapping, collage, random juxtapositions and working from imagination as well as observation. Discuss how famous artists experimented throughout their careers and how their work evolved.

**Key vocabulary:** experiment, explore, original, creative, invent, imagination, risk, develop, combine, transform, investigate, unconventional, personal style

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may equate creativity with natural talent and believe it cannot be developed. Teaching that creativity involves learnable strategies and habits of mind addresses this. Some pupils may need explicit permission to make unusual choices or to depart from conventional approaches. Evaluation of creative risk-taking should reward the process of exploration, not only the quality of final outcomes.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Trying new approaches and accepting that not everything will work perfectly, being willing to experiment. | Try a technique you haven't used before. It's okay if it doesn't turn out perfectly — what did you learn? | Refusing to try something new for fear of failure; Giving up after one attempt instead of learning from mistakes |
| **Developing** | Deliberately experimenting with techniques, materials or compositions to discover unexpected effects, building on what works. | Experiment with three different ways of applying paint to paper. Which creates the most interesting effect? | Experimenting but not reflecting on or building on the results; Not recording experiments so they can be referred to later |
| **Expected** | Approaching creative work with genuine experimentation and risk-taking, developing personal ideas through iterative making, and reflecting critically on creative decisions. | Develop a piece of artwork through at least three iterations, changing something significant each time based on what you learn. | Treating each version as a completely new piece rather than developing the same idea; Not being willing to change something that isn't working |

> **Model response (Entry):** *I tried printmaking with a polystyrene tile. My first print was messy because I used too much ink. I learned that a thin, even layer of ink works better. The second print was much clearer.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *I tried splattering, dragging with a palette knife, and blowing through a straw. Splattering created random spots. The palette knife made thick, textured stripes. Blowing through a straw made branching patterns like tree roots. I liked the straw technique best and will use it in my final piece for the tree background.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Version 1: I painted a cityscape but the buildings looked flat and lifeless. Version 2: I added collaged newspaper text to the buildings, giving them texture and a sense of the city's busy life. This was more interesting but the sky was empty. Version 3: I added a dramatic sky using wax resist, creating rain streaks. The combination of painting, collage and wax resist gives the piece energy that a single technique couldn't achieve. Each version taught me something that improved the next.*

### Secondary concept: Painting Mastery (AD-KS2-C002)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Building on KS1 colour exploration, KS2 pupils develop greater control in mixing, applying and layering paint to achieve specific expressive and representational effects. They learn about colour theory including complementary and harmonious colours, warm and cool palettes, and how artists use colour deliberately to create mood, depth and compositional focus.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Mixing secondary and tertiary colours from primaries with control, understanding the colour wheel. | Using pre-mixed colours from pots instead of mixing from primaries; Not observing the actual colour closely enough — painting from assumption |
| **Developing** | Applying paint with awareness of colour relationships (complementary, harmonious, warm, cool) and varying techniques (wash, layering, impasto). | Using colours randomly without considering their relationships; Applying paint the same way throughout without varying technique |
| **Expected** | Painting with control and intention, using colour, tone and brushwork to express ideas or create specific visual effects, drawing on knowledge of how artists use paint. | Painting a literal scene without considering mood or atmosphere; Not connecting technical choices (colour, brushwork) to expressive intentions |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Mastery of drawing and painting requires understanding how specific material properties (pencil hardness, paint viscosity, brush type) determine the marks that can be made — structure directly constrains and enables expressive function.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- How does the shape or arrangement help it do its job?
- Can you find two different structures that do the same thing? How do they compare?
- If you were designing this, what would you keep and what would you change?
- Why is this material or structure better suited than another?

**Secondary lens:** Perspective and Interpretation — Studying significant practitioners requires pupils to understand works from within the artist's historical context and intention, not just react aesthetically — making interpretive stance the core cognitive demand.

## Session structure: Creative Response

### Creative Response
A creative arts or writing sequence that develops technique through exposure to exemplary work, guided exploration of techniques, structured planning, independent creation, and peer critique. Balances creative freedom with technical skill development.

`exemplar_exposure` → `technique_exploration` → `planning` → `creating` → `critique`

**Assessment:** Final creative outcome (artwork, design, written piece) accompanied by a reflective evaluation discussing techniques used, influences, and areas for development.

**Teacher note:** Use the CREATIVE RESPONSE template: share exemplar artworks or texts and guide pupils to identify specific techniques used. Provide structured opportunities to experiment with those techniques. Support planning and creating an original response that demonstrates conscious technical choices. Include time for constructive peer critique focused on the effectiveness of specific techniques.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What technique has the artist or writer used here?
- How could you use this technique in your own work?
- What choices have you made, and why?
- What feedback would help improve this piece?

## Art focus

**Artist:** Yayoi Kusama (1929-present)
**Art movement:** Contemporary/Pop Art
**Medium:** paint, mixed_media
**Techniques:** pattern making, large-scale painting, 3D surface coverage, installation planning
**Visual elements:** pattern, colour, space, form
**Cultural context:** Japanese/International

---

## Why this study matters

Kusama's polka dot installations and infinity rooms are visually striking and immediately engaging for children. Her work teaches pattern and repetition at large scale, and the concept of installation art (art that fills a space). Covering 3D objects with dots creates a whole-class immersive environment. As a contemporary Japanese female artist, she diversifies the typical artist canon.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Random dot placement rather than deliberate pattern -- study how Kusama varies dot size and density
2. Using only one colour -- Kusama uses bold complementary pairs
3. Treating it as just sticking dots -- the conceptual idea of infinity and obsession matters
