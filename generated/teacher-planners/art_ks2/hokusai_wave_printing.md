## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Art History: Artists, Architects and Designers (AD-KS2-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Great artists, architects and designers throughout history have developed distinctive styles and approaches that reflect the social, cultural and historical contexts of their time. At KS2, pupils learn to place significant practitioners within historical periods and begin to understand how their work has shaped art history and influenced subsequent practitioners. The explicit inclusion of architects and designers broadens pupils' understanding beyond fine art.

**Teaching guidance:** Study a diverse selection of artists, architects and designers across different historical periods, cultures and disciplines. Include both canonical and less well-known examples, and deliberately include non-Western and contemporary practitioners. Use high-quality reproductions and, where possible, visits to galleries and museums. Set projects that use specific practitioners as starting points. Teach pupils to describe, interpret and evaluate works of art using appropriate language drawn from the formal elements.

**Key vocabulary:** Renaissance, Impressionism, Modernism, movement, period, style, influence, tradition, architect, designer, sculptor, painter, historical context, cultural context

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may see art history as a list of names and dates. Connecting historical examples to pupils' own work and to contemporary practice makes history meaningful. Pupils may not appreciate non-Western art traditions; deliberately including diverse examples challenges Eurocentric assumptions. The division between fine art, craft and design can create a false hierarchy that needs to be questioned.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recalling the name and one fact about an artist, architect or designer studied in class. | Tell me one thing about the artist we have been studying. | Confusing the artists studied or mixing up their work; Not being able to recall specific details beyond the name |
| **Developing** | Describing the distinctive features of an artist's work and placing them in their historical period, explaining why their work matters. | What makes Hokusai's 'The Great Wave' distinctive? When and where was it created? | Describing only what the artwork shows without discussing technique or context; Not connecting the artwork to its historical and cultural period |
| **Expected** | Comparing artists from different times and cultures, explaining how context shapes their work, and drawing on this knowledge to inform their own creative practice. | Compare two landscape artists from different periods or cultures. How did their context influence their approach? | Listing facts about artists without making meaningful comparisons; Not connecting knowledge of artists to their own creative work |

> **Model response (Entry):** *We studied William Morris. He designed patterns with flowers and leaves for wallpaper and fabric.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Hokusai was a Japanese artist who created 'The Great Wave' around 1831. It shows a huge wave about to crash, with Mount Fuji small in the background. It is distinctive because of the dramatic composition — the wave is much bigger than the mountain — and the use of blue and white. It was a woodblock print, which meant many copies could be made. It influenced European artists when they first saw Japanese art.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Constable painted English countryside in the 1800s with realistic detail and natural light — he wanted to capture the beauty of the landscape he knew. Hockney painted the same English landscape 200 years later using bright, almost unnatural colours on an iPad. Both love the English landscape but Constable worked from nature with oils, reflecting Romantic values, while Hockney uses digital tools that reflect our technological age. In my own landscape painting, I combined realistic observation with brighter, more expressive colour — influenced by both artists.*

### Secondary concept: Drawing Mastery (AD-KS2-C001)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

At KS2, drawing develops from exploratory mark-making to more controlled, purposeful and technically sophisticated work. Pupils learn to use a wider range of drawing tools and to vary line quality, tone and mark-making techniques to achieve different effects, including observational drawing and drawing from imagination. The concept of mastery implies deliberate practice, critical self-evaluation and progressive improvement over time.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Drawing from observation using pencil with some attention to proportion and detail. | Drawing from memory or imagination rather than looking at the object; Starting with small details instead of the overall shape |
| **Developing** | Using a range of drawing techniques (hatching, cross-hatching, stippling, blending) to create tone and texture in observational drawings. | Applying the same tone everywhere instead of observing light and shadow; Using only one shading technique throughout |
| **Expected** | Creating observational drawings that demonstrate control of line, tone, proportion and texture, using drawing tools and techniques selected for their specific qualities. | Choosing a drawing medium without considering how its qualities match the subject; Not varying the level of detail to create visual interest and focus |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Mastery of drawing and painting requires understanding how specific material properties (pencil hardness, paint viscosity, brush type) determine the marks that can be made — structure directly constrains and enables expressive function.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- How does the shape or arrangement help it do its job?
- Can you find two different structures that do the same thing? How do they compare?
- If you were designing this, what would you keep and what would you change?
- Why is this material or structure better suited than another?

**Secondary lens:** Perspective and Interpretation — Studying significant practitioners requires pupils to understand works from within the artist's historical context and intention, not just react aesthetically — making interpretive stance the core cognitive demand.

---

## Session structure: Creative Response

### Creative Response
A creative arts or writing sequence that develops technique through exposure to exemplary work, guided exploration of techniques, structured planning, independent creation, and peer critique. Balances creative freedom with technical skill development.

`exemplar_exposure` → `technique_exploration` → `planning` → `creating` → `critique`

**Assessment:** Final creative outcome (artwork, design, written piece) accompanied by a reflective evaluation discussing techniques used, influences, and areas for development.

**Teacher note:** Use the CREATIVE RESPONSE template: share exemplar artworks or texts and guide pupils to identify specific techniques used. Provide structured opportunities to experiment with those techniques. Support planning and creating an original response that demonstrates conscious technical choices. Include time for constructive peer critique focused on the effectiveness of specific techniques.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What technique has the artist or writer used here?
- How could you use this technique in your own work?
- What choices have you made, and why?
- What feedback would help improve this piece?

## Art focus

**Artist:** Katsushika Hokusai (1760-1849)
**Art movement:** Ukiyo-e
**Medium:** print
**Techniques:** block printing, colour layering, design transfer, polystyrene tile cutting
**Visual elements:** line, pattern, shape, form
**Cultural context:** Japanese

---

## Why this study matters

Hokusai's Great Wave is one of the most recognisable images in art history. The wave's bold lines and dramatic composition translate well to printmaking at Y3-Y4 level. Block printing requires planning (design must be reversed), precision (cutting technique), and sequencing (ink, press, pull) -- all transferable skills. The Japanese cultural context supports Geography and History cross-curricular work.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Forgetting to reverse the design -- the print will be a mirror image of the block
2. Using too much ink -- press should be even, not flooded
3. Rushing the cutting -- safety first with lino cutters or polystyrene tiles, adult supervision essential
