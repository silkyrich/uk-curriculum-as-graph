## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Art History: Artists, Architects and Designers (AD-KS2-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Great artists, architects and designers throughout history have developed distinctive styles and approaches that reflect the social, cultural and historical contexts of their time. At KS2, pupils learn to place significant practitioners within historical periods and begin to understand how their work has shaped art history and influenced subsequent practitioners. The explicit inclusion of architects and designers broadens pupils' understanding beyond fine art.

**Teaching guidance:** Study a diverse selection of artists, architects and designers across different historical periods, cultures and disciplines. Include both canonical and less well-known examples, and deliberately include non-Western and contemporary practitioners. Use high-quality reproductions and, where possible, visits to galleries and museums. Set projects that use specific practitioners as starting points. Teach pupils to describe, interpret and evaluate works of art using appropriate language drawn from the formal elements.

**Key vocabulary:** Renaissance, Impressionism, Modernism, movement, period, style, influence, tradition, architect, designer, sculptor, painter, historical context, cultural context

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may see art history as a list of names and dates. Connecting historical examples to pupils' own work and to contemporary practice makes history meaningful. Pupils may not appreciate non-Western art traditions; deliberately including diverse examples challenges Eurocentric assumptions. The division between fine art, craft and design can create a false hierarchy that needs to be questioned.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recalling the name and one fact about an artist, architect or designer studied in class. | Tell me one thing about the artist we have been studying. | Confusing the artists studied or mixing up their work; Not being able to recall specific details beyond the name |
| **Developing** | Describing the distinctive features of an artist's work and placing them in their historical period, explaining why their work matters. | What makes Hokusai's 'The Great Wave' distinctive? When and where was it created? | Describing only what the artwork shows without discussing technique or context; Not connecting the artwork to its historical and cultural period |
| **Expected** | Comparing artists from different times and cultures, explaining how context shapes their work, and drawing on this knowledge to inform their own creative practice. | Compare two landscape artists from different periods or cultures. How did their context influence their approach? | Listing facts about artists without making meaningful comparisons; Not connecting knowledge of artists to their own creative work |

> **Model response (Entry):** *We studied William Morris. He designed patterns with flowers and leaves for wallpaper and fabric.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Hokusai was a Japanese artist who created 'The Great Wave' around 1831. It shows a huge wave about to crash, with Mount Fuji small in the background. It is distinctive because of the dramatic composition — the wave is much bigger than the mountain — and the use of blue and white. It was a woodblock print, which meant many copies could be made. It influenced European artists when they first saw Japanese art.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Constable painted English countryside in the 1800s with realistic detail and natural light — he wanted to capture the beauty of the landscape he knew. Hockney painted the same English landscape 200 years later using bright, almost unnatural colours on an iPad. Both love the English landscape but Constable worked from nature with oils, reflecting Romantic values, while Hockney uses digital tools that reflect our technological age. In my own landscape painting, I combined realistic observation with brighter, more expressive colour — influenced by both artists.*

### Secondary concept: Drawing Mastery (AD-KS2-C001)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

At KS2, drawing develops from exploratory mark-making to more controlled, purposeful and technically sophisticated work. Pupils learn to use a wider range of drawing tools and to vary line quality, tone and mark-making techniques to achieve different effects, including observational drawing and drawing from imagination. The concept of mastery implies deliberate practice, critical self-evaluation and progressive improvement over time.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Drawing from observation using pencil with some attention to proportion and detail. | Drawing from memory or imagination rather than looking at the object; Starting with small details instead of the overall shape |
| **Developing** | Using a range of drawing techniques (hatching, cross-hatching, stippling, blending) to create tone and texture in observational drawings. | Applying the same tone everywhere instead of observing light and shadow; Using only one shading technique throughout |
| **Expected** | Creating observational drawings that demonstrate control of line, tone, proportion and texture, using drawing tools and techniques selected for their specific qualities. | Choosing a drawing medium without considering how its qualities match the subject; Not varying the level of detail to create visual interest and focus |

### Secondary concept: Painting Mastery (AD-KS2-C002)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Building on KS1 colour exploration, KS2 pupils develop greater control in mixing, applying and layering paint to achieve specific expressive and representational effects. They learn about colour theory including complementary and harmonious colours, warm and cool palettes, and how artists use colour deliberately to create mood, depth and compositional focus.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Mixing secondary and tertiary colours from primaries with control, understanding the colour wheel. | Using pre-mixed colours from pots instead of mixing from primaries; Not observing the actual colour closely enough — painting from assumption |
| **Developing** | Applying paint with awareness of colour relationships (complementary, harmonious, warm, cool) and varying techniques (wash, layering, impasto). | Using colours randomly without considering their relationships; Applying paint the same way throughout without varying technique |
| **Expected** | Painting with control and intention, using colour, tone and brushwork to express ideas or create specific visual effects, drawing on knowledge of how artists use paint. | Painting a literal scene without considering mood or atmosphere; Not connecting technical choices (colour, brushwork) to expressive intentions |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Mastery of drawing and painting requires understanding how specific material properties (pencil hardness, paint viscosity, brush type) determine the marks that can be made — structure directly constrains and enables expressive function.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- How does the shape or arrangement help it do its job?
- Can you find two different structures that do the same thing? How do they compare?
- If you were designing this, what would you keep and what would you change?
- Why is this material or structure better suited than another?

**Secondary lens:** Perspective and Interpretation — Studying significant practitioners requires pupils to understand works from within the artist's historical context and intention, not just react aesthetically — making interpretive stance the core cognitive demand.

## Session structure: Creative Response

### Creative Response
A creative arts or writing sequence that develops technique through exposure to exemplary work, guided exploration of techniques, structured planning, independent creation, and peer critique. Balances creative freedom with technical skill development.

`exemplar_exposure` → `technique_exploration` → `planning` → `creating` → `critique`

**Assessment:** Final creative outcome (artwork, design, written piece) accompanied by a reflective evaluation discussing techniques used, influences, and areas for development.

**Teacher note:** Use the CREATIVE RESPONSE template: share exemplar artworks or texts and guide pupils to identify specific techniques used. Provide structured opportunities to experiment with those techniques. Support planning and creating an original response that demonstrates conscious technical choices. Include time for constructive peer critique focused on the effectiveness of specific techniques.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What technique has the artist or writer used here?
- How could you use this technique in your own work?
- What choices have you made, and why?
- What feedback would help improve this piece?

## Art focus

**Artist:** L.S. Lowry (1887-1976)
**Art movement:** British Realism
**Medium:** paint
**Techniques:** colour mixing (muted tones), perspective drawing, figure drawing, compositional planning
**Visual elements:** colour, space, form, tone
**Cultural context:** British

---

## Why this study matters

Lowry's industrial scenes provide an accessible entry to perspective and composition. His matchstick figures are deceptively simple but teach proportion, movement, and the relationship between figure and setting. The muted colour palette (greys, whites, pale blues) teaches colour mixing beyond bright primaries. The social context of industrial Lancashire connects powerfully to History.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils draw figures as stick men rather than Lowry's distinctive elongated forms -- study his figures closely first
2. Background buildings all the same height -- teach how Lowry varied scale to create depth
3. Colour mixing defaults to dark grey -- demonstrate the range of warm and cool greys Lowry used
