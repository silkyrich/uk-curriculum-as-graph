## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Sculpture Mastery (AD-KS2-C003)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

At KS2, pupils develop greater technical control and creative ambition in three-dimensional work. They learn to use materials such as clay, wire, card and found objects with increasing skill, understanding how structural decisions affect the stability, form and visual impact of a sculpture. Pupils also develop awareness of how sculptors work across a range of traditions and purposes.

**Teaching guidance:** Build on KS1 clay work with more complex techniques such as coil building, slab construction and surface decoration. Use wire armatures to support larger-scale figures or abstract forms. Explore mixed-media sculpture combining multiple materials. Study a range of sculptors from different cultures and periods. Encourage pupils to plan three-dimensional work through sketches and maquettes before making final pieces.

**Key vocabulary:** sculpture, three-dimensional, relief, armature, coil, slab, pinch, carve, assemble, texture, form, space, maquette, installation

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may focus on surface decoration at the expense of structural integrity. Teaching basic structural principles prevents this. Some pupils may not see sculpture as a legitimate mode of artistic expression compared to drawing and painting; a rich diet of sculptural examples challenges this. Planning in 2D before working in 3D is a skill that requires explicit modelling.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Using materials such as clay, wire or card to create simple three-dimensional forms with basic control. | Make a simple clay pot using the coil or pinch technique. | Making the walls too thin so the pot collapses; Not turning the piece while working, so it becomes lopsided |
| **Developing** | Planning and constructing three-dimensional work with awareness of form, surface treatment and structural integrity. | Design and make a clay vessel inspired by Greek pottery. Plan the form and decoration before starting. | Not planning the form before building, resulting in structural problems; Adding decoration without considering how it relates to the overall form |
| **Expected** | Creating sculptures that demonstrate technical skill, creative thinking and awareness of how form, material and surface interact to create meaning. | Create a sculpture that communicates an idea or emotion. Explain your material and design choices. | Focusing on technical execution without connecting to an idea or intention; Not considering how the choice of material contributes to the meaning |

> **Model response (Entry):** *I started with a ball of clay and used my thumb to push a hole in the middle. I pinched the walls up and outward, turning the pot as I went, making the walls an even thickness.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *I sketched the amphora shape first — narrow base, wide body, narrow neck with two handles. I used coils to build up the walls, smoothing each layer. I added handles by scoring and slipping coil pieces. Before firing, I carved a geometric pattern around the widest part, inspired by Greek key patterns.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *I made a wire and tissue paper sculpture of a bird in flight to represent freedom. The wire armature gives the structure and the tissue paper stretched over the wings lets light through, suggesting lightness. The wings are spread wide and angled upward. I chose wire because it can be bent into flowing curves, and tissue because it is fragile and translucent — the opposite of heavy, which supports the idea of freedom and flight.*

### Secondary concept: Art History: Artists, Architects and Designers (AD-KS2-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Great artists, architects and designers throughout history have developed distinctive styles and approaches that reflect the social, cultural and historical contexts of their time. At KS2, pupils learn to place significant practitioners within historical periods and begin to understand how their work has shaped art history and influenced subsequent practitioners. The explicit inclusion of architects and designers broadens pupils' understanding beyond fine art.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recalling the name and one fact about an artist, architect or designer studied in class. | Confusing the artists studied or mixing up their work; Not being able to recall specific details beyond the name |
| **Developing** | Describing the distinctive features of an artist's work and placing them in their historical period, explaining why their work matters. | Describing only what the artwork shows without discussing technique or context; Not connecting the artwork to its historical and cultural period |
| **Expected** | Comparing artists from different times and cultures, explaining how context shapes their work, and drawing on this knowledge to inform their own creative practice. | Listing facts about artists without making meaningful comparisons; Not connecting knowledge of artists to their own creative work |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Mastery of drawing and painting requires understanding how specific material properties (pencil hardness, paint viscosity, brush type) determine the marks that can be made — structure directly constrains and enables expressive function.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- How does the shape or arrangement help it do its job?
- Can you find two different structures that do the same thing? How do they compare?
- If you were designing this, what would you keep and what would you change?
- Why is this material or structure better suited than another?

**Secondary lens:** Perspective and Interpretation — Studying significant practitioners requires pupils to understand works from within the artist's historical context and intention, not just react aesthetically — making interpretive stance the core cognitive demand.

---

## Session structure: Creative Response

### Creative Response
A creative arts or writing sequence that develops technique through exposure to exemplary work, guided exploration of techniques, structured planning, independent creation, and peer critique. Balances creative freedom with technical skill development.

`exemplar_exposure` → `technique_exploration` → `planning` → `creating` → `critique`

**Assessment:** Final creative outcome (artwork, design, written piece) accompanied by a reflective evaluation discussing techniques used, influences, and areas for development.

**Teacher note:** Use the CREATIVE RESPONSE template: share exemplar artworks or texts and guide pupils to identify specific techniques used. Provide structured opportunities to experiment with those techniques. Support planning and creating an original response that demonstrates conscious technical choices. Include time for constructive peer critique focused on the effectiveness of specific techniques.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What technique has the artist or writer used here?
- How could you use this technique in your own work?
- What choices have you made, and why?
- What feedback would help improve this piece?

## Art focus

**Medium:** clay
**Techniques:** coil building, slab construction, scoring and slipping, surface decoration, restricted palette painting
**Visual elements:** form, pattern, line, shape
**Cultural context:** Ancient Greek

## Why this study matters

Greek pottery is the classic cross-curricular Art-History project. Building coil pots teaches slab and coil techniques more advanced than KS1 pinch pots. Painting with a restricted palette (black on terracotta, or terracotta on black) teaches discipline and control. The narrative scenes on Greek pots connect to mythology and storytelling.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Coils not blended properly -- pot cracks along the joins when drying
2. Surface decoration attempted before the pot is leather-hard -- paint runs on wet clay
3. Figure painting too detailed for the scale -- study Greek figure conventions (profile faces, frontal bodies)
