## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Drawing Mastery (AD-KS2-C001)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

At KS2, drawing develops from exploratory mark-making to more controlled, purposeful and technically sophisticated work. Pupils learn to use a wider range of drawing tools and to vary line quality, tone and mark-making techniques to achieve different effects, including observational drawing and drawing from imagination. The concept of mastery implies deliberate practice, critical self-evaluation and progressive improvement over time.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce pencil grading (H to B) and demonstrate how different pressures and angles create different marks. Teach shading techniques including hatching, cross-hatching and blending. Set regular observational drawing tasks from natural objects, still life and the environment. Use charcoal for tonal work and bold expressive drawing. Encourage pupils to compare drawings over time and identify areas of improvement. Connect drawing to sketchbook practice as a way of developing ideas.

**Key vocabulary:** tone, shade, gradient, hatching, cross-hatching, contour, proportion, perspective, observation, detail, composition, charcoal, graphite, tonal range

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may equate drawing mastery with photographic accuracy rather than expressive control. Teaching that great artists develop personal styles reinforces that mastery is about intentional choices. Some pupils give up if their first attempt does not match expectation; scaffolding with structured practice builds resilience and the understanding that skill is developed over time.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Drawing from observation using pencil with some attention to proportion and detail. | Draw this shoe from observation. Look carefully at the shape and proportions before you start. | Drawing from memory or imagination rather than looking at the object; Starting with small details instead of the overall shape |
| **Developing** | Using a range of drawing techniques (hatching, cross-hatching, stippling, blending) to create tone and texture in observational drawings. | Draw this crumpled piece of fabric. Use shading techniques to show the folds, shadows and highlights. | Applying the same tone everywhere instead of observing light and shadow; Using only one shading technique throughout |
| **Expected** | Creating observational drawings that demonstrate control of line, tone, proportion and texture, using drawing tools and techniques selected for their specific qualities. | Create a detailed study of a natural object (feather, shell, leaf) using the drawing medium that best captures its qualities. | Choosing a drawing medium without considering how its qualities match the subject; Not varying the level of detail to create visual interest and focus |

> **Model response (Entry):** *I looked at the overall shape first and drew it lightly. The sole is wider than the top. I added the laces, the stitching line and the brand logo. I used light lines first and then made the final lines darker.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *I used cross-hatching in the deep folds where the shadows are darkest. For the medium tones, I used lighter hatching. I left the highlights as white paper. I used blending with my finger where the fabric curves gently. The shading shows which parts are raised and which are folded under.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *I chose charcoal for a feather because the softness of charcoal matches the softness of the feather. I drew the central quill with a sharp edge and the barbs with light, sweeping strokes. I used an eraser to lift highlights where the feather catches light. The tip is detailed and the base becomes softer and more blurred, drawing the eye along the form.*

### Secondary concept: Sketchbook as Creative Tool (AD-KS2-C004)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

A sketchbook is a personal working document used by artists to record observations, collect ideas, experiment with techniques and develop thinking over time. At KS2, pupils learn to use sketchbooks as an integral part of their creative process, treating them as a living record of their developing ideas rather than a place for finished work. This concept models the iterative, exploratory nature of creative practice.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Using a sketchbook to record simple observations and ideas through drawings and notes. | Treating the sketchbook as a finished work rather than a place for exploration; Only using the sketchbook when told to rather than as a regular habit |
| **Developing** | Using a sketchbook to collect ideas, experiment with techniques, and develop thinking over time, not just record finished work. | Doing the same approach three times instead of genuinely experimenting; Not annotating experiments with reflections on what worked and what didn't |
| **Expected** | Using a sketchbook as an integral part of the creative process, developing ideas through multiple iterations, collecting references and reflecting on progress. | Jumping from first idea to final piece without development stages; Not using the sketchbook to explore alternatives and make decisions |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Mastery of drawing and painting requires understanding how specific material properties (pencil hardness, paint viscosity, brush type) determine the marks that can be made — structure directly constrains and enables expressive function.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- How does the shape or arrangement help it do its job?
- Can you find two different structures that do the same thing? How do they compare?
- If you were designing this, what would you keep and what would you change?
- Why is this material or structure better suited than another?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — The sketchbook functions as a record of visual evidence — observations, experiments, annotations — from which ideas are developed and justified; pupils learn to use their own recorded evidence to make and support creative decisions.

## Session structure: Creative Response

### Creative Response
A creative arts or writing sequence that develops technique through exposure to exemplary work, guided exploration of techniques, structured planning, independent creation, and peer critique. Balances creative freedom with technical skill development.

`exemplar_exposure` → `technique_exploration` → `planning` → `creating` → `critique`

**Assessment:** Final creative outcome (artwork, design, written piece) accompanied by a reflective evaluation discussing techniques used, influences, and areas for development.

**Teacher note:** Use the CREATIVE RESPONSE template: share exemplar artworks or texts and guide pupils to identify specific techniques used. Provide structured opportunities to experiment with those techniques. Support planning and creating an original response that demonstrates conscious technical choices. Include time for constructive peer critique focused on the effectiveness of specific techniques.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What technique has the artist or writer used here?
- How could you use this technique in your own work?
- What choices have you made, and why?
- What feedback would help improve this piece?

## Why this study matters

Charcoal is the ideal medium for teaching tonal range because it can produce everything from the lightest grey to the deepest black. Landscape drawing in charcoal develops observation of light and shadow, foreground-background relationships, and atmospheric perspective. The bold, physical nature of charcoal encourages expressive mark-making that pencil sometimes inhibits.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pressing too hard throughout -- teach light pressure for pale tones, heavy for dark
2. Smudging unintentionally -- teach the 'bridge' hand position and use of fixative spray
3. Not using the eraser as a drawing tool -- pulling out highlights creates form
