## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Drawing Mastery (AD-KS2-C001)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

At KS2, drawing develops from exploratory mark-making to more controlled, purposeful and technically sophisticated work. Pupils learn to use a wider range of drawing tools and to vary line quality, tone and mark-making techniques to achieve different effects, including observational drawing and drawing from imagination. The concept of mastery implies deliberate practice, critical self-evaluation and progressive improvement over time.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce pencil grading (H to B) and demonstrate how different pressures and angles create different marks. Teach shading techniques including hatching, cross-hatching and blending. Set regular observational drawing tasks from natural objects, still life and the environment. Use charcoal for tonal work and bold expressive drawing. Encourage pupils to compare drawings over time and identify areas of improvement. Connect drawing to sketchbook practice as a way of developing ideas.

**Key vocabulary:** tone, shade, gradient, hatching, cross-hatching, contour, proportion, perspective, observation, detail, composition, charcoal, graphite, tonal range

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may equate drawing mastery with photographic accuracy rather than expressive control. Teaching that great artists develop personal styles reinforces that mastery is about intentional choices. Some pupils give up if their first attempt does not match expectation; scaffolding with structured practice builds resilience and the understanding that skill is developed over time.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Drawing from observation using pencil with some attention to proportion and detail. | Draw this shoe from observation. Look carefully at the shape and proportions before you start. | Drawing from memory or imagination rather than looking at the object; Starting with small details instead of the overall shape |
| **Developing** | Using a range of drawing techniques (hatching, cross-hatching, stippling, blending) to create tone and texture in observational drawings. | Draw this crumpled piece of fabric. Use shading techniques to show the folds, shadows and highlights. | Applying the same tone everywhere instead of observing light and shadow; Using only one shading technique throughout |
| **Expected** | Creating observational drawings that demonstrate control of line, tone, proportion and texture, using drawing tools and techniques selected for their specific qualities. | Create a detailed study of a natural object (feather, shell, leaf) using the drawing medium that best captures its qualities. | Choosing a drawing medium without considering how its qualities match the subject; Not varying the level of detail to create visual interest and focus |

> **Model response (Entry):** *I looked at the overall shape first and drew it lightly. The sole is wider than the top. I added the laces, the stitching line and the brand logo. I used light lines first and then made the final lines darker.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *I used cross-hatching in the deep folds where the shadows are darkest. For the medium tones, I used lighter hatching. I left the highlights as white paper. I used blending with my finger where the fabric curves gently. The shading shows which parts are raised and which are folded under.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *I chose charcoal for a feather because the softness of charcoal matches the softness of the feather. I drew the central quill with a sharp edge and the barbs with light, sweeping strokes. I used an eraser to lift highlights where the feather catches light. The tip is detailed and the base becomes softer and more blurred, drawing the eye along the form.*

### Secondary concept: Sketchbook as Creative Tool (AD-KS2-C004)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

A sketchbook is a personal working document used by artists to record observations, collect ideas, experiment with techniques and develop thinking over time. At KS2, pupils learn to use sketchbooks as an integral part of their creative process, treating them as a living record of their developing ideas rather than a place for finished work. This concept models the iterative, exploratory nature of creative practice.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Using a sketchbook to record simple observations and ideas through drawings and notes. | Treating the sketchbook as a finished work rather than a place for exploration; Only using the sketchbook when told to rather than as a regular habit |
| **Developing** | Using a sketchbook to collect ideas, experiment with techniques, and develop thinking over time, not just record finished work. | Doing the same approach three times instead of genuinely experimenting; Not annotating experiments with reflections on what worked and what didn't |
| **Expected** | Using a sketchbook as an integral part of the creative process, developing ideas through multiple iterations, collecting references and reflecting on progress. | Jumping from first idea to final piece without development stages; Not using the sketchbook to explore alternatives and make decisions |

### Secondary concept: Art History: Artists, Architects and Designers (AD-KS2-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Great artists, architects and designers throughout history have developed distinctive styles and approaches that reflect the social, cultural and historical contexts of their time. At KS2, pupils learn to place significant practitioners within historical periods and begin to understand how their work has shaped art history and influenced subsequent practitioners. The explicit inclusion of architects and designers broadens pupils' understanding beyond fine art.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recalling the name and one fact about an artist, architect or designer studied in class. | Confusing the artists studied or mixing up their work; Not being able to recall specific details beyond the name |
| **Developing** | Describing the distinctive features of an artist's work and placing them in their historical period, explaining why their work matters. | Describing only what the artwork shows without discussing technique or context; Not connecting the artwork to its historical and cultural period |
| **Expected** | Comparing artists from different times and cultures, explaining how context shapes their work, and drawing on this knowledge to inform their own creative practice. | Listing facts about artists without making meaningful comparisons; Not connecting knowledge of artists to their own creative work |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Mastery of drawing and painting requires understanding how specific material properties (pencil hardness, paint viscosity, brush type) determine the marks that can be made — structure directly constrains and enables expressive function.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- How does the shape or arrangement help it do its job?
- Can you find two different structures that do the same thing? How do they compare?
- If you were designing this, what would you keep and what would you change?
- Why is this material or structure better suited than another?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — The sketchbook functions as a record of visual evidence — observations, experiments, annotations — from which ideas are developed and justified; pupils learn to use their own recorded evidence to make and support creative decisions.

## Session structure: Observation Over Time

### Observation Over Time
Systematic observation and recording of changes or patterns over an extended period. Pupils make careful observations, record findings using drawings, measurements, or logs, classify what they observe, and identify patterns or trends. Particularly suited to biological processes and artistic study of the natural world.

`observation` → `recording` → `classifying` → `pattern_identification`

**Assessment:** Observation log or journal with dated entries, annotated drawings or measurements, classification of observations, and summary identifying the key patterns or changes observed.

**Teacher note:** Use the OBSERVATION OVER TIME template: set up a systematic observation that pupils record at regular intervals. Introduce simple recording techniques such as labelled diagrams, data tables, or photographs. Guide pupils to compare observations across time points, describe changes using scientific vocabulary, and identify any patterns in what they observe.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What will you observe, and how often will you record it?
- How has it changed since the last observation?
- Can you spot a pattern in how it has changed over time?
- What do you think caused the changes you observed?

## Art focus

**Medium:** drawing
**Techniques:** ruler use, perspective drawing, observational drawing, annotation, shading
**Visual elements:** line, shape, space, form

---

## Why this study matters

Drawing buildings introduces perspective, proportion, and the use of rulers and straight edges in Art. It connects to the NC requirement to learn about architects and designers as well as artists. Local building studies take pupils into their environment and develop observation skills. The progression from simple front elevations to one-point perspective drawings develops spatial reasoning.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. All lines freehand when rulers would give better results -- teach when to use drawing aids
2. Ignoring windows and doors as proportional elements -- count them, measure them
3. Not drawing from real buildings -- go outside or use photographs of the school and local area
