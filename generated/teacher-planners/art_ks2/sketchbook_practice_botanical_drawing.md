## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Sketchbook as Creative Tool (AD-KS2-C004)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

A sketchbook is a personal working document used by artists to record observations, collect ideas, experiment with techniques and develop thinking over time. At KS2, pupils learn to use sketchbooks as an integral part of their creative process, treating them as a living record of their developing ideas rather than a place for finished work. This concept models the iterative, exploratory nature of creative practice.

**Teaching guidance:** Give each pupil their own sketchbook and establish a culture where it is used regularly throughout the year. Encourage pupils to fill pages with quick sketches, notes, material samples and test marks as well as more developed studies. Set specific sketchbook tasks such as observational drawings, colour experiments and responses to works of art. Teach pupils to annotate their sketchbooks with reflections. Treat sketchbooks as evidence of creative thinking and reward exploration rather than only finished quality.

**Key vocabulary:** observation, record, annotate, develop, revisit, experiment, plan, research, collect, reflect, process, iteration, working drawing, visual diary

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often treat sketchbooks as finished work books, producing neat drawings on blank pages. The idea that messy, exploratory work is valuable needs explicit modelling by teachers. Some pupils may not see the connection between sketchbook work and final outcomes; structured links between exploration and making phases are essential.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Using a sketchbook to record simple observations and ideas through drawings and notes. | In your sketchbook, draw three objects from the classroom. Write a note about what interests you about each one. | Treating the sketchbook as a finished work rather than a place for exploration; Only using the sketchbook when told to rather than as a regular habit |
| **Developing** | Using a sketchbook to collect ideas, experiment with techniques, and develop thinking over time, not just record finished work. | Use your sketchbook to explore three different approaches to drawing a tree. Try different media and techniques. | Doing the same approach three times instead of genuinely experimenting; Not annotating experiments with reflections on what worked and what didn't |
| **Expected** | Using a sketchbook as an integral part of the creative process, developing ideas through multiple iterations, collecting references and reflecting on progress. | Use your sketchbook to develop a design for a final piece. Show at least three stages of development from initial idea to final plan. | Jumping from first idea to final piece without development stages; Not using the sketchbook to explore alternatives and make decisions |

> **Model response (Entry):** *I drew the plant, the clock and my pencil case. The plant has interesting leaf shapes. The clock has a round face with numbers. My pencil case has a zip pattern that would make a good drawing subject.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *First I drew a tree in pencil with careful observation of the bark texture. Then I tried the same tree in charcoal, focusing on the overall shape and shadows. Third, I drew just the leaves using coloured pencil to explore the range of greens. Each approach showed me something different about the tree.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Page 1: Initial idea sketches — five quick thumbnails of different compositions. Page 2: Research — I stuck in a photograph of the landscape and colour swatches from artists who painted similar scenes. Page 3: I developed my preferred composition larger, trying different colour palettes alongside. Page 4: Final plan with annotations showing exactly which colours, techniques and materials I will use. The sketchbook shows how my idea changed from a simple idea to a thought-through plan.*

### Secondary concept: Drawing Mastery (AD-KS2-C001)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

At KS2, drawing develops from exploratory mark-making to more controlled, purposeful and technically sophisticated work. Pupils learn to use a wider range of drawing tools and to vary line quality, tone and mark-making techniques to achieve different effects, including observational drawing and drawing from imagination. The concept of mastery implies deliberate practice, critical self-evaluation and progressive improvement over time.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Drawing from observation using pencil with some attention to proportion and detail. | Drawing from memory or imagination rather than looking at the object; Starting with small details instead of the overall shape |
| **Developing** | Using a range of drawing techniques (hatching, cross-hatching, stippling, blending) to create tone and texture in observational drawings. | Applying the same tone everywhere instead of observing light and shadow; Using only one shading technique throughout |
| **Expected** | Creating observational drawings that demonstrate control of line, tone, proportion and texture, using drawing tools and techniques selected for their specific qualities. | Choosing a drawing medium without considering how its qualities match the subject; Not varying the level of detail to create visual interest and focus |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Mastery of drawing and painting requires understanding how specific material properties (pencil hardness, paint viscosity, brush type) determine the marks that can be made — structure directly constrains and enables expressive function.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- How does the shape or arrangement help it do its job?
- Can you find two different structures that do the same thing? How do they compare?
- If you were designing this, what would you keep and what would you change?
- Why is this material or structure better suited than another?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — The sketchbook functions as a record of visual evidence — observations, experiments, annotations — from which ideas are developed and justified; pupils learn to use their own recorded evidence to make and support creative decisions.

## Session structure: Observation Over Time

### Observation Over Time
Systematic observation and recording of changes or patterns over an extended period. Pupils make careful observations, record findings using drawings, measurements, or logs, classify what they observe, and identify patterns or trends. Particularly suited to biological processes and artistic study of the natural world.

`observation` → `recording` → `classifying` → `pattern_identification`

**Assessment:** Observation log or journal with dated entries, annotated drawings or measurements, classification of observations, and summary identifying the key patterns or changes observed.

**Teacher note:** Use the OBSERVATION OVER TIME template: set up a systematic observation that pupils record at regular intervals. Introduce simple recording techniques such as labelled diagrams, data tables, or photographs. Guide pupils to compare observations across time points, describe changes using scientific vocabulary, and identify any patterns in what they observe.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What will you observe, and how often will you record it?
- How has it changed since the last observation?
- Can you spot a pattern in how it has changed over time?
- What do you think caused the changes you observed?

## Why this study matters

Botanical drawing is the perfect vehicle for introducing sustained sketchbook practice. Plants do not move, offer infinite variety of form and detail, and connect directly to science. Pupils learn to use the sketchbook as a working document -- quick studies, annotated observations, colour notes, and detailed drawings all belong. The tradition of botanical illustration (from Renaissance herbals to Kew Gardens) gives historical context.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils draw symbolic flowers (five petals, green stem) rather than observing real specimens -- always draw from life
2. Sketchbook treated as a 'best work' book -- model messy, experimental pages
3. Only using pencil -- introduce coloured pencil, watercolour wash, and ink in the sketchbook
