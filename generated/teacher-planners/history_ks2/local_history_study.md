## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **3 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Historical Evidence and Interpretation (HI-KS2-C003)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Historians construct interpretations of the past from the evidence that survives. Evidence includes primary sources (created at the time) and secondary sources (created after the fact), each with distinctive strengths and limitations. Historians also interpret the same evidence differently based on their questions, frameworks and perspectives, which is why different historical accounts of the same events can reach different conclusions. At KS2, pupils develop the ability to work with and evaluate a range of historical sources, and to understand that historical knowledge is constructed through the interpretation of evidence rather than simply discovered.

**Teaching guidance:** Develop a systematic approach to source analysis: provenance (who, when, why), content (what does it say/show), utility (what can we learn from it) and reliability (how trustworthy is it and why). Compare sources that offer different perspectives on the same event. Discuss why sources can be biased or incomplete without being worthless. Help pupils understand that all historical accounts, including their textbooks, are interpretations. Use 'big question' enquiries that require pupils to evaluate evidence and construct argued responses.

**Key vocabulary:** source, evidence, primary, secondary, provenance, reliable, biased, perspective, interpretation, evaluate, corroborate, account, historian, partial, incomplete

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may believe that written sources are more reliable than other types. Discussing how photographs can be staged, letters can be biased and accounts can be selective challenges this. The concept that a biased source is not necessarily useless requires explicit teaching: a source biased in a particular direction still tells us something about its author's perspective. Pupils may not understand why different historians reach different conclusions; discussing different perspectives and frameworks helps.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying whether a source is from the time being studied (primary) or created later (secondary), and stating one thing the source tells us. | This is a Roman coin found in Britain. Is it a primary source or a secondary source? What does it tell us? | Confusing primary and secondary sources; Describing the physical appearance of the source without saying what it tells us about the past |
| **Developing** | Asking questions about who created a source, when and why, and considering what it can and cannot tell us. | Here is an account of a battle written by the winning side. What questions should we ask about this source? What might it not tell us? | Accepting the source at face value without questioning its origin or purpose; Dismissing a biased source as useless rather than recognising what it still reveals |
| **Expected** | Comparing two or more sources about the same event, identifying where they agree and disagree, and explaining why different interpretations exist. | Here are two accounts of the Viking attack on Lindisfarne: one from a Saxon monk and one from a modern historian. How do they differ and why? | Assuming the modern account must be correct and the older one wrong; Not explaining why the differences exist, only listing them |
| **Greater Depth** | Evaluating the reliability and utility of sources for answering specific historical questions, and understanding that interpretation changes as new evidence emerges. | A historian in 1950 wrote that the Anglo-Saxons were simple farmers. New archaeological evidence suggests they were skilled metalworkers and traders. What does this tell us about how history is written? | Thinking historical facts never change, rather than understanding that interpretations evolve; Assuming that newer interpretations are always better without considering the evidence |

> **Model response (Entry):** *It is a primary source because it was made by the Romans. It tells us the Romans used coins with pictures of their emperors on them.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *We should ask: who wrote it and were they there? Why did they write it? It might not tell us what the losing side experienced. The writer probably wanted to make their side look good, so it might exaggerate their bravery.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *The Saxon monk describes the Vikings as terrible savages sent by God as punishment. The modern historian explains the attack as part of Viking expansion driven by trade and settlement. They differ because the monk was there and was terrified, while the historian has more evidence and is looking at the bigger picture. Neither is completely right or wrong — they have different perspectives.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *It tells us that historical interpretations change when new evidence is found. The 1950 historian only had limited evidence, so their interpretation was based on what they knew. Archaeology has revealed things written sources didn't mention. This means we should treat all historical accounts as 'the best interpretation so far' rather than final truth.*

### Secondary concept: Cause and Consequence (HI-KS2-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Historical causation involves understanding why events happened - identifying the factors that made an event or change more or less likely, and explaining how those factors combined to produce historical outcomes. Consequence refers to the effects of events or changes - what happened as a result, both immediately and over longer periods. At KS2, pupils develop the ability to identify multiple causes and consequences for historical events, understanding that history is driven by the complex interaction of political, economic, social, religious and individual factors rather than single causes.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying a single cause or consequence of a historical event when given options or prompts. | Selecting an answer without being able to explain why it makes sense; Confusing cause (why something happened) with consequence (what happened as a result) |
| **Developing** | Describing more than one cause or consequence of a historical event and beginning to distinguish between short-term and long-term effects. | Listing causes without distinguishing their relative importance; Describing only immediate consequences and missing longer-term effects |
| **Expected** | Explaining how multiple causes combined to produce a historical event, and distinguishing between intended and unintended consequences. | Treating causes as a simple list rather than explaining how they interact; Assuming every consequence was intended by the historical actors |
| **Greater Depth** | Evaluating the relative importance of different causes, arguing which was most significant and supporting the argument with evidence. | Stating a cause is 'most important' without providing evidence or reasoning; Refusing to prioritise causes and insisting all were equally important without analysis |

### Secondary concept: Significance (HI-KS2-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Historical significance refers to the importance of a person, event or development in history, assessed by criteria such as the scale and duration of its impact, how many people were affected, whether it changed the course of events, whether people at the time thought it important, and how it is remembered and commemorated. Significance is not fixed: what seems significant from one perspective or in one time period may appear less so from another. At KS2, pupils begin to develop explicit criteria for judging historical significance and apply them to the people and events they study.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recalling why a person or event studied in class is considered important in history. | Confusing 'remembered' with 'significant' — something can be remembered but not important; Giving a circular answer: 'It is important because it is famous' |
| **Developing** | Using at least two criteria to explain why a historical event, person or development is significant. | Applying criteria mechanically without connecting them to specific evidence; Only using one criterion when asked for multiple |
| **Expected** | Explaining that significance can change over time or be viewed differently by different groups, using specific historical examples. | Treating significance as a fixed, objective fact rather than something that can be debated; Only considering the perspective of the 'winners' in a historical event |
| **Greater Depth** | Constructing an argument about which of several events or individuals was most historically significant, applying criteria systematically and considering counter-arguments. | Making an assertion without supporting it with historical evidence; Not acknowledging that the other side of the argument has merit |

### Secondary concept: British Historical Periods: Prehistoric to Medieval (HI-KS2-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Britain's history from the Stone Age to the Norman Conquest encompasses several distinct periods, each marked by major social, technological and political changes: Prehistoric Britain (Stone, Bronze and Iron Ages); Roman Britain (43-410 AD); Anglo-Saxon Britain (410-1066 AD); and Viking Age Britain (793-1066 AD). Each period represents a distinct phase in the long history of human habitation and society on the British Isles, with different peoples, technologies, political systems, religious beliefs and cultural practices. Understanding these periods gives pupils a foundation in British heritage and the capacity to recognise the long-range development of the society they live in.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Placing the main British historical periods studied (Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Vikings, Normans) in the correct chronological order. | Placing Vikings before Anglo-Saxons (they overlapped but Anglo-Saxon settlement came first); Confusing the order of Romans and Iron Age peoples |
| **Developing** | Describing the distinctive characteristics of each period and explaining what changed between one period and the next. | Describing periods in isolation without explaining what changed between them; Portraying earlier periods as purely primitive without recognising their sophistication |
| **Expected** | Explaining connections between periods, showing how developments in one period built on, reacted to, or were influenced by the previous period. | Treating periods as completely separate with no connections; Assuming the Romans left suddenly and everything changed overnight |
| **Greater Depth** | Using evidence to evaluate different historical interpretations of a period, and recognising that periodisation itself is a historical construction. | Accepting period labels uncritically without questioning who created them and why; Equating fewer surviving sources with less historical importance |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Each successive wave of change (Roman invasion, Anglo-Saxon migration, Viking raids, Norman Conquest) requires pupils to ask what caused it and what consequences followed, practising causal reasoning at an accessible narrative scale.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- What caused this to happen?
- How could we check if that is the reason?
- Is there more than one reason?
- What would happen if we changed just one thing?

**Secondary lens:** Continuity and Change Over Time — The sweep from Stone Age to Norman Conquest is explicitly a study in long-run change and continuity — pupils must trace what shifted (tools, religion, political organisation, language) and what persisted across prehistoric, Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods, building a chronological framework for later study.

## Session structure: Topic Study + Source Enquiry

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Topic Study (main structure)
A structured enquiry into a defined topic, period, or place. Begins with an engaging hook to capture interest, builds contextual knowledge, moves through source analysis and interpretation, and culminates in a substantiated argument or conclusion. The core humanities template.

`hook` → `context` → `source_analysis` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Extended writing task presenting a reasoned argument supported by evidence from the topic. Can take the form of an essay, structured explanation, or debate position.

**Teacher note:** Use the TOPIC STUDY template: open with an engaging hook that raises a question or challenge. Build context using a timeline or key facts. Introduce 2-3 sources for pupils to analyse, prompting them to consider who made each source and why. Guide pupils toward forming their own interpretation, supported by evidence from the sources.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What does this source tell us, and what does it leave out?
- Who created this source, and why might that matter?
- Do these two sources agree or disagree? How can you tell?
- What is your interpretation, and what evidence supports it?

### Source Enquiry
A disciplinary history enquiry centred on working with primary and secondary sources. Pupils select relevant sources, contextualise them within their historical period, interrogate them for reliability, utility, and bias, cross-reference between sources, interpret what they reveal, and construct an argument based on the evidence.

`source_selection` → `contextualisation` → `interrogation` → `cross_referencing` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Source-based extended writing that demonstrates ability to analyse provenance, cross-reference sources, reach substantiated interpretations, and construct a historical argument.

**Teacher note:** Use the SOURCE ENQUIRY template: present 2-3 carefully selected historical sources with clear context about when and why each was made. Guide pupils to describe what each source shows, consider who created it and why, and begin to cross-reference sources. Support them in forming an interpretation based on the evidence.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What does this source tell us?
- Who made this source, and why might that affect what it says?
- Do these sources agree with each other?
- What is your interpretation, and which source supports it best?

## Disciplinary concepts foregrounded

| Concept | Key question | Role in this study |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Evidence and Interpretation | How do we know about this, and how do historians disagree? | At KS2, use local primary sources (census records, old maps, photographs, artefacts) to conduct genuine historical enquiry. |
| Change and Continuity | What changed, what stayed the same, and why? | At KS2, compare the local area across time periods: what has changed and what has stayed the same? |
| Significance | Why does this matter, and to whom? | At KS2, evaluate which local person, event or place is most historically significant and justify using criteria. |

---

## Why this study matters

Local history makes the abstract concrete by connecting historical concepts to places pupils know. It provides the most accessible route to primary sources (census records, old maps, local museum artefacts) and develops skills of historical enquiry in a personally meaningful context.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Choosing a topic too broad (entire history of the town) rather than a specific aspect or period
2. Relying solely on secondary sources when local primary sources are often readily available
3. Failing to connect the local study to the broader national narrative

## Sensitive content

- Local history may uncover difficult aspects including poverty, industrial exploitation or displacement
- Oral history from community elders may raise sensitive personal or family memories

## Cross-curricular opportunities

| Link | Subject | Connection | Strength |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| Geographical Skills and Fieldwork | Geography | Map skills: comparing old and new OS maps of the local area | Strong |
| Report Writing: Non-Chronological Reports | English | Writing a local history guide; conducting and recording oral history interviews | Strong |

## Historical thinking skills (KS2)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Chronological understanding** — Understand and use chronological frameworks to sequence events, periods and changes over time; develop a chronologically secure knowledge of British, local and world history using historical time vocabulary with increasing precision; construct and interpret timelines that place events in meaningful relation to each other.
- **Causation and consequence** — Understand why historical events and changes happened by identifying and explaining multiple causes; assess the intended and unintended consequences of events and decisions; distinguish between long-term structural factors and immediate triggers; construct causal arguments using historical evidence.
- **Change and continuity** — Identify what changed and what remained constant across historical periods; assess the pace, nature and extent of change; distinguish between long-term trends and short-term fluctuations; understand that change can be experienced differently by different groups within the same society.
- **Similarity and difference** — Identify and explain similarities and differences within and across historical periods, societies and cultures; avoid anachronism by understanding people's lives and choices within their own contexts; make valid comparisons that illuminate both the distinctiveness of periods and the common threads of human experience.
- **Historical significance** — Assess the significance of historical events, people and developments using explicit criteria such as scale of impact, duration, number of people affected, degree of change caused, and how an event is remembered and commemorated; understand that significance is not fixed but is constructed and contested by historians and societies over time.
- **Historical evidence** — Locate, select and use a range of primary and secondary historical sources; understand provenance and evaluate a source's utility and reliability in relation to a specific enquiry; corroborate claims across multiple sources; recognise that all sources are partial and that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
