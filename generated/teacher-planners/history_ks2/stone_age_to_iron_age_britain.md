This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **3 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: British Historical Periods: Prehistoric to Medieval (HI-KS2-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Britain's history from the Stone Age to the Norman Conquest encompasses several distinct periods, each marked by major social, technological and political changes: Prehistoric Britain (Stone, Bronze and Iron Ages); Roman Britain (43-410 AD); Anglo-Saxon Britain (410-1066 AD); and Viking Age Britain (793-1066 AD). Each period represents a distinct phase in the long history of human habitation and society on the British Isles, with different peoples, technologies, political systems, religious beliefs and cultural practices. Understanding these periods gives pupils a foundation in British heritage and the capacity to recognise the long-range development of the society they live in.

**Teaching guidance:** Establish a clear chronological framework for the periods studied: use a timeline that runs from prehistoric times to 1066 and place each topic on it. Study each period in sufficient depth to understand its distinctive character, not just its sequence. Connect periods: how did the Roman occupation affect the Anglo-Saxon period? What did the Vikings find when they arrived? Use artefacts, reconstructions and archaeological evidence alongside textual sources. Connect to local history: are there local Roman roads, Anglo-Saxon place names, Viking settlements?

**Key vocabulary:** prehistoric, Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, Roman, Anglo-Saxon, Viking, Norman, invasion, settlement, tribe, kingdom, conquest, legacy, chronology, period

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may see the historical periods as completely separate rather than as phases in a continuous story. Emphasising connections between periods - the Roman influence on Anglo-Saxon culture, the Viking influence on English - develops more integrated understanding. Pupils may have a romantic rather than realistic view of the Viking or Anglo-Saxon periods; a balanced approach using archaeological and textual evidence avoids both romanticisation and demonisation.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Placing the main British historical periods studied (Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Vikings, Normans) in the correct chronological order. | Put these periods in order from earliest to latest: Vikings, Romans, Stone Age, Anglo-Saxons. | Placing Vikings before Anglo-Saxons (they overlapped but Anglo-Saxon settlement came first); Confusing the order of Romans and Iron Age peoples |
| **Developing** | Describing the distinctive characteristics of each period and explaining what changed between one period and the next. | What was different about life in Roman Britain compared with life in the Iron Age? | Describing periods in isolation without explaining what changed between them; Portraying earlier periods as purely primitive without recognising their sophistication |
| **Expected** | Explaining connections between periods, showing how developments in one period built on, reacted to, or were influenced by the previous period. | How did the end of Roman rule in Britain lead to the Anglo-Saxon period? What connections can you find between the two? | Treating periods as completely separate with no connections; Assuming the Romans left suddenly and everything changed overnight |
| **Greater Depth** | Using evidence to evaluate different historical interpretations of a period, and recognising that periodisation itself is a historical construction. | Historians sometimes call the period after the Romans left Britain the 'Dark Ages'. Do you think this is a fair name? What evidence supports or challenges it? | Accepting period labels uncritically without questioning who created them and why; Equating fewer surviving sources with less historical importance |

> **Model response (Entry):** *Stone Age, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Vikings.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *In the Iron Age, people lived in round houses in small settlements and tribes often fought each other. The Romans brought towns with stone buildings, straight roads connecting them, public baths, and a single system of laws. People started using Roman coins and some learned Latin.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *When the Romans left around 410 AD, Britain lost its centralised government, army and trade connections. Towns declined and the road system wasn't maintained. This created a power vacuum that the Anglo-Saxons filled, establishing their own kingdoms. However, some Roman influences continued — Christianity, which the Romans had brought, survived and later converted the Anglo-Saxons.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *The term 'Dark Ages' suggests nothing good happened, but this isn't fair. Anglo-Saxon England produced beautiful metalwork like the Sutton Hoo treasure, complex poetry like Beowulf, and established kingdoms with sophisticated law codes. It's called 'dark' partly because fewer written records survive, so we know less — but that doesn't mean the period was less advanced. The name reflects our lack of evidence more than the quality of the period.*

### Secondary concept: Cause and Consequence (HI-KS2-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Historical causation involves understanding why events happened - identifying the factors that made an event or change more or less likely, and explaining how those factors combined to produce historical outcomes. Consequence refers to the effects of events or changes - what happened as a result, both immediately and over longer periods. At KS2, pupils develop the ability to identify multiple causes and consequences for historical events, understanding that history is driven by the complex interaction of political, economic, social, religious and individual factors rather than single causes.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying a single cause or consequence of a historical event when given options or prompts. | Selecting an answer without being able to explain why it makes sense; Confusing cause (why something happened) with consequence (what happened as a result) |
| **Developing** | Describing more than one cause or consequence of a historical event and beginning to distinguish between short-term and long-term effects. | Listing causes without distinguishing their relative importance; Describing only immediate consequences and missing longer-term effects |
| **Expected** | Explaining how multiple causes combined to produce a historical event, and distinguishing between intended and unintended consequences. | Treating causes as a simple list rather than explaining how they interact; Assuming every consequence was intended by the historical actors |
| **Greater Depth** | Evaluating the relative importance of different causes, arguing which was most significant and supporting the argument with evidence. | Stating a cause is 'most important' without providing evidence or reasoning; Refusing to prioritise causes and insisting all were equally important without analysis |

### Secondary concept: Significance (HI-KS2-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Historical significance refers to the importance of a person, event or development in history, assessed by criteria such as the scale and duration of its impact, how many people were affected, whether it changed the course of events, whether people at the time thought it important, and how it is remembered and commemorated. Significance is not fixed: what seems significant from one perspective or in one time period may appear less so from another. At KS2, pupils begin to develop explicit criteria for judging historical significance and apply them to the people and events they study.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recalling why a person or event studied in class is considered important in history. | Confusing 'remembered' with 'significant' — something can be remembered but not important; Giving a circular answer: 'It is important because it is famous' |
| **Developing** | Using at least two criteria to explain why a historical event, person or development is significant. | Applying criteria mechanically without connecting them to specific evidence; Only using one criterion when asked for multiple |
| **Expected** | Explaining that significance can change over time or be viewed differently by different groups, using specific historical examples. | Treating significance as a fixed, objective fact rather than something that can be debated; Only considering the perspective of the 'winners' in a historical event |
| **Greater Depth** | Constructing an argument about which of several events or individuals was most historically significant, applying criteria systematically and considering counter-arguments. | Making an assertion without supporting it with historical evidence; Not acknowledging that the other side of the argument has merit |

### Secondary concept: Historical Evidence and Interpretation (HI-KS2-C003)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Historians construct interpretations of the past from the evidence that survives. Evidence includes primary sources (created at the time) and secondary sources (created after the fact), each with distinctive strengths and limitations. Historians also interpret the same evidence differently based on their questions, frameworks and perspectives, which is why different historical accounts of the same events can reach different conclusions. At KS2, pupils develop the ability to work with and evaluate a range of historical sources, and to understand that historical knowledge is constructed through the interpretation of evidence rather than simply discovered.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying whether a source is from the time being studied (primary) or created later (secondary), and stating one thing the source tells us. | Confusing primary and secondary sources; Describing the physical appearance of the source without saying what it tells us about the past |
| **Developing** | Asking questions about who created a source, when and why, and considering what it can and cannot tell us. | Accepting the source at face value without questioning its origin or purpose; Dismissing a biased source as useless rather than recognising what it still reveals |
| **Expected** | Comparing two or more sources about the same event, identifying where they agree and disagree, and explaining why different interpretations exist. | Assuming the modern account must be correct and the older one wrong; Not explaining why the differences exist, only listing them |
| **Greater Depth** | Evaluating the reliability and utility of sources for answering specific historical questions, and understanding that interpretation changes as new evidence emerges. | Thinking historical facts never change, rather than understanding that interpretations evolve; Assuming that newer interpretations are always better without considering the evidence |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Each successive wave of change (Roman invasion, Anglo-Saxon migration, Viking raids, Norman Conquest) requires pupils to ask what caused it and what consequences followed, practising causal reasoning at an accessible narrative scale.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- What caused this to happen?
- How could we check if that is the reason?
- Is there more than one reason?
- What would happen if we changed just one thing?

**Secondary lens:** Continuity and Change Over Time — The sweep from Stone Age to Norman Conquest is explicitly a study in long-run change and continuity — pupils must trace what shifted (tools, religion, political organisation, language) and what persisted across prehistoric, Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods, building a chronological framework for later study.

## Session structure: Topic Study

### Topic Study
A structured enquiry into a defined topic, period, or place. Begins with an engaging hook to capture interest, builds contextual knowledge, moves through source analysis and interpretation, and culminates in a substantiated argument or conclusion. The core humanities template.

`hook` → `context` → `source_analysis` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Extended writing task presenting a reasoned argument supported by evidence from the topic. Can take the form of an essay, structured explanation, or debate position.

**Teacher note:** Use the TOPIC STUDY template: open with an engaging hook that raises a question or challenge. Build context using a timeline or key facts. Introduce 2-3 sources for pupils to analyse, prompting them to consider who made each source and why. Guide pupils toward forming their own interpretation, supported by evidence from the sources.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What does this source tell us, and what does it leave out?
- Who created this source, and why might that matter?
- Do these two sources agree or disagree? How can you tell?
- What is your interpretation, and what evidence supports it?

## Primary sources

Three historically grounded source types are available for this study:

### 1. Skara Brae Settlement Remains (Primary Archaeological, )
A Neolithic settlement on Mainland, Orkney, Scotland. Preserved under sand dunes for thousands of years until exposed by a storm in 1850. The settlement contains eight stone houses connected by covered passages, complete with stone furniture (beds, dressers, hearths). It is the best-preserved Neolithic village in northern Europe.

**How to use:** Show photographs of the interior of a Skara Brae house. Ask: 'What can you see? What does this tell us about how Stone Age people lived?' Then: 'What can this settlement NOT tell us? (What they believed, what they ate, what they wore -- unless we combine it with other evidence.)' This develops understanding that archaeological evidence requires inference.

**Location:** Orkney, Scotland (Historic Environment Scotland)
**URL:** https://www.historicenvironment.scot/visit-a-place/places/skara-brae/

### 2. Stonehenge (Built Heritage, )
A prehistoric monument on Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire. Built in several stages over approximately 1,000 years. The purpose remains debated: religious temple, astronomical observatory, healing site, or ceremonial gathering place. The transport of bluestones from Wales (~150 miles) demonstrates remarkable organisation and engineering.

**How to use:** Present the different theories about Stonehenge's purpose. Ask: 'How can historians disagree about something so famous?' and 'What evidence would we need to settle the debate?' This develops understanding that even iconic sources can be interpreted in different ways.

**Location:** Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire (English Heritage)
**URL:** https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/stonehenge/

### 3. Star Carr Antler Headdresses (Museum Artefact, )
Red deer antler frontlets found at Star Carr, a Mesolithic archaeological site near Scarborough, North Yorkshire. The antlers had been thinned and perforated, suggesting they were worn as headdresses. Whether they were used for hunting disguise, ritual, or both is debated.

**How to use:** Show the artefact and ask: 'What do you think this was used for? Why?' Collect pupils' ideas, then explain what archaeologists think. Ask: 'How can we decide between our ideas when the people who made this left no written record?' This models archaeological reasoning from objects.

**Location:** British Museum, London; Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, Cambridge

## Disciplinary concepts foregrounded

| Concept | Key question | Role in this study |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Chronology | When did this happen, and how does it fit into the wider timeline? | At KS2, develop a secure chronological framework: Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age. Use timelines with scale to show the vastness of this period compared with everything that follows. |
| Change and Continuity | What changed, what stayed the same, and why? | At KS2, identify the specific changes between periods (tools, settlement, farming, society) and explain what drove each change. |
| Evidence and Interpretation | How do we know about this, and how do historians disagree? | At KS2, use archaeological evidence to make inferences about people who left no written records. Ask 'What can this artefact tell us, and what CAN'T it tell us?' |
| Significance | Why does this matter, and to whom? | At KS2, evaluate the significance of the development of farming as a turning point in human history. |

## Key figures and events

**Key figures:** Cheddar Man, Otzi the Iceman

**Key events:**
- Arrival of first humans
- Development of farming c.4000 BC
- Introduction of bronze tools c.2500 BC
- Construction of Stonehenge
- Iron Age hill fort building

**Period:** c.800,000 BC - 43 AD

**Perspectives to include:** hunter-gatherer, early farmer, Bronze Age metalworker, Iron Age community member

**Significance claim:** The shift from hunter-gathering to farming was the most transformative change in human history, fundamentally altering how people lived, settled and organised their societies in Britain.

**Historiographical debate:**
- Debate over whether Stonehenge was primarily a religious site, astronomical observatory or healing centre
- Competing views on whether the transition to farming was driven by migration or adoption by indigenous populations

---

## Why this study matters

This topic provides the chronological starting point for KS2 British history and offers rich archaeological evidence for developing source skills. The vast time span (c.800,000 BC to 43 AD) is ideal for developing chronological understanding and the concept of change over long periods. The shift from hunter-gathering to farming is one of the most significant turning points in human history and gives pupils a concrete example of cause and consequence.

## Sequencing

**Leads to:** Roman Britain

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Treating the three ages as uniform blocks rather than showing internal change and regional variation within each period
2. Presenting prehistoric people as primitive or unintelligent rather than resourceful and adapted to their environment
3. Rushing through the vast timescale without helping pupils grasp the enormity of the time period involved

## Historical thinking skills (KS2)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Chronological understanding** — Understand and use chronological frameworks to sequence events, periods and changes over time; develop a chronologically secure knowledge of British, local and world history using historical time vocabulary with increasing precision; construct and interpret timelines that place events in meaningful relation to each other.
- **Causation and consequence** — Understand why historical events and changes happened by identifying and explaining multiple causes; assess the intended and unintended consequences of events and decisions; distinguish between long-term structural factors and immediate triggers; construct causal arguments using historical evidence.
- **Change and continuity** — Identify what changed and what remained constant across historical periods; assess the pace, nature and extent of change; distinguish between long-term trends and short-term fluctuations; understand that change can be experienced differently by different groups within the same society.
- **Similarity and difference** — Identify and explain similarities and differences within and across historical periods, societies and cultures; avoid anachronism by understanding people's lives and choices within their own contexts; make valid comparisons that illuminate both the distinctiveness of periods and the common threads of human experience.
- **Historical significance** — Assess the significance of historical events, people and developments using explicit criteria such as scale of impact, duration, number of people affected, degree of change caused, and how an event is remembered and commemorated; understand that significance is not fixed but is constructed and contested by historians and societies over time.
- **Historical evidence** — Locate, select and use a range of primary and secondary historical sources; understand provenance and evaluate a source's utility and reliability in relation to a specific enquiry; corroborate claims across multiple sources; recognise that all sources are partial and that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
