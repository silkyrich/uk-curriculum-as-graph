## Enquiry questions

1. Why did the Anglo-Saxons come to Britain, and what happened to the people already living here?
2. What does the Sutton Hoo burial tell us about Anglo-Saxon beliefs and society?
3. How significant was the arrival of Christianity for Anglo-Saxon England?

## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **3 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: British Historical Periods: Prehistoric to Medieval (HI-KS2-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Britain's history from the Stone Age to the Norman Conquest encompasses several distinct periods, each marked by major social, technological and political changes: Prehistoric Britain (Stone, Bronze and Iron Ages); Roman Britain (43-410 AD); Anglo-Saxon Britain (410-1066 AD); and Viking Age Britain (793-1066 AD). Each period represents a distinct phase in the long history of human habitation and society on the British Isles, with different peoples, technologies, political systems, religious beliefs and cultural practices. Understanding these periods gives pupils a foundation in British heritage and the capacity to recognise the long-range development of the society they live in.

**Teaching guidance:** Establish a clear chronological framework for the periods studied: use a timeline that runs from prehistoric times to 1066 and place each topic on it. Study each period in sufficient depth to understand its distinctive character, not just its sequence. Connect periods: how did the Roman occupation affect the Anglo-Saxon period? What did the Vikings find when they arrived? Use artefacts, reconstructions and archaeological evidence alongside textual sources. Connect to local history: are there local Roman roads, Anglo-Saxon place names, Viking settlements?

**Key vocabulary:** prehistoric, Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, Roman, Anglo-Saxon, Viking, Norman, invasion, settlement, tribe, kingdom, conquest, legacy, chronology, period

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may see the historical periods as completely separate rather than as phases in a continuous story. Emphasising connections between periods - the Roman influence on Anglo-Saxon culture, the Viking influence on English - develops more integrated understanding. Pupils may have a romantic rather than realistic view of the Viking or Anglo-Saxon periods; a balanced approach using archaeological and textual evidence avoids both romanticisation and demonisation.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Placing the main British historical periods studied (Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Vikings, Normans) in the correct chronological order. | Put these periods in order from earliest to latest: Vikings, Romans, Stone Age, Anglo-Saxons. | Placing Vikings before Anglo-Saxons (they overlapped but Anglo-Saxon settlement came first); Confusing the order of Romans and Iron Age peoples |
| **Developing** | Describing the distinctive characteristics of each period and explaining what changed between one period and the next. | What was different about life in Roman Britain compared with life in the Iron Age? | Describing periods in isolation without explaining what changed between them; Portraying earlier periods as purely primitive without recognising their sophistication |
| **Expected** | Explaining connections between periods, showing how developments in one period built on, reacted to, or were influenced by the previous period. | How did the end of Roman rule in Britain lead to the Anglo-Saxon period? What connections can you find between the two? | Treating periods as completely separate with no connections; Assuming the Romans left suddenly and everything changed overnight |
| **Greater Depth** | Using evidence to evaluate different historical interpretations of a period, and recognising that periodisation itself is a historical construction. | Historians sometimes call the period after the Romans left Britain the 'Dark Ages'. Do you think this is a fair name? What evidence supports or challenges it? | Accepting period labels uncritically without questioning who created them and why; Equating fewer surviving sources with less historical importance |

> **Model response (Entry):** *Stone Age, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Vikings.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *In the Iron Age, people lived in round houses in small settlements and tribes often fought each other. The Romans brought towns with stone buildings, straight roads connecting them, public baths, and a single system of laws. People started using Roman coins and some learned Latin.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *When the Romans left around 410 AD, Britain lost its centralised government, army and trade connections. Towns declined and the road system wasn't maintained. This created a power vacuum that the Anglo-Saxons filled, establishing their own kingdoms. However, some Roman influences continued — Christianity, which the Romans had brought, survived and later converted the Anglo-Saxons.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *The term 'Dark Ages' suggests nothing good happened, but this isn't fair. Anglo-Saxon England produced beautiful metalwork like the Sutton Hoo treasure, complex poetry like Beowulf, and established kingdoms with sophisticated law codes. It's called 'dark' partly because fewer written records survive, so we know less — but that doesn't mean the period was less advanced. The name reflects our lack of evidence more than the quality of the period.*

### Secondary concept: Cause and Consequence (HI-KS2-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Historical causation involves understanding why events happened - identifying the factors that made an event or change more or less likely, and explaining how those factors combined to produce historical outcomes. Consequence refers to the effects of events or changes - what happened as a result, both immediately and over longer periods. At KS2, pupils develop the ability to identify multiple causes and consequences for historical events, understanding that history is driven by the complex interaction of political, economic, social, religious and individual factors rather than single causes.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying a single cause or consequence of a historical event when given options or prompts. | Selecting an answer without being able to explain why it makes sense; Confusing cause (why something happened) with consequence (what happened as a result) |
| **Developing** | Describing more than one cause or consequence of a historical event and beginning to distinguish between short-term and long-term effects. | Listing causes without distinguishing their relative importance; Describing only immediate consequences and missing longer-term effects |
| **Expected** | Explaining how multiple causes combined to produce a historical event, and distinguishing between intended and unintended consequences. | Treating causes as a simple list rather than explaining how they interact; Assuming every consequence was intended by the historical actors |
| **Greater Depth** | Evaluating the relative importance of different causes, arguing which was most significant and supporting the argument with evidence. | Stating a cause is 'most important' without providing evidence or reasoning; Refusing to prioritise causes and insisting all were equally important without analysis |

### Secondary concept: Significance (HI-KS2-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Historical significance refers to the importance of a person, event or development in history, assessed by criteria such as the scale and duration of its impact, how many people were affected, whether it changed the course of events, whether people at the time thought it important, and how it is remembered and commemorated. Significance is not fixed: what seems significant from one perspective or in one time period may appear less so from another. At KS2, pupils begin to develop explicit criteria for judging historical significance and apply them to the people and events they study.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recalling why a person or event studied in class is considered important in history. | Confusing 'remembered' with 'significant' — something can be remembered but not important; Giving a circular answer: 'It is important because it is famous' |
| **Developing** | Using at least two criteria to explain why a historical event, person or development is significant. | Applying criteria mechanically without connecting them to specific evidence; Only using one criterion when asked for multiple |
| **Expected** | Explaining that significance can change over time or be viewed differently by different groups, using specific historical examples. | Treating significance as a fixed, objective fact rather than something that can be debated; Only considering the perspective of the 'winners' in a historical event |
| **Greater Depth** | Constructing an argument about which of several events or individuals was most historically significant, applying criteria systematically and considering counter-arguments. | Making an assertion without supporting it with historical evidence; Not acknowledging that the other side of the argument has merit |

### Secondary concept: Historical Evidence and Interpretation (HI-KS2-C003)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Historians construct interpretations of the past from the evidence that survives. Evidence includes primary sources (created at the time) and secondary sources (created after the fact), each with distinctive strengths and limitations. Historians also interpret the same evidence differently based on their questions, frameworks and perspectives, which is why different historical accounts of the same events can reach different conclusions. At KS2, pupils develop the ability to work with and evaluate a range of historical sources, and to understand that historical knowledge is constructed through the interpretation of evidence rather than simply discovered.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying whether a source is from the time being studied (primary) or created later (secondary), and stating one thing the source tells us. | Confusing primary and secondary sources; Describing the physical appearance of the source without saying what it tells us about the past |
| **Developing** | Asking questions about who created a source, when and why, and considering what it can and cannot tell us. | Accepting the source at face value without questioning its origin or purpose; Dismissing a biased source as useless rather than recognising what it still reveals |
| **Expected** | Comparing two or more sources about the same event, identifying where they agree and disagree, and explaining why different interpretations exist. | Assuming the modern account must be correct and the older one wrong; Not explaining why the differences exist, only listing them |
| **Greater Depth** | Evaluating the reliability and utility of sources for answering specific historical questions, and understanding that interpretation changes as new evidence emerges. | Thinking historical facts never change, rather than understanding that interpretations evolve; Assuming that newer interpretations are always better without considering the evidence |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Each successive wave of change (Roman invasion, Anglo-Saxon migration, Viking raids, Norman Conquest) requires pupils to ask what caused it and what consequences followed, practising causal reasoning at an accessible narrative scale.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- What caused this to happen?
- How could we check if that is the reason?
- Is there more than one reason?
- What would happen if we changed just one thing?

**Secondary lens:** Continuity and Change Over Time — The sweep from Stone Age to Norman Conquest is explicitly a study in long-run change and continuity — pupils must trace what shifted (tools, religion, political organisation, language) and what persisted across prehistoric, Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods, building a chronological framework for later study.

## Session structure: Topic Study + Source Enquiry

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Topic Study (main structure)
A structured enquiry into a defined topic, period, or place. Begins with an engaging hook to capture interest, builds contextual knowledge, moves through source analysis and interpretation, and culminates in a substantiated argument or conclusion. The core humanities template.

`hook` → `context` → `source_analysis` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Extended writing task presenting a reasoned argument supported by evidence from the topic. Can take the form of an essay, structured explanation, or debate position.

**Teacher note:** Use the TOPIC STUDY template: open with an engaging hook that raises a question or challenge. Build context using a timeline or key facts. Introduce 2-3 sources for pupils to analyse, prompting them to consider who made each source and why. Guide pupils toward forming their own interpretation, supported by evidence from the sources.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What does this source tell us, and what does it leave out?
- Who created this source, and why might that matter?
- Do these two sources agree or disagree? How can you tell?
- What is your interpretation, and what evidence supports it?

### Source Enquiry
A disciplinary history enquiry centred on working with primary and secondary sources. Pupils select relevant sources, contextualise them within their historical period, interrogate them for reliability, utility, and bias, cross-reference between sources, interpret what they reveal, and construct an argument based on the evidence.

`source_selection` → `contextualisation` → `interrogation` → `cross_referencing` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Source-based extended writing that demonstrates ability to analyse provenance, cross-reference sources, reach substantiated interpretations, and construct a historical argument.

**Teacher note:** Use the SOURCE ENQUIRY template: present 2-3 carefully selected historical sources with clear context about when and why each was made. Guide pupils to describe what each source shows, consider who created it and why, and begin to cross-reference sources. Support them in forming an interpretation based on the evidence.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What does this source tell us?
- Who made this source, and why might that affect what it says?
- Do these sources agree with each other?
- What is your interpretation, and which source supports it best?

## Primary sources

4 historically grounded source types are available for this study:

### 1. Sutton Hoo Ship Burial (Primary Archaeological, )
An Anglo-Saxon ship burial discovered in 1939 at Sutton Hoo, Suffolk. The burial contained a wealth of grave goods including a helmet, sword, shield, gold buckle, silver bowls and Byzantine silverware. It is believed to be the burial of King Raedwald of East Anglia. The burial demonstrates the wealth, trading connections and belief systems of Anglo-Saxon elites.

**How to use:** Show the Sutton Hoo helmet reconstruction. Ask: 'What does this tell us about the person buried here?' Build outward: 'The grave also contained silver from Byzantium (modern Turkey). What does THAT tell us about Anglo-Saxon trading connections?' Then: 'Why bury such valuable objects? What does this tell us about Anglo-Saxon beliefs about death?'

**Location:** British Museum, London
**URL:** https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/galleries/sutton-hoo-and-europe

### 2. Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People (Primary Written, )
Written by the Venerable Bede, a monk at Jarrow monastery in Northumbria. It is the primary narrative source for the history of the Anglo-Saxon conversion to Christianity and the early English Church. Bede wrote as a devout Christian with the explicit purpose of recording God's work in the conversion of the English. His perspective shapes what he includes and omits.

**How to use:** Read a simplified extract about Augustine's arrival in 597 AD. Ask: 'Bede was a monk. How might that affect what he wrote about the arrival of Christianity?' and 'What would a non-Christian Briton have said about the same events?' This develops understanding that the author's identity shapes their account.

**Location:** British Library, London (earliest manuscript copies)
**URL:** https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/bedes-ecclesiastical-history-of-the-english-people

### 3. Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (Primary Written, )
A collection of annals recording the history of the Anglo-Saxons, begun during the reign of Alfred the Great and continued in various monasteries until 1154. Multiple versions survive from different monasteries. The Chronicle was compiled retrospectively for earlier centuries and written contemporaneously from Alfred's reign. It reflects an Anglo-Saxon (and specifically West Saxon) perspective on events.

**How to use:** Compare the Chronicle's account of Viking raids with archaeological evidence from Viking-settled towns like Jorvik. Ask: 'The Chronicle was written by Anglo-Saxon monks. How might their account of Vikings differ from what the Vikings themselves would have said?' and 'The archaeological evidence shows Vikings as traders and craftspeople. Why might the Chronicle not mention this?' This is one of the best KS2 sources for teaching about perspective and bias.

**Location:** British Library, London; Corpus Christi College, Cambridge
**URL:** https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/anglo-saxon-chronicle

### 4. Lindisfarne Gospels (Primary Artistic, )
An illuminated manuscript Gospel book produced at Lindisfarne Priory, Northumbria. Created by Eadfrith, Bishop of Lindisfarne, in honour of St Cuthbert. The intricate decorated pages combine Celtic, Germanic and Mediterranean artistic traditions, demonstrating the cultural fusion of Anglo-Saxon Christianity.

**How to use:** Show the carpet page designs. Ask: 'What does the skill and beauty of this book tell us about how important Christianity was to Anglo-Saxon monks?' and 'The designs combine Celtic, Germanic and Roman styles. What does that tell us about the connections between different cultures in Anglo-Saxon Britain?'

## Disciplinary concepts foregrounded

| Concept | Key question | Role in this study |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Change and Continuity | What changed, what stayed the same, and why? | At KS2, identify what changed when the Anglo-Saxons arrived (language, religion, settlement) and what continuities persisted from Roman Britain. |
| Cause and Consequence | Why did this happen, and what were the effects? | At KS2, explain why the Anglo-Saxons migrated (push and pull factors) and the consequences for Britain's culture, language and identity. |
| Evidence and Interpretation | How do we know about this, and how do historians disagree? | At KS2, use the Sutton Hoo finds as primary evidence. Ask 'What can these objects tell us about the person buried here?' |
| Significance | Why does this matter, and to whom? | At KS2, evaluate the significance of Anglo-Saxon contributions to English identity, language and law. |

## Key figures and events

**Key figures:** King Ethelbert, Augustine of Canterbury, Hilda of Whitby, Bede

**Key events:**
- Anglo-Saxon migration c.450 AD
- Conversion to Christianity 597 AD
- Sutton Hoo burial c.625 AD
- Synod of Whitby 664 AD

**Period:** c.410 AD - 793 AD

**Perspectives to include:** Anglo-Saxon settler, existing Briton, Christian missionary, monastery scholar

**Significance claim:** The Anglo-Saxon settlement created the foundations of English identity, language, law and political geography that persist to this day, including the very concept of 'England' as a unified kingdom.

**Historiographical debate:**
- Debate over whether the Anglo-Saxon migration was a mass invasion or a gradual elite takeover of existing populations
- The extent to which Anglo-Saxon culture blended with or replaced existing British traditions remains contested

---

## Why this study matters

This topic bridges Roman Britain and the Viking period, helping pupils understand the continuous narrative of British history. The Sutton Hoo discovery provides a spectacular entry point for source-based enquiry, and the conversion to Christianity introduces the concept of how ideas can transform a society. The topic develops understanding of migration as a historical force that has shaped Britain repeatedly.

---

## Sequencing

**Follows:** Roman Britain
**Leads to:** Vikings and Anglo-Saxon England

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Presenting Anglo-Saxon migration as a sudden invasion rather than a gradual process of settlement over generations
2. Neglecting the existing British population and their interaction with Anglo-Saxon settlers
3. Treating Christianity's arrival as straightforwardly positive without examining the complexity of conversion and syncretism

## Historical thinking skills (KS2)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Chronological understanding** — Understand and use chronological frameworks to sequence events, periods and changes over time; develop a chronologically secure knowledge of British, local and world history using historical time vocabulary with increasing precision; construct and interpret timelines that place events in meaningful relation to each other.
- **Causation and consequence** — Understand why historical events and changes happened by identifying and explaining multiple causes; assess the intended and unintended consequences of events and decisions; distinguish between long-term structural factors and immediate triggers; construct causal arguments using historical evidence.
- **Change and continuity** — Identify what changed and what remained constant across historical periods; assess the pace, nature and extent of change; distinguish between long-term trends and short-term fluctuations; understand that change can be experienced differently by different groups within the same society.
- **Similarity and difference** — Identify and explain similarities and differences within and across historical periods, societies and cultures; avoid anachronism by understanding people's lives and choices within their own contexts; make valid comparisons that illuminate both the distinctiveness of periods and the common threads of human experience.
- **Historical significance** — Assess the significance of historical events, people and developments using explicit criteria such as scale of impact, duration, number of people affected, degree of change caused, and how an event is remembered and commemorated; understand that significance is not fixed but is constructed and contested by historians and societies over time.
- **Historical evidence** — Locate, select and use a range of primary and secondary historical sources; understand provenance and evaluate a source's utility and reliability in relation to a specific enquiry; corroborate claims across multiple sources; recognise that all sources are partial and that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
