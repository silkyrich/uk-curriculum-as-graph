## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **3 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Ancient Civilisations (HI-KS2-C004)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

The earliest civilisations - Ancient Sumer, the Indus Valley, Ancient Egypt and the Shang Dynasty of Ancient China - represent the first complex, literate human societies, emerging between approximately 3500 and 1200 BC in different parts of the world. They share characteristic features including writing systems, monumental architecture, complex religious and political hierarchies, specialised crafts and trade networks. Studying these civilisations develops pupils' understanding of how human societies developed from prehistoric hunter-gatherer communities to complex, literate, urban civilisations, and provides global perspective on the origins of human achievement.

**Teaching guidance:** Provide an overview of where and when the earliest civilisations appeared before conducting a depth study of one. Use maps to show that civilisations emerged independently in different parts of the world. Study the key features of the chosen civilisation in depth: its geography, political system, religious beliefs, achievements and daily life. Use artefacts, images of archaeological sites and translations of primary sources where available. Connect to pupils' general chronological framework: how long ago was this civilisation? What was happening in Britain at the same time?

**Key vocabulary:** civilisation, ancient, Bronze Age, settlement, city-state, pharaoh, hierarchy, irrigation, agriculture, trade, writing, archaeology, artefact, empire, legacy

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often think ancient civilisations were primitive or unsophisticated. Studying their technological, artistic and intellectual achievements challenges this. The concept of civilisation can carry value judgements; it is important to discuss what the term means without implying that non-urban societies are inferior. Pupils may not connect ancient civilisations to the present; discussing legacies (alphabet, legal codes, mathematics, architecture) makes the connection explicit.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recalling key facts about an ancient civilisation studied in class: where it was, when it existed, and one distinctive feature. | Tell me three facts about Ancient Egypt. | Confusing facts about different ancient civilisations; Using very vague time references ('a long time ago') without any sense of period |
| **Developing** | Describing key features of an ancient civilisation including its achievements, social structure or daily life, using specific details from study. | Describe the achievements of Ancient Egypt. What did the Egyptians create or discover that was impressive? | Listing achievements without giving specific details or examples; Describing achievements using modern comparisons that are anachronistic |
| **Expected** | Explaining how the geography, resources and environment of a region shaped the civilisation that developed there, using specific evidence. | How did the River Nile shape Ancient Egyptian civilisation? | Stating that the Nile was important without explaining the specific mechanisms; Not connecting geographical factors to social and political developments |
| **Greater Depth** | Comparing two ancient civilisations, identifying similarities and differences in their development, and considering why different civilisations developed different solutions to similar problems. | Both Ancient Egypt and the Indus Valley civilisation developed near rivers. Compare how each civilisation used its river environment. | Only identifying similarities or only differences, not both; Assuming one civilisation was 'better' than the other rather than comparing their approaches |

> **Model response (Entry):** *Ancient Egypt was in Africa along the River Nile. It existed thousands of years ago. The Egyptians built pyramids as tombs for their pharaohs.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *The Egyptians built enormous pyramids using precise mathematics. They invented hieroglyphic writing and wrote on papyrus. They developed a calendar based on the Nile's flooding, mummified their dead, and created beautiful art and jewellery.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *The Nile flooded every year, depositing fertile soil that allowed farming in an otherwise desert landscape. This meant people could settle permanently and grow surplus food, which allowed specialisation — some people could become builders, priests or scribes instead of farmers. The river also provided transport and water for drinking and irrigation. Without the Nile, Egyptian civilisation could not have developed as it did.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *Both civilisations depended on river flooding for agriculture and used rivers for transport and trade. However, the Indus Valley civilisation developed sophisticated drainage and sewage systems in its cities, while Egypt focused more on irrigation canals. Egypt's civilisation was more centralised under pharaohs, while the Indus Valley cities seem to have been more independently governed. Both found solutions to the same problem — how to use river water — but their solutions reflected different priorities.*

### Secondary concept: Cause and Consequence (HI-KS2-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Historical causation involves understanding why events happened - identifying the factors that made an event or change more or less likely, and explaining how those factors combined to produce historical outcomes. Consequence refers to the effects of events or changes - what happened as a result, both immediately and over longer periods. At KS2, pupils develop the ability to identify multiple causes and consequences for historical events, understanding that history is driven by the complex interaction of political, economic, social, religious and individual factors rather than single causes.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying a single cause or consequence of a historical event when given options or prompts. | Selecting an answer without being able to explain why it makes sense; Confusing cause (why something happened) with consequence (what happened as a result) |
| **Developing** | Describing more than one cause or consequence of a historical event and beginning to distinguish between short-term and long-term effects. | Listing causes without distinguishing their relative importance; Describing only immediate consequences and missing longer-term effects |
| **Expected** | Explaining how multiple causes combined to produce a historical event, and distinguishing between intended and unintended consequences. | Treating causes as a simple list rather than explaining how they interact; Assuming every consequence was intended by the historical actors |
| **Greater Depth** | Evaluating the relative importance of different causes, arguing which was most significant and supporting the argument with evidence. | Stating a cause is 'most important' without providing evidence or reasoning; Refusing to prioritise causes and insisting all were equally important without analysis |

### Secondary concept: Significance (HI-KS2-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Historical significance refers to the importance of a person, event or development in history, assessed by criteria such as the scale and duration of its impact, how many people were affected, whether it changed the course of events, whether people at the time thought it important, and how it is remembered and commemorated. Significance is not fixed: what seems significant from one perspective or in one time period may appear less so from another. At KS2, pupils begin to develop explicit criteria for judging historical significance and apply them to the people and events they study.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recalling why a person or event studied in class is considered important in history. | Confusing 'remembered' with 'significant' — something can be remembered but not important; Giving a circular answer: 'It is important because it is famous' |
| **Developing** | Using at least two criteria to explain why a historical event, person or development is significant. | Applying criteria mechanically without connecting them to specific evidence; Only using one criterion when asked for multiple |
| **Expected** | Explaining that significance can change over time or be viewed differently by different groups, using specific historical examples. | Treating significance as a fixed, objective fact rather than something that can be debated; Only considering the perspective of the 'winners' in a historical event |
| **Greater Depth** | Constructing an argument about which of several events or individuals was most historically significant, applying criteria systematically and considering counter-arguments. | Making an assertion without supporting it with historical evidence; Not acknowledging that the other side of the argument has merit |

### Secondary concept: Historical Evidence and Interpretation (HI-KS2-C003)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Historians construct interpretations of the past from the evidence that survives. Evidence includes primary sources (created at the time) and secondary sources (created after the fact), each with distinctive strengths and limitations. Historians also interpret the same evidence differently based on their questions, frameworks and perspectives, which is why different historical accounts of the same events can reach different conclusions. At KS2, pupils develop the ability to work with and evaluate a range of historical sources, and to understand that historical knowledge is constructed through the interpretation of evidence rather than simply discovered.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying whether a source is from the time being studied (primary) or created later (secondary), and stating one thing the source tells us. | Confusing primary and secondary sources; Describing the physical appearance of the source without saying what it tells us about the past |
| **Developing** | Asking questions about who created a source, when and why, and considering what it can and cannot tell us. | Accepting the source at face value without questioning its origin or purpose; Dismissing a biased source as useless rather than recognising what it still reveals |
| **Expected** | Comparing two or more sources about the same event, identifying where they agree and disagree, and explaining why different interpretations exist. | Assuming the modern account must be correct and the older one wrong; Not explaining why the differences exist, only listing them |
| **Greater Depth** | Evaluating the reliability and utility of sources for answering specific historical questions, and understanding that interpretation changes as new evidence emerges. | Thinking historical facts never change, rather than understanding that interpretations evolve; Assuming that newer interpretations are always better without considering the evidence |

## Thinking lens: Systems and System Models (primary)

**Key question:** What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?

**Why this lens fits:** Ancient civilisations are studied as organised societies — pupils examine how early states structured their governance, agriculture, religion and trade as interlocking systems, developing comparative thinking about what makes a civilisation function.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- What goes into this system, and what comes out?
- If you changed this one part, what else would be affected?
- Where does this system start and end?
- How could we draw a model to explain how this works?

**Secondary lens:** Cause and Effect — This cluster introduces the second-order concept of causation directly — pupils learn to identify multiple causes, organise them into categories, and trace short and long-term consequences, which is the defining cognitive demand of causal-chain historical reasoning.

## Session structure: Topic Study + Comparison Study

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Topic Study (main structure)
A structured enquiry into a defined topic, period, or place. Begins with an engaging hook to capture interest, builds contextual knowledge, moves through source analysis and interpretation, and culminates in a substantiated argument or conclusion. The core humanities template.

`hook` → `context` → `source_analysis` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Extended writing task presenting a reasoned argument supported by evidence from the topic. Can take the form of an essay, structured explanation, or debate position.

**Teacher note:** Use the TOPIC STUDY template: open with an engaging hook that raises a question or challenge. Build context using a timeline or key facts. Introduce 2-3 sources for pupils to analyse, prompting them to consider who made each source and why. Guide pupils toward forming their own interpretation, supported by evidence from the sources.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What does this source tell us, and what does it leave out?
- Who created this source, and why might that matter?
- Do these two sources agree or disagree? How can you tell?
- What is your interpretation, and what evidence supports it?

### Comparison Study
A structured comparison of two or more examples, places, periods, or perspectives. Introduces each example with sufficient context, applies a systematic comparison framework, analyses similarities and differences with supporting evidence, and reaches an evaluative conclusion about the significance of those differences.

`introduce_examples` → `systematic_comparison` → `analysis` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Comparative analysis using a structured framework (table, Venn diagram, or essay), demonstrating understanding of both examples and reaching a substantiated evaluative conclusion.

**Teacher note:** Use the COMPARISON STUDY template: introduce two clear examples — places, periods, beliefs, or phenomena — with enough detail for pupils to identify similarities and differences. Guide systematic comparison using a table or Venn diagram. Prompt pupils to explain why there are similarities or differences, not just list them.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What is the same about these two examples?
- What is different, and why might that be?
- Which similarity or difference is the most important? Why?
- Can you organise your comparisons in a table or diagram?

## Primary sources

2 historically grounded source types are available for this study:

### 1. Arabic Scientific and Medical Manuscripts (Primary Written, )
Manuscripts produced by scholars working in the Islamic world, particularly Baghdad's House of Wisdom. These include translations and extensions of Greek scientific and philosophical texts, original works on algebra, medicine, optics and astronomy. Al-Khwarizmi's algebra treatise and Ibn Sina's Canon of Medicine are among the most influential. Many survive in libraries across the Islamic world and Europe.

**How to use:** Show a page from an Arabic astronomical manuscript alongside a later European text that translated it. Ask: 'How did knowledge travel from Baghdad to Europe?' and 'Why do we use Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3) rather than Roman numerals (I, II, III) today?' This develops understanding of how knowledge transfers across cultures and challenges Eurocentric narratives.

**Location:** Bodleian Library, Oxford; British Library, London; various libraries in Istanbul, Cairo and Tehran
**URL:** https://www.bl.uk/collection-guides/islamic-scientific-manuscripts

### 2. Astrolabes from the Islamic World (Primary Technological, )
Navigational and astronomical instruments developed and refined by Islamic scholars. An astrolabe can determine the time, the direction of Mecca for prayer, and the positions of celestial bodies. They demonstrate the mathematical and engineering sophistication of Islamic civilisation. Many surviving examples are beautifully engraved with Arabic calligraphy.

**How to use:** Show an astrolabe and explain what it does. Ask: 'What does the existence of this instrument tell us about what Islamic scholars knew about mathematics and astronomy?' and 'Why would a navigator, a scientist AND a religious person all need an astrolabe?' This connects scientific knowledge to practical and religious application.

**Location:** Museum of the History of Science, Oxford; British Museum, London; Museum of Islamic Art, Doha
**URL:** https://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/collections/imu-search-page/browse-by-category/?browse=astrolabes

## Disciplinary concepts foregrounded

| Concept | Key question | Role in this study |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Significance | Why does this matter, and to whom? | At KS2, evaluate the lasting significance of Islamic contributions to mathematics, science and medicine using the 5 Rs. |
| Similarity and Difference | How was this similar to or different from other times, places, or peoples? | At KS2, compare Baghdad c.900 CE with Anglo-Saxon England at the same time. What does the comparison reveal? |
| Cause and Consequence | Why did this happen, and what were the effects? | At KS2, explain WHY Baghdad became a centre of learning: trade, patronage, translation movement. |
| Evidence and Interpretation | How do we know about this, and how do historians disagree? | At KS2, use Arabic manuscripts and architectural evidence to make inferences about Islamic scholarly culture. |

## Key figures and events

**Key figures:** Muhammad, Harun al-Rashid, Al-Khwarizmi, Ibn Sina (Avicenna)

**Key events:**
- Founding of Baghdad 762 CE
- House of Wisdom established c.800 CE
- Golden Age of Islamic scholarship c.800-1200 CE

**Period:** c.600 CE - 1200 CE

**Perspectives to include:** scholar at House of Wisdom, merchant on trade routes, caliph, European visitor

**Significance claim:** Early Islamic civilisation made foundational contributions to mathematics, medicine, astronomy and philosophy that shaped the development of modern science and scholarship worldwide.

**Historiographical debate:**
- The extent to which the House of Wisdom was a single institution or a network of scholarly activity is debated
- Historians discuss whether the Golden Age of Islam ended because of internal factors or the Mongol destruction of Baghdad in 1258

---

## Why this study matters

Early Islamic civilisation offers a powerful counter-narrative to Eurocentric views of the 'Dark Ages': while Western Europe experienced fragmentation after Rome's fall, Baghdad was the world's leading centre of scholarship. The topic develops understanding of how knowledge transfers across cultures.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Conflating historical Islamic civilisation with modern Islam or modern Middle Eastern politics
2. Presenting early Islamic scholarship as merely preserving Greek knowledge rather than advancing it significantly
3. Failing to explain the geographic and economic factors that made Baghdad a centre of learning

## Sensitive content

- Be sensitive to Muslim pupils in the class who may feel pride or pressure about this topic
- Avoid presenting Islam as monolithic; early Islamic civilisation was religiously and ethnically diverse
- Take care not to create an 'us vs them' framing between European and Islamic civilisations

---

## Cross-curricular opportunities

| Link | Subject | Connection | Strength |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| Trade, Economic Geography and Fairtrade | Geography | Trade routes connecting Baghdad to the wider world; the Silk Road | Moderate |
| William Morris Pattern Design | Art and Design | Islamic geometric patterns and calligraphy as art forms | Strong |

## Historical thinking skills (KS2)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Chronological understanding** — Understand and use chronological frameworks to sequence events, periods and changes over time; develop a chronologically secure knowledge of British, local and world history using historical time vocabulary with increasing precision; construct and interpret timelines that place events in meaningful relation to each other.
- **Causation and consequence** — Understand why historical events and changes happened by identifying and explaining multiple causes; assess the intended and unintended consequences of events and decisions; distinguish between long-term structural factors and immediate triggers; construct causal arguments using historical evidence.
- **Change and continuity** — Identify what changed and what remained constant across historical periods; assess the pace, nature and extent of change; distinguish between long-term trends and short-term fluctuations; understand that change can be experienced differently by different groups within the same society.
- **Similarity and difference** — Identify and explain similarities and differences within and across historical periods, societies and cultures; avoid anachronism by understanding people's lives and choices within their own contexts; make valid comparisons that illuminate both the distinctiveness of periods and the common threads of human experience.
- **Historical significance** — Assess the significance of historical events, people and developments using explicit criteria such as scale of impact, duration, number of people affected, degree of change caused, and how an event is remembered and commemorated; understand that significance is not fixed but is constructed and contested by historians and societies over time.
- **Historical evidence** — Locate, select and use a range of primary and secondary historical sources; understand provenance and evaluate a source's utility and reliability in relation to a specific enquiry; corroborate claims across multiple sources; recognise that all sources are partial and that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
