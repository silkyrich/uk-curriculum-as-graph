## Enquiry questions

1. What is the most significant building, place or person in the history of our local area?
2. How has our local area changed over time?
3. What can we find out about local history from sources in our area?

---

## Concepts

This study delivers **2 primary concepts** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Historical Sources and Evidence (HI-KS1-C004)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Historical sources are the materials from which historians reconstruct the past - artefacts, photographs, documents, buildings, oral testimonies and other traces that survive from earlier times. Historical evidence is information extracted from sources by asking questions about them. At KS1, pupils begin to work with a range of sources, developing the ability to observe carefully, ask questions, extract information and begin to understand that sources provide evidence rather than complete and unmediated truth. This introduces the idea that history is a process of interpretation as well as discovery.

**Teaching guidance:** Bring a range of historical sources into the classroom: artefacts (or replicas), old photographs, letters, maps and accounts. Teach pupils a simple enquiry process: observe, question, infer, connect. Ask pupils what a source tells us and what it does not tell us. Compare sources about the same event or person. Use visit resources: museums, historic sites, community collections. Develop vocabulary for discussing sources: what is it? Who made it? When? Why? What can we learn from it? Begin to distinguish between primary (from the time) and secondary (written about the time later) sources.

**Key vocabulary:** source, evidence, artefact, document, photograph, account, primary source, secondary source, observe, question, infer, reliable, bias, interpret, past

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may treat all sources as equally reliable and complete. Introducing the idea that sources can be partial, biased or misleading even at KS1 develops critical thinking. Pupils may not understand that historians do not know everything about the past; emphasising what we do not know as well as what we do know models intellectual honesty. The concept of primary sources from 'the time' can be confusing; concrete examples help.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Observing a historical source (photograph, artefact, picture) and saying what they can see. | Look at this old photograph of a street. Tell me three things you can see in the picture. | Making up details that are not visible in the source; Describing feelings about the picture rather than what is actually shown |
| **Developing** | Asking simple questions about a historical source and suggesting what it might tell us about the past. | Look at this old toy. What questions could you ask about it? What does it tell us about children in the past? | Asking questions that cannot be answered from the source; Assuming the source tells us everything about the past rather than just one part |
| **Expected** | Using more than one source to find out about a historical event or person, and recognising that sources can tell us different things. | Here is a photograph and a letter from the same period. What does each one tell us? Do they tell us the same things or different things? | Treating both sources as saying the same thing rather than offering different perspectives; Not recognising that sources have limitations — each one only shows part of the story |

> **Model response (Entry):** *I can see a horse pulling a cart. There are people wearing long clothes. The road is made of cobblestones.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *I wonder who played with it and how old it is. It tells us that children in the past played with wooden toys, not plastic ones. It doesn't have batteries so children had to use their imagination.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *The photograph shows us what the building looked like — it had a thatched roof and small windows. The letter tells us how the person who lived there felt — they said it was cold in winter. The photograph shows the outside but the letter tells us about life inside. Together they tell us more than one source alone.*

### Primary concept: Local and National History (HI-KS1-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

History operates at different scales: the history of one's own locality connects personal and community identity to the broader national story, while national history provides the shared context within which local history is understood. The curriculum requires both local and national history at KS1, recognising that pupils' sense of historical belonging is rooted in the local even as they need to understand broader national narratives. Local history also provides access to primary sources and physical traces of the past that national history cannot always offer.

**Teaching guidance:** Identify significant local historical events, people and places before beginning this study. Use local resources: the school building itself, local churches, markets, museums, community elders. Connect local history to national history: how did national events affect the local area? What local figures played a national role? Use photographs of the local area from different periods. Invite local historians or community members to talk to the class. Develop a sense of pride in and curiosity about the local environment.

**Key vocabulary:** local, national, community, heritage, identity, historical site, landmark, oral history, tradition, ancestors, settlement, record, archive, census

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may think local history is less important than national history. Emphasising that every national story is made up of local stories challenges this hierarchy. Pupils may not know the history of the places they visit every day; structured observation and questioning activities reveal the historical layers of familiar environments. The concept of oral history (passed down through conversation rather than writing) may be unfamiliar but is often very accessible and personally relevant to pupils.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recalling a fact about a local historical event, person or place studied in class. | Tell me one thing you learned about the history of our school or local area. | Confusing local history facts with general history knowledge; Not being able to recall any specific local historical detail |
| **Developing** | Describing a local historical event or feature and explaining how it connects to the wider area or community. | Why is the war memorial in our town important to the local community? | Describing the physical feature without explaining its historical or community significance; Not making connections between the local feature and the people who use it |
| **Expected** | Connecting local history to national history, explaining how a national event affected the local area or how a local story is part of a bigger picture. | During World War Two, many children were evacuated from cities. How did evacuation affect our local area? | Treating local and national history as completely separate topics; Describing the national event without connecting it to the specific local impact |

> **Model response (Entry):** *Our school was built over 100 years ago. The old photograph shows it looked different — there was no playground.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *The war memorial has the names of people from our town who died in the wars. It is important because families come to remember their relatives and the whole community gathers there on Remembrance Day.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Children from London were sent to our village to be safe from the bombing. Local families had to look after children they had never met. This shows how a national event — the war — changed life in our local area. Some evacuees stayed and became part of the community.*

### Secondary concept: Time and Chronology (HI-KS1-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Chronology is the ordering of events and periods in time. Understanding chronology requires both the vocabulary of time (before, after, then, now, long ago, recently, past, present) and the ability to place events and people in sequence relative to each other. At KS1, pupils develop chronological understanding beginning with their own life histories and moving outwards to family memories, local history and national events. Placing events on timelines, sequencing pictures and comparing 'old' and 'new' versions of familiar objects are key activities that develop chronological awareness.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recognising and using basic time vocabulary (before, after, now, then, long ago) to describe the order of two events. | Using 'before' and 'after' interchangeably without distinguishing their meaning; Placing all events described as 'old' at the same point in the past |
| **Developing** | Sequencing three or more events or objects on a simple timeline, using vocabulary such as 'first', 'next', 'then', 'finally', 'a long time ago'. | Ordering by personal preference rather than chronological sequence; Placing the steam train after the car because trains are less familiar |
| **Expected** | Placing events, people and objects from different periods on a timeline and explaining how they know the order, using evidence from sources. | Placing objects in order of size or appearance rather than age; Not being able to explain the reasoning behind the sequence |
| **Greater Depth** | Using chronological understanding to explain that different periods of time varied in length, and that some changes happened quickly while others took a long time. | Assuming all historical change happens at the same pace; Struggling to grasp that 'hundreds of years' and '20 years' represent very different spans of time |

### Secondary concept: Change and Continuity (HI-KS1-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Historical change refers to the ways in which people's lives, beliefs, institutions and the world around them have transformed over time. Continuity refers to aspects that remain the same over long periods despite other changes. Understanding change and continuity requires pupils to identify what has changed, what has stayed the same, and to consider why some things change while others persist. At KS1, pupils explore change through comparing everyday objects, homes, transport and daily life across different time periods within living memory and beyond.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying one thing that has changed and one thing that has stayed the same when comparing old and new versions of a familiar object or setting. | Identifying only differences and not recognising any continuity; Focusing solely on colour differences in photographs rather than meaningful changes |
| **Developing** | Describing several changes and continuities between past and present in a familiar context, using comparative language. | Assuming everything in the past was completely different from today; Listing changes without using comparative language (older/newer, more/fewer) |
| **Expected** | Explaining why some things have changed while others have stayed the same, giving reasons linked to people's needs or new inventions. | Describing changes without offering any explanation for why they happened; Treating all change as automatic 'progress' rather than a response to needs |
| **Greater Depth** | Recognising that change can involve loss as well as gain, and that not everyone experiences change in the same way. | Viewing all historical change as purely positive progress; Struggling to imagine disadvantages of modern inventions |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Studying significant individuals asks pupils to trace the consequences of particular people's actions on events and society — why did this person matter? what changed because of what they did? — which is explicitly causal-chain reasoning applied to historical biography and local/national narrative.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What made that happen?
- What will happen if...?
- Why did it change?
- Can you finish: it happened because...?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Handling artefacts, photographs and documents and asking what they show is the most direct application of evidence-based reasoning in the primary curriculum — pupils learn that historical knowledge comes from interpreting incomplete, partial sources rather than from received fact.

---

## Session structure: Topic Study

### Topic Study
A structured enquiry into a defined topic, period, or place. Begins with an engaging hook to capture interest, builds contextual knowledge, moves through source analysis and interpretation, and culminates in a substantiated argument or conclusion. The core humanities template.

`hook` → `context` → `source_analysis` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Extended writing task presenting a reasoned argument supported by evidence from the topic. Can take the form of an essay, structured explanation, or debate position.

**Teacher note:** Use the TOPIC STUDY template: begin with a simple hook that captures children's curiosity — a picture, an object, or a short story. Provide context through visual and sensory experiences. Guide children to look at one source closely, describing what they can see. Ask them to say what they think it tells us, using 'I think... because...' sentences.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What can you see in this picture?
- What do you think this tells us about life long ago?
- What is the same as today? What is different?
- How do you know? What clues can you spot?

## Disciplinary concepts foregrounded

| Concept | Key question | Role in this study |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Evidence and Interpretation | How do we know about this, and how do historians disagree? | At KS1, use local sources (buildings, photos, objects, people's memories) to find out about the past. Ask 'How do we know about this?' |
| Significance | Why does this matter, and to whom? | At KS1, ask 'Why is this person/place/event important to our local area?' |
| Change and Continuity | What changed, what stayed the same, and why? | At KS1, compare the local area 'then' and 'now' using photos and maps. |

## Why this study matters

Local history at KS1 makes history tangible: pupils can walk to the historical sites, handle local artefacts, and hear stories from community elders. It develops the foundational understanding that history is not just about distant places and famous people but about the places and people pupils know.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Choosing a topic too broad rather than focusing on one significant local person, event or place
2. Not connecting the local study to the broader concepts (chronology, significance, change) being developed across KS1 History

## Sensitive content

- Local history may touch on difficult aspects of community history; handle with sensitivity
- Some pupils may not have deep local roots; ensure the study is inclusive

## Cross-curricular opportunities

| Link | Subject | Connection | Strength |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| Our Local Area | Geography | Local map skills: identifying historical features on a map of the school's area | Strong |
| Recount: My Weekend | English | Writing about a local historical person or place; recording oral histories | Strong |

## Historical thinking skills (KS1)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Chronological understanding** — Understand and use chronological frameworks to sequence events, periods and changes over time; develop a chronologically secure knowledge of British, local and world history using historical time vocabulary with increasing precision; construct and interpret timelines that place events in meaningful relation to each other.
- **Causation and consequence** — Understand why historical events and changes happened by identifying and explaining multiple causes; assess the intended and unintended consequences of events and decisions; distinguish between long-term structural factors and immediate triggers; construct causal arguments using historical evidence.
- **Change and continuity** — Identify what changed and what remained constant across historical periods; assess the pace, nature and extent of change; distinguish between long-term trends and short-term fluctuations; understand that change can be experienced differently by different groups within the same society.
- **Similarity and difference** — Identify and explain similarities and differences within and across historical periods, societies and cultures; avoid anachronism by understanding people's lives and choices within their own contexts; make valid comparisons that illuminate both the distinctiveness of periods and the common threads of human experience.
- **Historical significance** — Assess the significance of historical events, people and developments using explicit criteria such as scale of impact, duration, number of people affected, degree of change caused, and how an event is remembered and commemorated; understand that significance is not fixed but is constructed and contested by historians and societies over time.
- **Historical evidence** — Locate, select and use a range of primary and secondary historical sources; understand provenance and evaluate a source's utility and reliability in relation to a specific enquiry; corroborate claims across multiple sources; recognise that all sources are partial and that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
