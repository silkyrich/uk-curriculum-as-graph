## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Significant Individuals and Their Impact (HI-KS1-C003)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

History includes the study of significant individuals whose actions, discoveries, decisions or achievements have had lasting consequences for other people and subsequent generations. Significance is determined by the scale and duration of impact, the extent to which an individual changed the course of events, and the degree to which they are remembered and commemorated. At KS1, pupils learn about significant individuals from different historical periods and contexts, comparing figures from different times to understand how contexts shape lives and possibilities.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce significant individuals through stories, photographs, artefacts and primary sources. Help pupils understand why each individual is significant: what did they do, and what difference did it make? Use paired comparisons specified in the curriculum (e.g., Florence Nightingale and Mary Seacole) to develop understanding of how context shapes significance and recognition. Discuss why some historical figures are well-known while others have been overlooked, introducing the idea that history involves selection and interpretation. Include significant individuals from diverse backgrounds, genders and cultures.

**Key vocabulary:** significant, achievement, contribution, impact, legacy, commemorate, famous, discover, invent, lead, inspire, pioneer, historical figure, biography

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may think significant individuals were born special rather than shaped by context and choices. Discussing the obstacles individuals faced develops understanding of the conditions that make significance possible. Pupils may not question why some historical figures are more prominent than others; discussing who decides which figures are remembered develops critical historical thinking. The distinction between fact (what we know happened) and opinion (how we judge its significance) is important to introduce early.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recalling basic facts about a significant individual studied in class: their name, when they lived, and one thing they did. | Tell me one thing you remember about Florence Nightingale. | Confusing details of different significant individuals studied; Remembering the story but not the person's name |
| **Developing** | Describing what a significant individual did and beginning to explain why their actions mattered to other people. | What did Mary Seacole do, and why was it important? | Describing actions without connecting them to their impact on others; Retelling the individual's story as a simple sequence without explaining significance |
| **Expected** | Explaining why an individual is considered significant by identifying the impact of their actions and comparing them with another individual. | Both Florence Nightingale and Mary Seacole helped soldiers in the Crimean War. How were their contributions similar and different? | Stating that one individual was 'better' than the other rather than comparing contributions; Focusing only on similarities or only on differences, not both |
| **Greater Depth** | Evaluating why some individuals are better remembered than others, considering factors such as bias, record-keeping and whose stories get told. | Florence Nightingale is more famous than Mary Seacole. Why might that be? Is fame the same as importance? | Equating fame with historical significance; Not considering that record-keeping and social factors affect who gets remembered |

> **Model response (Entry):** *Florence Nightingale helped sick soldiers in a hospital. She carried a lamp at night to check on them.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Mary Seacole travelled to the Crimean War to help injured soldiers. She set up a hotel near the battlefield where soldiers could get medicine and food. It was important because the soldiers needed help and she made them better.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Both helped sick and injured soldiers and both were brave to go to a war zone. Florence Nightingale worked in a hospital and changed how hospitals were kept clean. Mary Seacole went closer to the battlefield and paid for her own supplies. Florence Nightingale became more famous at the time, but both made a big difference.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *Florence Nightingale was more famous because she was written about more and came from a wealthy family, so more people heard about her. Mary Seacole faced prejudice because of her background. Being famous doesn't always mean being more important — Mary Seacole helped just as many soldiers but fewer people told her story.*

### Secondary concept: Time and Chronology (HI-KS1-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Chronology is the ordering of events and periods in time. Understanding chronology requires both the vocabulary of time (before, after, then, now, long ago, recently, past, present) and the ability to place events and people in sequence relative to each other. At KS1, pupils develop chronological understanding beginning with their own life histories and moving outwards to family memories, local history and national events. Placing events on timelines, sequencing pictures and comparing 'old' and 'new' versions of familiar objects are key activities that develop chronological awareness.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recognising and using basic time vocabulary (before, after, now, then, long ago) to describe the order of two events. | Using 'before' and 'after' interchangeably without distinguishing their meaning; Placing all events described as 'old' at the same point in the past |
| **Developing** | Sequencing three or more events or objects on a simple timeline, using vocabulary such as 'first', 'next', 'then', 'finally', 'a long time ago'. | Ordering by personal preference rather than chronological sequence; Placing the steam train after the car because trains are less familiar |
| **Expected** | Placing events, people and objects from different periods on a timeline and explaining how they know the order, using evidence from sources. | Placing objects in order of size or appearance rather than age; Not being able to explain the reasoning behind the sequence |
| **Greater Depth** | Using chronological understanding to explain that different periods of time varied in length, and that some changes happened quickly while others took a long time. | Assuming all historical change happens at the same pace; Struggling to grasp that 'hundreds of years' and '20 years' represent very different spans of time |

### Secondary concept: Historical Sources and Evidence (HI-KS1-C004)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Historical sources are the materials from which historians reconstruct the past - artefacts, photographs, documents, buildings, oral testimonies and other traces that survive from earlier times. Historical evidence is information extracted from sources by asking questions about them. At KS1, pupils begin to work with a range of sources, developing the ability to observe carefully, ask questions, extract information and begin to understand that sources provide evidence rather than complete and unmediated truth. This introduces the idea that history is a process of interpretation as well as discovery.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Observing a historical source (photograph, artefact, picture) and saying what they can see. | Making up details that are not visible in the source; Describing feelings about the picture rather than what is actually shown |
| **Developing** | Asking simple questions about a historical source and suggesting what it might tell us about the past. | Asking questions that cannot be answered from the source; Assuming the source tells us everything about the past rather than just one part |
| **Expected** | Using more than one source to find out about a historical event or person, and recognising that sources can tell us different things. | Treating both sources as saying the same thing rather than offering different perspectives; Not recognising that sources have limitations — each one only shows part of the story |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Studying significant individuals asks pupils to trace the consequences of particular people's actions on events and society — why did this person matter? what changed because of what they did? — which is explicitly causal-chain reasoning applied to historical biography and local/national narrative.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What made that happen?
- What will happen if...?
- Why did it change?
- Can you finish: it happened because...?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Handling artefacts, photographs and documents and asking what they show is the most direct application of evidence-based reasoning in the primary curriculum — pupils learn that historical knowledge comes from interpreting incomplete, partial sources rather than from received fact.

## Session structure: Topic Study + Comparison Study

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Topic Study (main structure)
A structured enquiry into a defined topic, period, or place. Begins with an engaging hook to capture interest, builds contextual knowledge, moves through source analysis and interpretation, and culminates in a substantiated argument or conclusion. The core humanities template.

`hook` → `context` → `source_analysis` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Extended writing task presenting a reasoned argument supported by evidence from the topic. Can take the form of an essay, structured explanation, or debate position.

**Teacher note:** Use the TOPIC STUDY template: begin with a simple hook that captures children's curiosity — a picture, an object, or a short story. Provide context through visual and sensory experiences. Guide children to look at one source closely, describing what they can see. Ask them to say what they think it tells us, using 'I think... because...' sentences.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What can you see in this picture?
- What do you think this tells us about life long ago?
- What is the same as today? What is different?
- How do you know? What clues can you spot?

### Comparison Study
A structured comparison of two or more examples, places, periods, or perspectives. Introduces each example with sufficient context, applies a systematic comparison framework, analyses similarities and differences with supporting evidence, and reaches an evaluative conclusion about the significance of those differences.

`introduce_examples` → `systematic_comparison` → `analysis` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Comparative analysis using a structured framework (table, Venn diagram, or essay), demonstrating understanding of both examples and reaching a substantiated evaluative conclusion.

## Disciplinary concepts foregrounded

| Concept | Key question | Role in this study |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Significance | Why does this matter, and to whom? | At KS1, significance means asking 'What difference did this person make?' and 'Why do we still remember them?' |
| Similarity and Difference | How was this similar to or different from other times, places, or peoples? | At KS1, compare what both women fought for and how they did it. What was the same? What was different? |
| Cause and Consequence | Why did this happen, and what were the effects? | At KS1, ask 'What happened because of what Rosa Parks/Emily Davison did?' |

## Key figures and events

**Key figures:** Rosa Parks, Emily Davison

**Key events:**
- Emily Davison's protest at Epsom Derby 1913
- Rosa Parks refuses to give up her bus seat 1955

**Period:** 1872-2005

**Perspectives to include:** Rosa Parks, Emily Davison, people who supported them, people who opposed them

**Significance claim:** Both women challenged injustice through acts of personal courage that became symbols of wider movements for equality. Davison fought for women's right to vote; Parks challenged racial segregation. Their actions had consequences far beyond their individual lives.

---

## Why this study matters

This pairing connects two struggles for equality across different times, countries and contexts. It develops the concept of significance (how one person's action can spark a movement) and similarity and difference (how different forms of injustice require different forms of resistance). It introduces age-appropriate discussion of fairness, rights and standing up for what is right.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Oversimplifying the movements these women were part of: Parks was part of a planned strategy, not just a tired woman who refused to stand
2. Not explaining what segregation and suffrage mean at an age-appropriate level
3. Reducing their stories to individual heroism without connecting to the wider movements

## Sensitive content

- Racial segregation and gender inequality are difficult topics; discuss as 'unfairness' at an age-appropriate level
- Emily Davison died as a result of her protest; handle with care for young pupils
- Be sensitive to pupils from different racial backgrounds when discussing Parks and segregation

---

## Cross-curricular opportunities

| Link | Subject | Connection | Strength |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| Narrative: Dogger | English | Writing about fairness and standing up for what is right | Strong |
| Human Rights: What Are They and Why Do They Matter? | General | Rights and responsibilities; why do rules need to be fair? | Strong |

## Historical thinking skills (KS1)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Chronological understanding** — Understand and use chronological frameworks to sequence events, periods and changes over time; develop a chronologically secure knowledge of British, local and world history using historical time vocabulary with increasing precision; construct and interpret timelines that place events in meaningful relation to each other.
- **Causation and consequence** — Understand why historical events and changes happened by identifying and explaining multiple causes; assess the intended and unintended consequences of events and decisions; distinguish between long-term structural factors and immediate triggers; construct causal arguments using historical evidence.
- **Change and continuity** — Identify what changed and what remained constant across historical periods; assess the pace, nature and extent of change; distinguish between long-term trends and short-term fluctuations; understand that change can be experienced differently by different groups within the same society.
- **Similarity and difference** — Identify and explain similarities and differences within and across historical periods, societies and cultures; avoid anachronism by understanding people's lives and choices within their own contexts; make valid comparisons that illuminate both the distinctiveness of periods and the common threads of human experience.
- **Historical significance** — Assess the significance of historical events, people and developments using explicit criteria such as scale of impact, duration, number of people affected, degree of change caused, and how an event is remembered and commemorated; understand that significance is not fixed but is constructed and contested by historians and societies over time.
- **Historical evidence** — Locate, select and use a range of primary and secondary historical sources; understand provenance and evaluate a source's utility and reliability in relation to a specific enquiry; corroborate claims across multiple sources; recognise that all sources are partial and that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
