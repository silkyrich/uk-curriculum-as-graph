## Enquiry questions

1. How has daily life changed since your grandparents were children?
2. What has changed in our school or local area within living memory?
3. What has stayed the same despite all the changes?

---

## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Change and Continuity (HI-KS1-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Historical change refers to the ways in which people's lives, beliefs, institutions and the world around them have transformed over time. Continuity refers to aspects that remain the same over long periods despite other changes. Understanding change and continuity requires pupils to identify what has changed, what has stayed the same, and to consider why some things change while others persist. At KS1, pupils explore change through comparing everyday objects, homes, transport and daily life across different time periods within living memory and beyond.

**Teaching guidance:** Use paired comparison activities: show an old and a new version of the same type of object and ask pupils to identify what has changed and what is similar. Explore change in everyday life by comparing their grandparents' childhood with their own (food, transport, entertainment, school). Look at photographs of the local area from different time periods. Distinguish between fast change (a technology like mobile phones) and slow change (landscape, traditions). Avoid presenting change as simple improvement or progress; discuss what is lost as well as what is gained.

**Key vocabulary:** change, continuity, same, different, transform, develop, improve, tradition, modern, old, new, before, after, progress, development

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may assume all change represents progress or improvement. Discussing examples where change has involved loss (community customs, local buildings) develops a more nuanced understanding. The concept of continuity can be harder for pupils to grasp than change; using familiar examples (stories, celebrations, family customs) that have remained constant across generations helps.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying one thing that has changed and one thing that has stayed the same when comparing old and new versions of a familiar object or setting. | Look at this old photograph of a classroom and this photograph of our classroom. Tell me one thing that is different and one thing that is the same. | Identifying only differences and not recognising any continuity; Focusing solely on colour differences in photographs rather than meaningful changes |
| **Developing** | Describing several changes and continuities between past and present in a familiar context, using comparative language. | Compare how children travelled to school in your grandparents' time with how you travel to school. List things that have changed and things that have stayed the same. | Assuming everything in the past was completely different from today; Listing changes without using comparative language (older/newer, more/fewer) |
| **Expected** | Explaining why some things have changed while others have stayed the same, giving reasons linked to people's needs or new inventions. | Telephones have changed a lot since they were invented, but people still use them to talk to each other. Why has the telephone changed, and why do people still want to talk to each other? | Describing changes without offering any explanation for why they happened; Treating all change as automatic 'progress' rather than a response to needs |
| **Greater Depth** | Recognising that change can involve loss as well as gain, and that not everyone experiences change in the same way. | When cars replaced horses for transport, was this change entirely good? Think about what was gained and what might have been lost. | Viewing all historical change as purely positive progress; Struggling to imagine disadvantages of modern inventions |

> **Model response (Entry):** *The old classroom has wooden desks in rows — that is different. Both classrooms have a board at the front — that is the same.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Changed: grandparents walked or cycled more, there were fewer cars, no car seats. Stayed the same: children still walk to school sometimes, school is still in the morning, parents still take children to school.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Telephones changed because people invented better technology — first they had wires, then they became mobile. But people still want to talk because they need to share news, ask questions and stay in touch with family. The need stayed the same but the way we do it changed.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *Cars are faster and can carry more, so people could travel further. But horses didn't cause pollution, and people who worked with horses lost their jobs. Some people in the countryside still preferred horses. So the change was good in some ways but not in every way.*

### Secondary concept: Time and Chronology (HI-KS1-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Chronology is the ordering of events and periods in time. Understanding chronology requires both the vocabulary of time (before, after, then, now, long ago, recently, past, present) and the ability to place events and people in sequence relative to each other. At KS1, pupils develop chronological understanding beginning with their own life histories and moving outwards to family memories, local history and national events. Placing events on timelines, sequencing pictures and comparing 'old' and 'new' versions of familiar objects are key activities that develop chronological awareness.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recognising and using basic time vocabulary (before, after, now, then, long ago) to describe the order of two events. | Using 'before' and 'after' interchangeably without distinguishing their meaning; Placing all events described as 'old' at the same point in the past |
| **Developing** | Sequencing three or more events or objects on a simple timeline, using vocabulary such as 'first', 'next', 'then', 'finally', 'a long time ago'. | Ordering by personal preference rather than chronological sequence; Placing the steam train after the car because trains are less familiar |
| **Expected** | Placing events, people and objects from different periods on a timeline and explaining how they know the order, using evidence from sources. | Placing objects in order of size or appearance rather than age; Not being able to explain the reasoning behind the sequence |
| **Greater Depth** | Using chronological understanding to explain that different periods of time varied in length, and that some changes happened quickly while others took a long time. | Assuming all historical change happens at the same pace; Struggling to grasp that 'hundreds of years' and '20 years' represent very different spans of time |

### Secondary concept: Local and National History (HI-KS1-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

History operates at different scales: the history of one's own locality connects personal and community identity to the broader national story, while national history provides the shared context within which local history is understood. The curriculum requires both local and national history at KS1, recognising that pupils' sense of historical belonging is rooted in the local even as they need to understand broader national narratives. Local history also provides access to primary sources and physical traces of the past that national history cannot always offer.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recalling a fact about a local historical event, person or place studied in class. | Confusing local history facts with general history knowledge; Not being able to recall any specific local historical detail |
| **Developing** | Describing a local historical event or feature and explaining how it connects to the wider area or community. | Describing the physical feature without explaining its historical or community significance; Not making connections between the local feature and the people who use it |
| **Expected** | Connecting local history to national history, explaining how a national event affected the local area or how a local story is part of a bigger picture. | Treating local and national history as completely separate topics; Describing the national event without connecting it to the specific local impact |

## Thinking lens: Continuity and Change Over Time (primary)

**Key question:** What has stayed the same, what has changed, and what drove that change?

**Why this lens fits:** This cluster is the foundational introduction to the most central historical thinking concept — pupils build the vocabulary of time and begin to distinguish what has changed from what has persisted within living memory, which is the cognitive essence of continuity_change reasoning.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What was it like long ago?
- What is the same now as it was then?
- What is different now?
- Can you put these in order: what happened first?

**Secondary lens:** Cause and Effect — Studying significant individuals asks pupils to trace the consequences of particular people's actions on events and society — why did this person matter? what changed because of what they did? — which is explicitly causal-chain reasoning applied to historical biography and local/national narrative.

## Session structure: Topic Study

### Topic Study
A structured enquiry into a defined topic, period, or place. Begins with an engaging hook to capture interest, builds contextual knowledge, moves through source analysis and interpretation, and culminates in a substantiated argument or conclusion. The core humanities template.

`hook` → `context` → `source_analysis` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Extended writing task presenting a reasoned argument supported by evidence from the topic. Can take the form of an essay, structured explanation, or debate position.

**Teacher note:** Use the TOPIC STUDY template: begin with a simple hook that captures children's curiosity — a picture, an object, or a short story. Provide context through visual and sensory experiences. Guide children to look at one source closely, describing what they can see. Ask them to say what they think it tells us, using 'I think... because...' sentences.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What can you see in this picture?
- What do you think this tells us about life long ago?
- What is the same as today? What is different?
- How do you know? What clues can you spot?

## Disciplinary concepts foregrounded

| Concept | Key question | Role in this study |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Change and Continuity | What changed, what stayed the same, and why? | At KS1, change and continuity means comparing 'then' and 'now' using real objects and photographs, asking 'What is the same? What is different?' |
| Chronology | When did this happen, and how does it fit into the wider timeline? | At KS1, chronology means ordering events on a simple timeline and using vocabulary like 'before', 'after', 'long ago', 'recently'. |
| Evidence and Interpretation | How do we know about this, and how do historians disagree? | At KS1, evidence means asking 'How do we know about this?' and using objects, photos, and people's memories as sources. |

---

## Why this study matters

This is the most accessible entry point for historical thinking at KS1: pupils can interview grandparents, compare photographs, and handle real objects from different decades. It grounds the abstract concept of 'the past' in their own family experience and develops chronological understanding through personally meaningful content.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Presenting all change as improvement rather than asking what was gained and what was lost
2. Treating oral testimony as just a fun activity rather than as historical source analysis
3. Choosing comparison objects that are too similar (two recent phones) rather than dramatically different (rotary phone vs smartphone)

## Sensitive content

- Some pupils may not have grandparents or may have difficult family circumstances; provide alternative sources of 'living memory'
- Changes within living memory may include traumatic events (war, displacement) for some families

## Historical thinking skills (KS1)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Chronological understanding** — Understand and use chronological frameworks to sequence events, periods and changes over time; develop a chronologically secure knowledge of British, local and world history using historical time vocabulary with increasing precision; construct and interpret timelines that place events in meaningful relation to each other.
- **Causation and consequence** — Understand why historical events and changes happened by identifying and explaining multiple causes; assess the intended and unintended consequences of events and decisions; distinguish between long-term structural factors and immediate triggers; construct causal arguments using historical evidence.
- **Change and continuity** — Identify what changed and what remained constant across historical periods; assess the pace, nature and extent of change; distinguish between long-term trends and short-term fluctuations; understand that change can be experienced differently by different groups within the same society.
- **Similarity and difference** — Identify and explain similarities and differences within and across historical periods, societies and cultures; avoid anachronism by understanding people's lives and choices within their own contexts; make valid comparisons that illuminate both the distinctiveness of periods and the common threads of human experience.
- **Historical significance** — Assess the significance of historical events, people and developments using explicit criteria such as scale of impact, duration, number of people affected, degree of change caused, and how an event is remembered and commemorated; understand that significance is not fixed but is constructed and contested by historians and societies over time.
- **Historical evidence** — Locate, select and use a range of primary and secondary historical sources; understand provenance and evaluate a source's utility and reliability in relation to a specific enquiry; corroborate claims across multiple sources; recognise that all sources are partial and that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
