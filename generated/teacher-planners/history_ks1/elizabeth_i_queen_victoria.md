## Enquiry questions

1. What was the same and what was different about being queen in Elizabeth I's time and Victoria's time?
2. Which queen do you think was more significant, and why?
3. What had changed in Britain between Elizabeth I's reign and Victoria's reign?

## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Significant Individuals and Their Impact (HI-KS1-C003)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

History includes the study of significant individuals whose actions, discoveries, decisions or achievements have had lasting consequences for other people and subsequent generations. Significance is determined by the scale and duration of impact, the extent to which an individual changed the course of events, and the degree to which they are remembered and commemorated. At KS1, pupils learn about significant individuals from different historical periods and contexts, comparing figures from different times to understand how contexts shape lives and possibilities.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce significant individuals through stories, photographs, artefacts and primary sources. Help pupils understand why each individual is significant: what did they do, and what difference did it make? Use paired comparisons specified in the curriculum (e.g., Florence Nightingale and Mary Seacole) to develop understanding of how context shapes significance and recognition. Discuss why some historical figures are well-known while others have been overlooked, introducing the idea that history involves selection and interpretation. Include significant individuals from diverse backgrounds, genders and cultures.

**Key vocabulary:** significant, achievement, contribution, impact, legacy, commemorate, famous, discover, invent, lead, inspire, pioneer, historical figure, biography

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may think significant individuals were born special rather than shaped by context and choices. Discussing the obstacles individuals faced develops understanding of the conditions that make significance possible. Pupils may not question why some historical figures are more prominent than others; discussing who decides which figures are remembered develops critical historical thinking. The distinction between fact (what we know happened) and opinion (how we judge its significance) is important to introduce early.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recalling basic facts about a significant individual studied in class: their name, when they lived, and one thing they did. | Tell me one thing you remember about Florence Nightingale. | Confusing details of different significant individuals studied; Remembering the story but not the person's name |
| **Developing** | Describing what a significant individual did and beginning to explain why their actions mattered to other people. | What did Mary Seacole do, and why was it important? | Describing actions without connecting them to their impact on others; Retelling the individual's story as a simple sequence without explaining significance |
| **Expected** | Explaining why an individual is considered significant by identifying the impact of their actions and comparing them with another individual. | Both Florence Nightingale and Mary Seacole helped soldiers in the Crimean War. How were their contributions similar and different? | Stating that one individual was 'better' than the other rather than comparing contributions; Focusing only on similarities or only on differences, not both |
| **Greater Depth** | Evaluating why some individuals are better remembered than others, considering factors such as bias, record-keeping and whose stories get told. | Florence Nightingale is more famous than Mary Seacole. Why might that be? Is fame the same as importance? | Equating fame with historical significance; Not considering that record-keeping and social factors affect who gets remembered |

> **Model response (Entry):** *Florence Nightingale helped sick soldiers in a hospital. She carried a lamp at night to check on them.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Mary Seacole travelled to the Crimean War to help injured soldiers. She set up a hotel near the battlefield where soldiers could get medicine and food. It was important because the soldiers needed help and she made them better.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Both helped sick and injured soldiers and both were brave to go to a war zone. Florence Nightingale worked in a hospital and changed how hospitals were kept clean. Mary Seacole went closer to the battlefield and paid for her own supplies. Florence Nightingale became more famous at the time, but both made a big difference.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *Florence Nightingale was more famous because she was written about more and came from a wealthy family, so more people heard about her. Mary Seacole faced prejudice because of her background. Being famous doesn't always mean being more important — Mary Seacole helped just as many soldiers but fewer people told her story.*

### Secondary concept: Time and Chronology (HI-KS1-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Chronology is the ordering of events and periods in time. Understanding chronology requires both the vocabulary of time (before, after, then, now, long ago, recently, past, present) and the ability to place events and people in sequence relative to each other. At KS1, pupils develop chronological understanding beginning with their own life histories and moving outwards to family memories, local history and national events. Placing events on timelines, sequencing pictures and comparing 'old' and 'new' versions of familiar objects are key activities that develop chronological awareness.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recognising and using basic time vocabulary (before, after, now, then, long ago) to describe the order of two events. | Using 'before' and 'after' interchangeably without distinguishing their meaning; Placing all events described as 'old' at the same point in the past |
| **Developing** | Sequencing three or more events or objects on a simple timeline, using vocabulary such as 'first', 'next', 'then', 'finally', 'a long time ago'. | Ordering by personal preference rather than chronological sequence; Placing the steam train after the car because trains are less familiar |
| **Expected** | Placing events, people and objects from different periods on a timeline and explaining how they know the order, using evidence from sources. | Placing objects in order of size or appearance rather than age; Not being able to explain the reasoning behind the sequence |
| **Greater Depth** | Using chronological understanding to explain that different periods of time varied in length, and that some changes happened quickly while others took a long time. | Assuming all historical change happens at the same pace; Struggling to grasp that 'hundreds of years' and '20 years' represent very different spans of time |

### Secondary concept: Change and Continuity (HI-KS1-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Historical change refers to the ways in which people's lives, beliefs, institutions and the world around them have transformed over time. Continuity refers to aspects that remain the same over long periods despite other changes. Understanding change and continuity requires pupils to identify what has changed, what has stayed the same, and to consider why some things change while others persist. At KS1, pupils explore change through comparing everyday objects, homes, transport and daily life across different time periods within living memory and beyond.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying one thing that has changed and one thing that has stayed the same when comparing old and new versions of a familiar object or setting. | Identifying only differences and not recognising any continuity; Focusing solely on colour differences in photographs rather than meaningful changes |
| **Developing** | Describing several changes and continuities between past and present in a familiar context, using comparative language. | Assuming everything in the past was completely different from today; Listing changes without using comparative language (older/newer, more/fewer) |
| **Expected** | Explaining why some things have changed while others have stayed the same, giving reasons linked to people's needs or new inventions. | Describing changes without offering any explanation for why they happened; Treating all change as automatic 'progress' rather than a response to needs |
| **Greater Depth** | Recognising that change can involve loss as well as gain, and that not everyone experiences change in the same way. | Viewing all historical change as purely positive progress; Struggling to imagine disadvantages of modern inventions |

## Thinking lens: Continuity and Change Over Time (primary)

**Key question:** What has stayed the same, what has changed, and what drove that change?

**Why this lens fits:** This cluster is the foundational introduction to the most central historical thinking concept — pupils build the vocabulary of time and begin to distinguish what has changed from what has persisted within living memory, which is the cognitive essence of continuity_change reasoning.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What was it like long ago?
- What is the same now as it was then?
- What is different now?
- Can you put these in order: what happened first?

**Secondary lens:** Cause and Effect — Studying significant individuals asks pupils to trace the consequences of particular people's actions on events and society — why did this person matter? what changed because of what they did? — which is explicitly causal-chain reasoning applied to historical biography and local/national narrative.

## Session structure: Topic Study + Comparison Study

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Topic Study (main structure)
A structured enquiry into a defined topic, period, or place. Begins with an engaging hook to capture interest, builds contextual knowledge, moves through source analysis and interpretation, and culminates in a substantiated argument or conclusion. The core humanities template.

`hook` → `context` → `source_analysis` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Extended writing task presenting a reasoned argument supported by evidence from the topic. Can take the form of an essay, structured explanation, or debate position.

**Teacher note:** Use the TOPIC STUDY template: begin with a simple hook that captures children's curiosity — a picture, an object, or a short story. Provide context through visual and sensory experiences. Guide children to look at one source closely, describing what they can see. Ask them to say what they think it tells us, using 'I think... because...' sentences.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What can you see in this picture?
- What do you think this tells us about life long ago?
- What is the same as today? What is different?
- How do you know? What clues can you spot?

### Comparison Study
A structured comparison of two or more examples, places, periods, or perspectives. Introduces each example with sufficient context, applies a systematic comparison framework, analyses similarities and differences with supporting evidence, and reaches an evaluative conclusion about the significance of those differences.

`introduce_examples` → `systematic_comparison` → `analysis` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Comparative analysis using a structured framework (table, Venn diagram, or essay), demonstrating understanding of both examples and reaching a substantiated evaluative conclusion.

## Primary sources

1 historically grounded source types are available for this study:

### 1. The Armada Portrait of Elizabeth I (Primary Visual, )
Attributed to George Gower, this portrait was painted to celebrate the defeat of the Spanish Armada. It shows Elizabeth with her hand on a globe, the English fleet behind her and the wrecked Armada in the other window. It is a piece of political propaganda designed to project power and divine favour.

**How to use:** At KS1: compare with portraits of Queen Victoria and ask 'What do these pictures tell us about how each queen wanted to be seen?' At KS3: analyse as propaganda -- what symbols of power does Elizabeth surround herself with, and what message is being sent? Who was the intended audience?

**Location:** Queen's House, Royal Museums Greenwich

## Disciplinary concepts foregrounded

| Concept | Key question | Role in this study |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Similarity and Difference | How was this similar to or different from other times, places, or peoples? | At KS1, compare two people who had the same role in different times. What was the same? What was different? |
| Chronology | When did this happen, and how does it fit into the wider timeline? | At KS1, place both queens on a timeline to show the large gap between their reigns. |
| Significance | Why does this matter, and to whom? | At KS1, ask 'What did each queen achieve?' and 'Why do we still remember them?' |

## Key figures and events

**Key figures:** Elizabeth I, Queen Victoria

**Key events:**
- Elizabeth's accession 1558
- Defeat of the Spanish Armada 1588
- Victoria's accession 1837
- Victoria becomes Empress of India 1876

**Period:** 1533-1901

**Perspectives to include:** Elizabeth I, Queen Victoria, subject in Tudor England, subject in Victorian Britain

**Significance claim:** Elizabeth I and Queen Victoria were two of Britain's most powerful and long-reigning monarchs, but they ruled in very different eras and contexts. Comparing them develops understanding of how the same role (queen) can mean different things in different periods.

---

## Why this study matters

This pairing is explicitly specified in the NC as a vehicle for comparing 'aspects of life in different periods'. The 300-year gap between them makes the comparison powerful for developing chronological understanding. Both are significant figures, but the comparison reveals how much Britain changed between the Tudor and Victorian periods.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Reducing the comparison to surface-level differences (clothes, buildings) rather than exploring how the role of monarch changed
2. Not helping pupils understand the enormous chronological gap between the two queens

---

## Cross-curricular opportunities

| Link | Subject | Connection | Strength |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| Information Text: All About Animals | English | Writing factual comparisons using comparison language (both, but, however) | Strong |
| Self-Portraits | Art and Design | Comparing portraits of both queens: what do the portraits tell us about how they wanted to be seen? | Strong |

## Historical thinking skills (KS1)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Chronological understanding** — Understand and use chronological frameworks to sequence events, periods and changes over time; develop a chronologically secure knowledge of British, local and world history using historical time vocabulary with increasing precision; construct and interpret timelines that place events in meaningful relation to each other.
- **Causation and consequence** — Understand why historical events and changes happened by identifying and explaining multiple causes; assess the intended and unintended consequences of events and decisions; distinguish between long-term structural factors and immediate triggers; construct causal arguments using historical evidence.
- **Change and continuity** — Identify what changed and what remained constant across historical periods; assess the pace, nature and extent of change; distinguish between long-term trends and short-term fluctuations; understand that change can be experienced differently by different groups within the same society.
- **Similarity and difference** — Identify and explain similarities and differences within and across historical periods, societies and cultures; avoid anachronism by understanding people's lives and choices within their own contexts; make valid comparisons that illuminate both the distinctiveness of periods and the common threads of human experience.
- **Historical significance** — Assess the significance of historical events, people and developments using explicit criteria such as scale of impact, duration, number of people affected, degree of change caused, and how an event is remembered and commemorated; understand that significance is not fixed but is constructed and contested by historians and societies over time.
- **Historical evidence** — Locate, select and use a range of primary and secondary historical sources; understand provenance and evaluate a source's utility and reliability in relation to a specific enquiry; corroborate claims across multiple sources; recognise that all sources are partial and that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
