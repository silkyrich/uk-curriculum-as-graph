## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Materials Science and Properties (DT-KS3-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Materials science is the study of the properties of materials - physical, mechanical, thermal, electrical, chemical and aesthetic - and how these properties determine the suitability of materials for specific applications. At KS3, pupils develop systematic understanding of the properties of a range of materials including metals, polymers, wood-based materials, ceramics, composites and smart materials. Understanding properties enables pupils to make informed material selection decisions and to understand why materials behave as they do under different conditions and manufacturing processes.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach properties systematically with practical testing activities: compare strength, flexibility, conductivity, thermal properties of different materials. Study how manufacturing processes alter properties: how does heat treatment change metal? How does grain direction affect wood? Investigate smart and composite materials: shape-memory alloys, carbon fibre, Kevlar. Connect material choice to product examples: why is this product made from this material? What would change if a different material were used? Use material data sheets as professional reference tools.

**Key vocabulary:** property, material, strength, stiffness, ductility, malleability, conductivity, thermal, density, composite, smart material, alloy, polymer, ceramic, corrosion

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may have oversimplified mental models of materials (metal = hard, plastic = soft) that do not account for the enormous range within each material category. Systematic comparison activities challenge these generalisations. The distinction between material properties (inherent characteristics) and manufacturing properties (how easily a material can be shaped) is important but often conflated. Smart materials may seem magical; explaining the underlying scientific principles demystifies them.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can name some materials (wood, metal, plastic) and describe basic properties such as hard, soft or flexible, but struggles to explain why a specific material is chosen for a specific purpose. | Why are saucepan handles usually made from plastic or wood rather than metal? | Saying 'because metal gets hot' without explaining the concept of thermal conductivity; Not recognising that the choice relates to material properties, not just tradition |
| **Developing** | Understands categories of materials and their general properties, and can select appropriate materials for simple products by matching properties to requirements. | You need to choose a material for a protective phone case. Compare two possible materials — silicone rubber and polycarbonate plastic — and recommend one, giving reasons. | Choosing a material based on personal preference rather than comparing properties against requirements; Not considering that different users might have different protection priorities |
| **Secure** | Systematically evaluates materials against multiple criteria including functional performance, aesthetics, cost, environmental impact and manufacturing compatibility, using a selection matrix approach. | You are designing a reusable food container. Create a materials selection matrix comparing three candidate materials against at least four criteria, and justify your final choice. | Including only one or two criteria rather than considering multiple requirements simultaneously; Not acknowledging that different weightings of criteria could change the recommendation |
| **Mastery** | Applies advanced materials knowledge including smart materials and composites, evaluates how material properties interact with manufacturing processes, and considers the full lifecycle of material choices. | A sports equipment company wants to replace aluminium with a composite material in a tennis racket frame. Evaluate this decision considering performance, manufacturing and sustainability. | Focusing only on performance improvements without considering manufacturing constraints and environmental costs; Not recognising that the recyclability difference between metals and composites is a significant sustainability issue |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Metal conducts heat, so a metal handle would get too hot to hold. Plastic and wood are thermal insulators, meaning they do not conduct heat well, so they stay cool enough to grip safely.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Silicone rubber is soft, flexible and has high impact absorption, so it cushions the phone when dropped. Polycarbonate is rigid, hard and scratch-resistant, so it protects against abrasion and crushing. I would recommend silicone for users who frequently drop their phone, because its flexibility absorbs shock energy. I would recommend polycarbonate for users who carry their phone in a bag with keys, because its hardness resists scratching. Both are lightweight and can be moulded into shape. The choice depends on which type of damage the user is most likely to encounter.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Criteria: food safety, durability, weight, environmental impact, cost. Materials: borosilicate glass, polypropylene (PP), stainless steel. Food safety: all three are food-safe (score 5, 5, 5). Durability: glass is fragile (2), PP is durable and flexible (4), steel is very durable (5). Weight: glass is heavy (2), PP is very light (5), steel is moderate (3). Environmental impact: glass is recyclable and inert (4), PP is recyclable but derived from oil (3), steel is highly recyclable and lasts decades (4). Cost: glass moderate (3), PP low (5), steel high (2). Total scores: glass 16, PP 22, steel 19. I recommend polypropylene for everyday use because it scores highest overall, especially on weight and cost. However, if the user prioritises longevity over weight, stainless steel is better despite higher cost.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) would replace aluminium with significant performance benefits: it has a higher strength-to-weight ratio (the racket would be lighter but equally strong), greater stiffness (less energy lost in frame flex during hitting), and better vibration damping (reducing arm strain). However, there are manufacturing trade-offs: CFRP requires specialist lay-up and autoclaving processes that are more expensive and slower than aluminium extrusion, making it unsuitable for budget rackets. Sustainability is the critical weakness: aluminium is highly recyclable (melted and reused indefinitely with minimal quality loss), while CFRP is extremely difficult to recycle — the thermoset resin cannot be re-melted, so end-of-life rackets typically go to landfill. The carbon fibre production process itself is energy-intensive. A responsible design decision would need to weigh the performance gains against the environmental cost, and might consider recyclable thermoplastic composites as an emerging alternative that offers some of CFRP's performance with better end-of-life options.*

### Secondary concept: User-Centred Design (DT-KS3-C001)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

User-centred design is a design philosophy and process that places the needs, capabilities, preferences and context of intended users at the centre of every design decision. It involves deep empathy with users, structured research methods (interviews, observation, surveys, prototyping), iterative testing with real users, and continuous refinement based on user feedback. At KS3, pupils develop understanding of user-centred design as a distinct and powerful approach that produces solutions better suited to genuine human needs than solutions derived purely from technical or aesthetic assumptions.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Recognises that designers should think about who will use a product, but relies on personal assumptions rather than structured research to identify user needs. | Listing features they personally want rather than questions about user needs; Focusing only on appearance rather than functional requirements |
| **Developing** | Can describe user-centred design methods such as interviews and observation, and begins to use them to create a basic design specification, though research may be shallow. | Writing leading questions that assume a solution (e.g., 'Would you like a bigger handle?'); Not explaining how the information gathered would inform specific design decisions |
| **Secure** | Conducts structured user research, develops user personas, translates findings into measurable design criteria, and uses iterative prototyping to test ideas with real users. | Skipping the observation and interview stages and jumping straight to designing based on assumptions; Creating a prototype but not testing it with actual users in the real context of use |
| **Mastery** | Critically evaluates competing user needs and design trade-offs, applies professional design thinking frameworks, and justifies design decisions with reference to user research evidence. | Simply choosing one user group over the other rather than seeking an inclusive solution; Not referencing real-world examples of inclusive design that resolve similar tensions |

### Secondary concept: Specialist Making Processes and CAM (DT-KS3-C005)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

At KS3, making extends beyond hand tool skills to encompass specialist processes — including laser cutting, CNC routing, 3D printing, vacuum forming, heat bending, laminating and computer-aided manufacture (CAM) — that are used in professional design and manufacturing contexts. Understanding which processes are appropriate for specific materials and design outcomes, and developing competence in executing them precisely, is the central challenge of the make domain at KS3. Pupils also develop understanding that making is not a one-pass process but an iterative one: encountering problems during making often requires returning to the design to adapt it.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can use basic hand tools safely with guidance and follows step-by-step making instructions, but does not independently select tools or processes for a given task. | Suggesting a wood saw, which would crack the acrylic due to inappropriate tooth pattern; Not mentioning clamping or securing the workpiece before cutting |
| **Developing** | Can select appropriate tools and processes for different materials, understands the link between CAD files and CAM output, and works with reasonable precision. | Using a raster image format (JPEG, PNG) instead of a vector format; Not checking that the design is at actual size (1:1 scale) before sending to the machine |
| **Secure** | Selects and uses specialist tools and CAM processes competently, adapts making approaches when problems arise, and applies quality control checks throughout the making process. | Trying to fix the gap with adhesive rather than diagnosing and correcting the root cause; Not testing the correction on scrap material before committing to a full re-cut |
| **Mastery** | Combines hand and digital manufacturing processes strategically, understands industrial manufacturing contexts, and evaluates when CAM offers genuine advantages over hand making. | Recommending only CNC or only hand making without considering a hybrid approach; Not considering the setup time and cost investment required for CNC production |

## Thinking lens: Perspective and Interpretation (primary)

**Key question:** Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?

**Why this lens fits:** User-centred design is built on the systematic practice of adopting the user's perspective — empathy mapping, user journey analysis and prototype testing with real users all require pupils to interpret the design problem through someone else's lived experience.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- What contextual factors shaped this perspective?
- How does the author's position affect the reliability of this account?
- Whose perspective is missing from this record, and why does that matter?
- How have interpretations of this event changed over time, and what drove those changes?

**Secondary lens:** Structure and Function — Selecting the right material for a complex product and the right specialist process to work it (laser cutting sheet acrylic, CNC routing MDF) requires reasoning about how the material's structure enables or constrains the chosen manufacturing process and the product's eventual function.

## Session structure: Design, Make, Evaluate

### Design, Make, Evaluate
The core Design & Technology cycle. Pupils investigate existing products and user needs, design a solution with clear specifications, plan the making process, construct using appropriate materials and techniques, test against the design brief, and evaluate the outcome with suggestions for improvement.

`investigate` → `design` → `plan` → `make` → `test` → `evaluate`

**Assessment:** Design portfolio including investigation findings, annotated design with specifications, making log, test results, and evaluative conclusion comparing outcome to original brief.

**Teacher note:** Use the DESIGN, MAKE AND EVALUATE template: investigate the context, users, and existing solutions before designing. Expect detailed design development with annotation explaining choices of material, construction, and finish. Guide making with attention to precision, quality of finish, and safe use of tools. Demand evaluation against the specification that identifies strengths, weaknesses, and potential improvements.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How have you used your investigation of existing products to inform your design?
- What are the strengths of your chosen materials and construction methods?
- How does the quality of your making compare with your design intentions?
- How would you improve your product based on testing and evaluation?

## Design and Technology: Resistant Materials

**Design brief:** Design and make a stand that holds a phone or tablet at a comfortable viewing angle for desk use. The stand must be stable, well-finished, and designed with ergonomics in mind. Research existing products first and write a design specification.

**Materials:** pine or MDF, acrylic sheet, aluminium bar, PVA glue or epoxy, abrasive papers (various grades), finish (lacquer, wax, or polish)
**Tools:** tenon saw, coping saw, files (flat, half-round), pillar drill (teacher supervised), disc sander (teacher supervised), try square, steel rule, marking gauge
**Techniques:** accurate marking out from a datum edge, sawing to a line, filing to shape, drilling pilot and clearance holes, surface finishing progression (coarse to fine), assembly with appropriate adhesive
**Safety notes:** Pillar drill and disc sander: teacher-supervised, one pupil at a time, hair tied back, safety glasses mandatory. Tenon saw: clamp workpiece securely in vice before cutting. Acrylic: score-and-snap method preferred; if sawing, use fine-tooth blade to prevent cracking. All sharp edges must be removed before handling.

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Does it hold the device at a stable, comfortable angle?
- Is the surface finish smooth and well-presented?
- Does the design reflect the specification?
- Is the stand stable on a flat surface?

## Why this study matters

A phone or tablet stand is a small, achievable resistant materials project that introduces marking out, cutting, shaping and finishing in wood, metal or acrylic. The product has an immediate real-world use that motivates quality finishing. The design challenge -- holding a device at a comfortable viewing angle while being stable -- naturally introduces ergonomics and basic structural analysis. Pupils can apply CAD to generate a template before making.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Angle too steep or too shallow -- prototype with card first and test with an actual device
2. Stand not stable enough -- base must be wider and heavier than the supported device
3. Poor surface finish -- teach the progression from coarse to fine abrasive, then polish or lacquer
