## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Material Selection for Complex Products (DT-KS3-C006)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Selecting materials for complex products at KS3 requires systematic evaluation of a wider range of materials — including metals, polymers, wood-based materials, composites, textiles, smart materials and electronic components — against multiple criteria simultaneously: functional performance, aesthetic requirements, cost, availability, environmental impact, and compatibility with available making processes. The increased complexity of KS3 products means that multiple materials are often combined, requiring understanding of how materials interact with each other and with making processes.

**Teaching guidance:** Develop a materials selection matrix approach: list requirements on one axis, candidate materials on the other, score each material against each requirement, and select the material with the highest combined score. Investigate how composite materials combine properties from different constituent materials. Study materials data sheets and supplier catalogues as real-world selection tools. Set open material selection tasks where pupils must research, compare and justify their material choices for complex multi-material products. Connect material selection to sustainability: what is the environmental cost of different material choices?

**Key vocabulary:** material, composite, polymer, metal, alloy, wood, textile, smart material, selection, criteria, property, process, compatibility, sustainability, specification

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may select familiar materials rather than the most appropriate ones. Systematic matrix-based selection challenges habitual choosing. The idea that different materials in a single product must be compatible with the same making processes can be missed; teaching pupils to consider how each part will be made alongside what it will be made from prevents this.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Tends to choose familiar materials (usually wood or card) for all projects without considering whether the material's properties match the product's requirements. | You are making a waterproof container for outdoor use. Explain why wood might not be the best choice and suggest a better material. | Saying wood is fine if you 'paint it' without recognising that paint chips and the wood underneath still absorbs moisture; Not explaining why the alternative material is specifically better for this application |
| **Developing** | Can compare materials across multiple properties and select materials that meet basic functional and aesthetic requirements for a given product. | Choose a material for a kitchen spatula. It must be heat-resistant, food-safe and flexible. Compare two options and justify your choice. | Choosing based on cost alone without considering whether the material meets all functional requirements; Not specifying the actual temperature resistance of the materials |
| **Secure** | Uses systematic multi-criteria evaluation to select materials, considers how materials interact with manufacturing processes, and evaluates material combinations in multi-material products. | Design a desk lamp that uses at least three different materials. For each material, explain why it was selected and how it will be manufactured. | Choosing materials without explaining the specific properties that make them suitable; Not considering how different materials will be joined together in the final product |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates advanced materials including composites and smart materials, assesses lifecycle environmental impact of material choices, and makes design decisions that balance competing requirements across performance, cost and sustainability. | A product designer proposes using carbon fibre for a bicycle frame aimed at commuters. Evaluate this choice considering the target market, manufacturing and end-of-life. | Assuming that the lightest and strongest material is always the best choice regardless of context; Not considering the end-of-life recyclability difference between thermoplastic and thermoset materials |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Wood absorbs water over time, which would cause it to swell, warp and eventually rot, making it unsuitable for a waterproof container used outdoors. A better choice would be high-density polyethylene (HDPE) because it is waterproof, does not rot, is lightweight and is resistant to UV damage from sunlight.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Option 1: Silicone — heat resistant to 230 degrees C, food-safe (FDA approved), flexible enough to scrape bowls, easy to clean, does not scratch non-stick pans. Option 2: Nylon — heat resistant to about 200 degrees C, food-safe, semi-flexible, cheaper than silicone but can melt if left on a hot pan. I would choose silicone because it has a higher heat resistance (safer if accidentally left near heat), is more flexible for scraping, and will not damage non-stick coatings.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Base: cast iron — chosen for its high density (provides stability to prevent tipping), can be sand-cast into a decorative shape, and has a premium aesthetic. Manufacturing: sand casting followed by powder coating for colour and corrosion resistance. Arm: aluminium tube — chosen for its light weight (keeps centre of gravity low), corrosion resistance, and ease of bending to shape. Manufacturing: extruded aluminium tube, bent using a tube bender to the required angle. Shade: 3D-printed PLA — chosen because it allows complex geometric patterns that cast interesting light shadows, can be customised for each customer, and PLA is biodegradable. Manufacturing: FDM 3D printing with 15% infill for light diffusion. Material compatibility: the cast iron base connects to the aluminium arm using a threaded steel bolt (compatible metals joined mechanically); the PLA shade clips onto the aluminium arm using a friction-fit socket designed to be easily replaced.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Carbon fibre would make the frame extremely light and stiff — excellent performance properties. However, for a commuter bicycle (rather than a racing bicycle), this is over-engineered: commuters prioritise reliability, cost and damage tolerance over minimal weight. Carbon fibre is brittle and can crack invisibly on impact (from bike racks, falls), creating a hidden safety risk — unlike aluminium or steel which deform visibly before failing. Manufacturing: carbon fibre lay-up is labour-intensive and expensive, making the frame cost-prohibitive for the commuter market segment. Each frame requires a mould, making small production runs expensive. Environmental: carbon fibre production is energy-intensive and the thermoset resin means frames cannot be recycled — they go to landfill. A steel or aluminium frame is infinitely recyclable. Recommendation: use 6061-T6 aluminium alloy for the commuter frame — it is light enough for daily commuting, dents rather than cracks (visible damage, safer), is inexpensive to hydroform or weld in production, and is 100% recyclable at end of life. Reserve carbon fibre for the premium racing market where its weight advantage justifies the cost and sustainability trade-offs.*

### Secondary concept: User-Centred Design (DT-KS3-C001)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

User-centred design is a design philosophy and process that places the needs, capabilities, preferences and context of intended users at the centre of every design decision. It involves deep empathy with users, structured research methods (interviews, observation, surveys, prototyping), iterative testing with real users, and continuous refinement based on user feedback. At KS3, pupils develop understanding of user-centred design as a distinct and powerful approach that produces solutions better suited to genuine human needs than solutions derived purely from technical or aesthetic assumptions.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Recognises that designers should think about who will use a product, but relies on personal assumptions rather than structured research to identify user needs. | Listing features they personally want rather than questions about user needs; Focusing only on appearance rather than functional requirements |
| **Developing** | Can describe user-centred design methods such as interviews and observation, and begins to use them to create a basic design specification, though research may be shallow. | Writing leading questions that assume a solution (e.g., 'Would you like a bigger handle?'); Not explaining how the information gathered would inform specific design decisions |
| **Secure** | Conducts structured user research, develops user personas, translates findings into measurable design criteria, and uses iterative prototyping to test ideas with real users. | Skipping the observation and interview stages and jumping straight to designing based on assumptions; Creating a prototype but not testing it with actual users in the real context of use |
| **Mastery** | Critically evaluates competing user needs and design trade-offs, applies professional design thinking frameworks, and justifies design decisions with reference to user research evidence. | Simply choosing one user group over the other rather than seeking an inclusive solution; Not referencing real-world examples of inclusive design that resolve similar tensions |

### Secondary concept: Specialist Making Processes and CAM (DT-KS3-C005)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

At KS3, making extends beyond hand tool skills to encompass specialist processes — including laser cutting, CNC routing, 3D printing, vacuum forming, heat bending, laminating and computer-aided manufacture (CAM) — that are used in professional design and manufacturing contexts. Understanding which processes are appropriate for specific materials and design outcomes, and developing competence in executing them precisely, is the central challenge of the make domain at KS3. Pupils also develop understanding that making is not a one-pass process but an iterative one: encountering problems during making often requires returning to the design to adapt it.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can use basic hand tools safely with guidance and follows step-by-step making instructions, but does not independently select tools or processes for a given task. | Suggesting a wood saw, which would crack the acrylic due to inappropriate tooth pattern; Not mentioning clamping or securing the workpiece before cutting |
| **Developing** | Can select appropriate tools and processes for different materials, understands the link between CAD files and CAM output, and works with reasonable precision. | Using a raster image format (JPEG, PNG) instead of a vector format; Not checking that the design is at actual size (1:1 scale) before sending to the machine |
| **Secure** | Selects and uses specialist tools and CAM processes competently, adapts making approaches when problems arise, and applies quality control checks throughout the making process. | Trying to fix the gap with adhesive rather than diagnosing and correcting the root cause; Not testing the correction on scrap material before committing to a full re-cut |
| **Mastery** | Combines hand and digital manufacturing processes strategically, understands industrial manufacturing contexts, and evaluates when CAM offers genuine advantages over hand making. | Recommending only CNC or only hand making without considering a hybrid approach; Not considering the setup time and cost investment required for CNC production |

## Thinking lens: Perspective and Interpretation (primary)

**Key question:** Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?

**Why this lens fits:** User-centred design is built on the systematic practice of adopting the user's perspective — empathy mapping, user journey analysis and prototype testing with real users all require pupils to interpret the design problem through someone else's lived experience.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- What contextual factors shaped this perspective?
- How does the author's position affect the reliability of this account?
- Whose perspective is missing from this record, and why does that matter?
- How have interpretations of this event changed over time, and what drove those changes?

**Secondary lens:** Structure and Function — Selecting the right material for a complex product and the right specialist process to work it (laser cutting sheet acrylic, CNC routing MDF) requires reasoning about how the material's structure enables or constrains the chosen manufacturing process and the product's eventual function.

## Session structure: Design, Make, Evaluate

### Design, Make, Evaluate
The core Design & Technology cycle. Pupils investigate existing products and user needs, design a solution with clear specifications, plan the making process, construct using appropriate materials and techniques, test against the design brief, and evaluate the outcome with suggestions for improvement.

`investigate` → `design` → `plan` → `make` → `test` → `evaluate`

**Assessment:** Design portfolio including investigation findings, annotated design with specifications, making log, test results, and evaluative conclusion comparing outcome to original brief.

**Teacher note:** Use the DESIGN, MAKE AND EVALUATE template: investigate the context, users, and existing solutions before designing. Expect detailed design development with annotation explaining choices of material, construction, and finish. Guide making with attention to precision, quality of finish, and safe use of tools. Demand evaluation against the specification that identifies strengths, weaknesses, and potential improvements.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How have you used your investigation of existing products to inform your design?
- What are the strengths of your chosen materials and construction methods?
- How does the quality of your making compare with your design intentions?
- How would you improve your product based on testing and evaluation?

## Design and Technology: Textiles

**Design brief:** Design and make a drawstring bag for a specific user (e.g. gym bag, book bag, toiletries bag). The bag must be functional, use at least one surface decoration technique, and reflect the user's needs and preferences identified through research.

**Materials:** cotton fabric, lining fabric, cord or ribbon for drawstring, fabric paints or printing inks, fusible web (for applique), embroidery threads
**Tools:** sewing machine, fabric scissors, pins and pin cushion, tape measure, fabric markers, iron (teacher supervised), seam ripper
**Techniques:** machine sewing (straight stitch, backstitch at start/end), creating a drawstring channel, fabric printing or applique, pressing seams flat, finishing edges
**Safety notes:** Sewing machine: demonstrate threading, needle guard, and finger placement before use. Iron: teacher-supervised only at Y7 -- demonstrate safe positioning and always return to stand. Pins: count before and after use; use pin cushion. Fabric scissors: dedicated textile scissors to maintain blade quality.

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Does the drawstring open and close smoothly?
- Are the seams straight and strong?
- Does the surface decoration enhance the design?
- Does the product meet the user's identified needs?

---

## Why this study matters

A drawstring bag introduces secondary textiles skills: using a sewing machine, working with multiple fabric layers, and applying surface decoration techniques (applique, fabric printing, embroidery). The design brief requires pupils to research a target user and create a product that meets specific functional and aesthetic requirements. This project builds directly on KS2 hand-sewing and introduces the precision and speed of machine-sewn construction.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Not threading the sewing machine correctly -- the top thread and bobbin must be correctly tensioned or stitches skip
2. Seam allowance inconsistent -- teach the 1.5cm seam guide on the machine and practice on scrap fabric first
3. Surface decoration applied after construction -- plan and apply decoration before sewing pieces together
