## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Advanced Cooking Techniques and Culinary Skills (DT-KS3-C008)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Advanced cooking techniques at KS3 extend pupils' practical competence to include a broader repertoire of preparation and cooking methods across different food categories and cuisines. These include more complex knife skills (julienne, chiffonade, dicing), a range of heat application methods (sautéing, braising, roasting, poaching, steaming), and techniques for improving flavour, texture and presentation (seasoning, reduction, garnishing, emulsification). Developing a repertoire of competent cooking techniques enables pupils to prepare a wide variety of dishes that support a healthy, varied diet.

**Teaching guidance:** Build cooking technique competence progressively across KS3, setting dishes that require new techniques while revisiting and consolidating earlier ones. Develop sensory evaluation skills: taste, smell, texture and visual assessment are important tools for a cook. Teach seasoning and flavour development as skills, not afterthoughts. Introduce multi-component dishes that require coordination of timing and technique. Connect cooking techniques to science: what happens to proteins when heated? Why does bread rise? How does an emulsion hold together? Emphasise food safety and hygiene as non-negotiable throughout.

**Key vocabulary:** technique, knife skill, sauté, braise, roast, poach, steam, season, reduce, emulsify, garnish, texture, flavour, aroma, preparation

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may approach cooking as recipe-following rather than skill development, missing the transferable technique knowledge that allows them to cook without a recipe. Framing each cooking session as practising a specific technique, not just making a specific dish, develops this broader competence. Pupils may underestimate the importance of preparation (mise en place) to a smooth cooking process; practising organised preparation as a skill in itself addresses this.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can follow a recipe to prepare a simple dish with support, but does not understand why specific techniques are used or how to adapt if something goes wrong. | You are making a stir-fry. Why is it important to cut all the vegetables into small, similar-sized pieces before you start cooking? | Thinking it is just about appearance rather than even cooking; Not understanding that stir-frying uses high heat for a short time, so uniform size is critical |
| **Developing** | Can execute a range of cooking techniques (boiling, frying, baking, grilling) with reasonable competence and understands the basic science behind them (e.g., heat causes proteins to denature). | Explain the difference between sauteing and deep-frying. When would you use each technique? | Confusing sauteing with shallow frying (shallow frying uses more oil and food is not moved constantly); Not explaining the scientific reason why deep-fried food has a crispy exterior (moisture evaporation and surface sealing) |
| **Secure** | Coordinates multiple cooking techniques within a single multi-component dish, uses sensory evaluation to adjust seasoning and timing, and understands the food science behind technique choices. | You are making a chicken pie from scratch. Plan the order of preparation, explaining why timing and technique matter at each stage. | Not chilling the pastry before rolling, leading to shrinkage and tough texture; Putting hot filling into the pastry case, which melts the fat and produces a soggy bottom |
| **Mastery** | Adapts techniques creatively, understands the science well enough to diagnose and fix problems, and can develop recipes independently based on knowledge of how ingredients behave. | Your hollandaise sauce has split (the butter and egg have separated into an oily, curdled mess). Explain the science behind why this happened and describe two methods to rescue it. | Not understanding that hollandaise is an emulsion (a mixture of two liquids that do not normally mix); Attempting to rescue by adding more butter, which makes the problem worse by adding more fat without more emulsifier |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Cutting vegetables into small, similar-sized pieces ensures they all cook at the same rate. If some pieces are large and some small, the small ones will overcook and go mushy while the large ones are still raw inside.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Sauteing uses a small amount of oil in a wide pan over high heat. Food is cut small and moved constantly so it cooks quickly and develops a golden colour from the Maillard reaction without absorbing much oil. It is used for vegetables, strips of meat and aromatics. Deep-frying submerges food completely in hot oil (typically 170-190 degrees C). The high temperature instantly seals the surface, creating a crispy coating while the interior steams and cooks through. It is used for battered fish, chips and doughnuts. I would saute when I want a quick, healthy result with fresh flavour, and deep-fry when I want a crispy texture as the main feature of the dish.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Stage 1 — Pastry first: make shortcrust pastry (rub cold butter into flour to create a breadcrumb texture — the fat coats flour particles, preventing gluten development, which keeps the pastry short and crumbly). Wrap in cling film and chill for 30 minutes (this relaxes the gluten, preventing shrinkage during baking, and firms the fat for easier rolling). Stage 2 — While pastry chills, prepare the filling: dice chicken and saute in a hot pan to brown the surface (Maillard reaction develops flavour). Remove chicken. Saute diced onion, celery and carrot in the same pan (using the residual fond for extra flavour). Stage 3 — Make a roux sauce: melt butter, stir in flour, cook for 2 minutes (cooking out the raw flour taste), then gradually add chicken stock while stirring continuously to prevent lumps (the starch gelatinises as it absorbs liquid, thickening the sauce). Return the chicken, season with salt, pepper and thyme. Taste and adjust. Cool the filling before filling the pie (hot filling would melt the pastry before it has time to set in the oven). Stage 4 — Roll out pastry, fill, seal edges, egg wash (for colour), and bake at 200 degrees C until golden.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Hollandaise is an emulsion: microscopic droplets of melted butter are suspended in a continuous phase of egg yolk and lemon juice. The lecithin in egg yolk acts as an emulsifier, coating each fat droplet and preventing them from merging. Splitting occurs when the emulsion breaks — the fat droplets merge back together and separate from the water phase. This happens if: the butter was added too quickly (overwhelming the emulsifier's capacity), the temperature was too high (the egg proteins coagulated, destroying the emulsifier network), or the mixture was not whisked vigorously enough. Rescue method 1: Start a fresh egg yolk in a clean bowl. Whisk it over gentle heat, then very slowly drizzle the split sauce into the new yolk while whisking constantly. The fresh lecithin re-emulsifies the mixture. Rescue method 2: Add a tablespoon of cold water to the split sauce and whisk vigorously. The cold water lowers the temperature and provides a new water phase for the fat droplets to disperse into. If this does not work, combine methods: whisk the cold water into a fresh yolk, then slowly incorporate the split sauce.*

### Secondary concept: Nutrition Science and Dietary Planning (DT-KS3-C007)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Nutrition science is the study of how the nutrients contained in food — macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, fats) and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals) — are used by the body to maintain health, support growth and provide energy. At KS3, pupils develop beyond basic food group awareness to understand the specific roles of macronutrients and key micronutrients, the consequences of nutritional deficiency or excess, and how to plan a diet that meets individual nutritional needs. This knowledge underpins the ability to make informed food choices and to prepare nutritionally appropriate meals.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that food contains nutrients needed for health and can name some basic food groups, but cannot explain the specific roles of macronutrients or micronutrients in the body. | Confusing macronutrients with food groups (e.g., saying 'fruit and vegetables' is a macronutrient); Not being able to name all three macronutrients |
| **Developing** | Can explain the main functions of macronutrients and some key micronutrients, and understands that a balanced diet provides all nutrients in appropriate quantities. | Saying athletes need protein 'for energy' — protein is primarily for growth and repair, not the main energy source; Not distinguishing between animal and plant protein sources |
| **Secure** | Plans nutritionally balanced meals using knowledge of macronutrient and micronutrient functions, analyses nutritional content using food labels and data, and understands the consequences of deficiency or excess. | Not addressing the reduced iron absorption from plant sources or the need for vitamin C pairing; Relying on a single protein source rather than combining complementary plant proteins |
| **Mastery** | Critically evaluates nutritional advice and dietary trends using evidence-based nutritional science, and applies nutrition knowledge to design diets for specific health conditions or life stages. | Accepting or rejecting the diet without explaining the underlying nutritional science; Not distinguishing between refined and complex carbohydrates in the evaluation |

## Thinking lens: Systems and System Models (primary)

**Key question:** What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?

**Why this lens fits:** Nutrition science at KS3 requires pupils to model the human body as a system with specific nutrient requirements — understanding how deficiencies or excesses in one nutrient affect the whole system underpins the analytical demands of this cluster.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- What feedback loops exist in this system?
- Does this model capture all the important interactions, or does it oversimplify?
- What emergent property arises from these components interacting?
- How would removing or adding a component change the system's behaviour?

**Secondary lens:** Cause and Effect — Advanced cooking techniques are applied because specific heat and chemical processes cause desired transformations in food — emulsification, Maillard reactions, gelatinisation — and pupils must understand the causal mechanism to select and execute techniques effectively.

## Session structure: Design, Make, Evaluate

### Design, Make, Evaluate
The core Design & Technology cycle. Pupils investigate existing products and user needs, design a solution with clear specifications, plan the making process, construct using appropriate materials and techniques, test against the design brief, and evaluate the outcome with suggestions for improvement.

`investigate` → `design` → `plan` → `make` → `test` → `evaluate`

**Assessment:** Design portfolio including investigation findings, annotated design with specifications, making log, test results, and evaluative conclusion comparing outcome to original brief.

**Teacher note:** Use the DESIGN, MAKE AND EVALUATE template: investigate the context, users, and existing solutions before designing. Expect detailed design development with annotation explaining choices of material, construction, and finish. Guide making with attention to precision, quality of finish, and safe use of tools. Demand evaluation against the specification that identifies strengths, weaknesses, and potential improvements.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How have you used your investigation of existing products to inform your design?
- What are the strengths of your chosen materials and construction methods?
- How does the quality of your making compare with your design intentions?
- How would you improve your product based on testing and evaluation?

## Design and Technology: Cooking And Nutrition

**Design brief:** Develop and make two contrasting baked products that demonstrate your understanding of how ingredients function: one using yeast (biological raising agent) and one using chemical raising agents (baking powder/bicarbonate of soda). Explain the food science behind each product.

**Materials:** strong bread flour, plain flour, butter, yeast (dried and fresh), baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, eggs, sugar, milk
**Tools:** mixing bowls, measuring scales, baking trays and tins, oven (teacher supervised), rolling pin, proving drawer or warm area, cooling racks
**Techniques:** kneading for gluten development, proving dough, laminating pastry (rough puff), creaming method, all-in-one method, testing for doneness
**Safety notes:** Oven: teacher-supervised. Hot baking trays: oven gloves mandatory. Flour dust: ensure good ventilation (asthma trigger). Check gluten, dairy, and egg allergies. Hand-washing before all food preparation. Clean as you go: demonstrated and enforced.

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Do both products demonstrate understanding of raising agents?
- Can you explain the food science behind each product?
- Are the products well-risen and properly baked?
- Is the presentation appealing?
**Food allergens:** gluten (flour), dairy (butter, milk), egg
**Food skills:** kneading, proving, laminating, creaming, baking, food science analysis

## Why this study matters

Building on KS2 bread-making, this unit develops understanding of the science behind baking: how gluten develops through kneading, how yeast fermentation produces CO2, how different flours and fats produce different textures. Pupils make enriched doughs (brioche, focaccia), laminated pastry (rough puff), and understand the science of raising agents (yeast vs chemical leavening). This is the foundation for understanding food science at GCSE level.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Overworking pastry dough -- gluten must be minimised in pastry (opposite of bread); chill between folds
2. Proving dough too long -- over-proved dough collapses because the gluten structure is overstretched
3. Not understanding the science -- every technique has a scientific explanation; teach the why alongside the how
