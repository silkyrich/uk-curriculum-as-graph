## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Specialist Making Processes and CAM (DT-KS3-C005)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

At KS3, making extends beyond hand tool skills to encompass specialist processes — including laser cutting, CNC routing, 3D printing, vacuum forming, heat bending, laminating and computer-aided manufacture (CAM) — that are used in professional design and manufacturing contexts. Understanding which processes are appropriate for specific materials and design outcomes, and developing competence in executing them precisely, is the central challenge of the make domain at KS3. Pupils also develop understanding that making is not a one-pass process but an iterative one: encountering problems during making often requires returning to the design to adapt it.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce CAM processes by connecting them to the design file: how does a 2D vector drawing become a laser-cut part? How does a 3D model become a 3D-printed component? Set making tasks that require pupils to select from a range of available processes, justifying their choice in terms of material, precision, speed and scale. Build in time for pupils to encounter and solve problems during making, developing their adaptive and iterative making skills. Teach quality control as an integral part of making: check, measure and test at each stage, not only at the end.

**Key vocabulary:** CAM, laser cutting, 3D printing, CNC, vacuum forming, laminating, process, precision, tolerance, iterate, adapt, quality, manufacture, prototype, subtractive

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may assume that CAM processes always produce better results than hand making, not understanding that the quality of the output depends on the quality of the design file. They may also see CAM as 'cheating' rather than as a professional making skill. Some pupils may not understand why making problems require design modifications rather than just making harder; the iterative relationship between designing and making needs explicit modelling.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can use basic hand tools safely with guidance and follows step-by-step making instructions, but does not independently select tools or processes for a given task. | You need to cut a piece of acrylic sheet along a straight line. Name the tool you would use and describe one safety precaution. | Suggesting a wood saw, which would crack the acrylic due to inappropriate tooth pattern; Not mentioning clamping or securing the workpiece before cutting |
| **Developing** | Can select appropriate tools and processes for different materials, understands the link between CAD files and CAM output, and works with reasonable precision. | Explain how a 2D drawing on a computer becomes a laser-cut part. What file format is needed and what must the designer check before cutting? | Using a raster image format (JPEG, PNG) instead of a vector format; Not checking that the design is at actual size (1:1 scale) before sending to the machine |
| **Secure** | Selects and uses specialist tools and CAM processes competently, adapts making approaches when problems arise, and applies quality control checks throughout the making process. | During making, you discover that two laser-cut pieces do not fit together properly — there is a 2mm gap. Describe how you would diagnose the problem and what you would do next. | Trying to fix the gap with adhesive rather than diagnosing and correcting the root cause; Not testing the correction on scrap material before committing to a full re-cut |
| **Mastery** | Combines hand and digital manufacturing processes strategically, understands industrial manufacturing contexts, and evaluates when CAM offers genuine advantages over hand making. | A small business makes 50 identical wooden phone stands per month. Compare making them entirely by hand versus using a CNC router, and recommend an approach. | Recommending only CNC or only hand making without considering a hybrid approach; Not considering the setup time and cost investment required for CNC production |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *I would use a coping saw or a strip heater to score and snap the acrylic. A safety precaution is to clamp the acrylic firmly to the bench before cutting so it does not move and cause the saw to slip.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *The designer creates a 2D vector drawing (using software like Adobe Illustrator or 2D Design) and saves it as an SVG or DXF file. Vector files use mathematical lines rather than pixels, which the laser cutter needs to follow a precise path. Before cutting, the designer must check: the line colours are correctly assigned (red for cut, blue for engrave, for example), the material thickness matches the laser power settings, and the drawing dimensions are correct at 1:1 scale. The file is sent to the laser cutter software, which converts the vector paths into motor commands that move the laser head across the material.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *First I would measure both pieces with a digital calliper to check whether the dimensions match my design file. If they do, the error is in my design — I would return to the CAD file, adjust the joint dimensions to close the 2mm gap, and re-cut the affected piece. If the pieces do not match the design file, the error is in the cutting process — I would check the laser cutter's calibration and material positioning. Either way, this is an iterative process: the making problem has revealed a design issue that needs to be resolved before continuing. I would keep the incorrect pieces as a record of what went wrong and make notes about the correction for my design log. Before cutting the replacement, I would cut a test joint in scrap material to verify the fix works.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Hand making: each stand requires marking out, sawing, drilling and sanding — perhaps 45 minutes per unit. At 50 per month, that is approximately 37.5 hours of skilled labour. Each piece will have slight variations, which could be marketed as 'handcrafted' but makes quality control harder. Errors waste material and time. CNC routing: requires upfront investment in a CNC router and time to create the CAD/CAM file and set cutting parameters. However, once set up, each stand takes perhaps 10 minutes of machine time with minimal operator involvement, and every piece is identical. The CNC can also cut complex curves and pockets that would be very time-consuming by hand. My recommendation: a hybrid approach. Use the CNC router for the primary shaping (cutting the profile, drilling holes, cutting the phone slot) to ensure precision and consistency, then hand-finish with sanding and oiling to add the tactile quality that distinguishes a premium product from a mass-produced one. This combines the precision and efficiency of CAM with the craft quality of hand finishing. At 50 units per month, the CNC setup cost is justified by the labour savings within a few months.*

### Secondary concept: User-Centred Design (DT-KS3-C001)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

User-centred design is a design philosophy and process that places the needs, capabilities, preferences and context of intended users at the centre of every design decision. It involves deep empathy with users, structured research methods (interviews, observation, surveys, prototyping), iterative testing with real users, and continuous refinement based on user feedback. At KS3, pupils develop understanding of user-centred design as a distinct and powerful approach that produces solutions better suited to genuine human needs than solutions derived purely from technical or aesthetic assumptions.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Recognises that designers should think about who will use a product, but relies on personal assumptions rather than structured research to identify user needs. | Listing features they personally want rather than questions about user needs; Focusing only on appearance rather than functional requirements |
| **Developing** | Can describe user-centred design methods such as interviews and observation, and begins to use them to create a basic design specification, though research may be shallow. | Writing leading questions that assume a solution (e.g., 'Would you like a bigger handle?'); Not explaining how the information gathered would inform specific design decisions |
| **Secure** | Conducts structured user research, develops user personas, translates findings into measurable design criteria, and uses iterative prototyping to test ideas with real users. | Skipping the observation and interview stages and jumping straight to designing based on assumptions; Creating a prototype but not testing it with actual users in the real context of use |
| **Mastery** | Critically evaluates competing user needs and design trade-offs, applies professional design thinking frameworks, and justifies design decisions with reference to user research evidence. | Simply choosing one user group over the other rather than seeking an inclusive solution; Not referencing real-world examples of inclusive design that resolve similar tensions |

### Secondary concept: Materials Science and Properties (DT-KS3-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Materials science is the study of the properties of materials - physical, mechanical, thermal, electrical, chemical and aesthetic - and how these properties determine the suitability of materials for specific applications. At KS3, pupils develop systematic understanding of the properties of a range of materials including metals, polymers, wood-based materials, ceramics, composites and smart materials. Understanding properties enables pupils to make informed material selection decisions and to understand why materials behave as they do under different conditions and manufacturing processes.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can name some materials (wood, metal, plastic) and describe basic properties such as hard, soft or flexible, but struggles to explain why a specific material is chosen for a specific purpose. | Saying 'because metal gets hot' without explaining the concept of thermal conductivity; Not recognising that the choice relates to material properties, not just tradition |
| **Developing** | Understands categories of materials and their general properties, and can select appropriate materials for simple products by matching properties to requirements. | Choosing a material based on personal preference rather than comparing properties against requirements; Not considering that different users might have different protection priorities |
| **Secure** | Systematically evaluates materials against multiple criteria including functional performance, aesthetics, cost, environmental impact and manufacturing compatibility, using a selection matrix approach. | Including only one or two criteria rather than considering multiple requirements simultaneously; Not acknowledging that different weightings of criteria could change the recommendation |
| **Mastery** | Applies advanced materials knowledge including smart materials and composites, evaluates how material properties interact with manufacturing processes, and considers the full lifecycle of material choices. | Focusing only on performance improvements without considering manufacturing constraints and environmental costs; Not recognising that the recyclability difference between metals and composites is a significant sustainability issue |

## Thinking lens: Perspective and Interpretation (primary)

**Key question:** Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?

**Why this lens fits:** User-centred design is built on the systematic practice of adopting the user's perspective — empathy mapping, user journey analysis and prototype testing with real users all require pupils to interpret the design problem through someone else's lived experience.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- What contextual factors shaped this perspective?
- How does the author's position affect the reliability of this account?
- Whose perspective is missing from this record, and why does that matter?
- How have interpretations of this event changed over time, and what drove those changes?

**Secondary lens:** Structure and Function — Selecting the right material for a complex product and the right specialist process to work it (laser cutting sheet acrylic, CNC routing MDF) requires reasoning about how the material's structure enables or constrains the chosen manufacturing process and the product's eventual function.

## Session structure: Design, Make, Evaluate

### Design, Make, Evaluate
The core Design & Technology cycle. Pupils investigate existing products and user needs, design a solution with clear specifications, plan the making process, construct using appropriate materials and techniques, test against the design brief, and evaluate the outcome with suggestions for improvement.

`investigate` → `design` → `plan` → `make` → `test` → `evaluate`

**Assessment:** Design portfolio including investigation findings, annotated design with specifications, making log, test results, and evaluative conclusion comparing outcome to original brief.

**Teacher note:** Use the DESIGN, MAKE AND EVALUATE template: investigate the context, users, and existing solutions before designing. Expect detailed design development with annotation explaining choices of material, construction, and finish. Guide making with attention to precision, quality of finish, and safe use of tools. Demand evaluation against the specification that identifies strengths, weaknesses, and potential improvements.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How have you used your investigation of existing products to inform your design?
- What are the strengths of your chosen materials and construction methods?
- How does the quality of your making compare with your design intentions?
- How would you improve your product based on testing and evaluation?

## Design and Technology: Cad Cam

**Design brief:** Design and make a decorative wall clock using CAD software and a laser cutter. The clock must include a working clock mechanism. The design must be original and demonstrate understanding of the capabilities and limitations of laser cutting.

**Materials:** plywood (3mm or 6mm), acrylic sheet (3mm), clock mechanism and hands, battery (AA), adhesive pads
**Tools:** 2D CAD software (2D Design, Inkscape, or similar), laser cutter (teacher operated), pillar drill (for mechanism hole if needed), sandpaper, paint or varnish
**Techniques:** 2D vector drawing in CAD software, distinguishing cut lines from engrave lines, test cutting on scrap material, assembling laser-cut components, fitting clock mechanism
**Safety notes:** Laser cutter: teacher-operated only. Pupils must not look at the laser beam. Ensure adequate extraction is running before cutting. Acrylic produces fumes when cut -- only use in well-ventilated conditions with extraction. Never cut PVC or polycarbonate (toxic fumes). Check all material datasheets before cutting.

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Does the clock mechanism work correctly?
- Is the CAD design precise and well-finished?
- Does the design demonstrate understanding of laser cutting capabilities?
- Is the clock aesthetically appealing?

---

## Why this study matters

A laser-cut clock is the ideal introduction to CAD/CAM because the product is flat (suitable for 2D cutting), requires precise geometry (the clock mechanism needs an exact hole), and has both functional and aesthetic dimensions. Pupils learn to use 2D design software, convert designs to machine-readable files, and operate a laser cutter. The project demonstrates that digital manufacturing produces results impossible by hand (intricate patterns, precise tolerances).

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Design too detailed for the material thickness -- test cuts on scrap material first
2. Clock mechanism hole not the right size -- measure the mechanism shaft diameter exactly
3. Not accounting for kerf (material removed by the laser) -- teach that cuts are slightly wider than the line
