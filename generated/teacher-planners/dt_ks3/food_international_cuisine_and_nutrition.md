## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Nutrition Science and Dietary Planning (DT-KS3-C007)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Nutrition science is the study of how the nutrients contained in food — macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, fats) and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals) — are used by the body to maintain health, support growth and provide energy. At KS3, pupils develop beyond basic food group awareness to understand the specific roles of macronutrients and key micronutrients, the consequences of nutritional deficiency or excess, and how to plan a diet that meets individual nutritional needs. This knowledge underpins the ability to make informed food choices and to prepare nutritionally appropriate meals.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach macronutrients and key micronutrients through their specific functions in the body: carbohydrates for energy, proteins for growth and repair, fats for energy storage and cell structure, iron for oxygen transport, calcium for bone density. Use nutritional analysis tools and food labels to develop pupils' ability to evaluate the nutritional content of ingredients and dishes. Set dietary planning tasks that require pupils to design a day's meals meeting specified nutritional targets. Connect to cooking through the selection of ingredients that together provide a balanced nutrient profile.

**Key vocabulary:** macronutrient, micronutrient, carbohydrate, protein, fat, vitamin, mineral, fibre, calorie, energy, deficiency, diet, nutrition, balance, guideline daily amount

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may have oversimplified views of nutritional 'good' and 'bad' foods, not understanding that most foods provide a range of nutrients and that nutritional quality depends on overall diet pattern rather than individual foods. The roles of fat and carbohydrate are often misunderstood due to popular diet culture; teaching evidence-based nutritional science corrects common misconceptions about these macronutrients.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows that food contains nutrients needed for health and can name some basic food groups, but cannot explain the specific roles of macronutrients or micronutrients in the body. | Name the three macronutrients and give one food source for each. | Confusing macronutrients with food groups (e.g., saying 'fruit and vegetables' is a macronutrient); Not being able to name all three macronutrients |
| **Developing** | Can explain the main functions of macronutrients and some key micronutrients, and understands that a balanced diet provides all nutrients in appropriate quantities. | Explain why an athlete needs more protein than a sedentary office worker, and name two good sources of protein. | Saying athletes need protein 'for energy' — protein is primarily for growth and repair, not the main energy source; Not distinguishing between animal and plant protein sources |
| **Secure** | Plans nutritionally balanced meals using knowledge of macronutrient and micronutrient functions, analyses nutritional content using food labels and data, and understands the consequences of deficiency or excess. | Plan a day's meals for a 14-year-old vegetarian that meets their protein, iron and calcium needs. Explain how each meal contributes. | Not addressing the reduced iron absorption from plant sources or the need for vitamin C pairing; Relying on a single protein source rather than combining complementary plant proteins |
| **Mastery** | Critically evaluates nutritional advice and dietary trends using evidence-based nutritional science, and applies nutrition knowledge to design diets for specific health conditions or life stages. | A popular diet eliminates all carbohydrates. Using your knowledge of nutrition science, evaluate this approach and explain what would happen to the body. | Accepting or rejecting the diet without explaining the underlying nutritional science; Not distinguishing between refined and complex carbohydrates in the evaluation |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Carbohydrates — found in bread and pasta. Protein — found in chicken and eggs. Fat — found in butter and olive oil.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Protein is needed for the growth and repair of body tissues, including muscle. An athlete trains intensively, which causes microscopic damage to muscle fibres. During recovery, the body repairs and rebuilds these fibres using amino acids from dietary protein, making the muscles stronger. An office worker has much less muscle damage to repair, so needs less protein. Good sources include chicken breast (about 31g protein per 100g) and lentils (about 9g per 100g, a plant-based option).*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Breakfast: Porridge made with fortified soya milk (calcium + protein), topped with pumpkin seeds (iron + protein) and banana (potassium, energy). Lunch: Wholemeal pitta with hummus (protein from chickpeas, iron), mixed salad with spinach (iron, vitamin C for iron absorption), and a portion of cheese (calcium, protein). Dinner: Lentil and vegetable curry (protein, iron, fibre) with brown rice (complex carbohydrates, B vitamins), served with a glass of orange juice (vitamin C to enhance non-haem iron absorption from lentils). Snack: Yoghurt with almonds (calcium, protein). Key considerations: vegetarian iron sources (non-haem iron) are less readily absorbed than meat sources, so I paired iron-rich foods with vitamin C to improve absorption. Calcium comes from dairy, fortified soya milk and almonds. Protein is spread across all meals from diverse plant and dairy sources to ensure all essential amino acids are provided.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Carbohydrates are the body's primary and most efficient energy source. Glucose from carbohydrates fuels the brain (which uses about 120g of glucose per day) and provides readily available energy for physical activity. Eliminating all carbohydrates forces the body into ketosis: when glucose is unavailable, the liver converts stored fat into ketone bodies, which the brain and muscles can use as an alternative fuel. Short-term effects include rapid weight loss (mostly water, as glycogen stores are depleted along with their associated water), fatigue, headaches and difficulty concentrating. Long-term risks include: nutrient deficiencies (fibre from wholegrains, B vitamins, antioxidants from fruits are all carbohydrate-associated nutrients); kidney strain from processing excess protein; potential cardiovascular risk from high saturated fat intake if replacing carbohydrates with fatty meats; and loss of the gut microbiome diversity supported by dietary fibre. The diet confuses simple refined carbohydrates (white sugar, white flour — associated with poor health outcomes) with complex carbohydrates (wholegrains, vegetables, legumes — associated with positive health outcomes). Evidence-based nutritional science recommends replacing refined carbohydrates with complex ones, not eliminating the entire macronutrient category.*

### Secondary concept: Advanced Cooking Techniques and Culinary Skills (DT-KS3-C008)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Advanced cooking techniques at KS3 extend pupils' practical competence to include a broader repertoire of preparation and cooking methods across different food categories and cuisines. These include more complex knife skills (julienne, chiffonade, dicing), a range of heat application methods (sautéing, braising, roasting, poaching, steaming), and techniques for improving flavour, texture and presentation (seasoning, reduction, garnishing, emulsification). Developing a repertoire of competent cooking techniques enables pupils to prepare a wide variety of dishes that support a healthy, varied diet.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can follow a recipe to prepare a simple dish with support, but does not understand why specific techniques are used or how to adapt if something goes wrong. | Thinking it is just about appearance rather than even cooking; Not understanding that stir-frying uses high heat for a short time, so uniform size is critical |
| **Developing** | Can execute a range of cooking techniques (boiling, frying, baking, grilling) with reasonable competence and understands the basic science behind them (e.g., heat causes proteins to denature). | Confusing sauteing with shallow frying (shallow frying uses more oil and food is not moved constantly); Not explaining the scientific reason why deep-fried food has a crispy exterior (moisture evaporation and surface sealing) |
| **Secure** | Coordinates multiple cooking techniques within a single multi-component dish, uses sensory evaluation to adjust seasoning and timing, and understands the food science behind technique choices. | Not chilling the pastry before rolling, leading to shrinkage and tough texture; Putting hot filling into the pastry case, which melts the fat and produces a soggy bottom |
| **Mastery** | Adapts techniques creatively, understands the science well enough to diagnose and fix problems, and can develop recipes independently based on knowledge of how ingredients behave. | Not understanding that hollandaise is an emulsion (a mixture of two liquids that do not normally mix); Attempting to rescue by adding more butter, which makes the problem worse by adding more fat without more emulsifier |

## Thinking lens: Systems and System Models (primary)

**Key question:** What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?

**Why this lens fits:** Nutrition science at KS3 requires pupils to model the human body as a system with specific nutrient requirements — understanding how deficiencies or excesses in one nutrient affect the whole system underpins the analytical demands of this cluster.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- What feedback loops exist in this system?
- Does this model capture all the important interactions, or does it oversimplify?
- What emergent property arises from these components interacting?
- How would removing or adding a component change the system's behaviour?

**Secondary lens:** Cause and Effect — Advanced cooking techniques are applied because specific heat and chemical processes cause desired transformations in food — emulsification, Maillard reactions, gelatinisation — and pupils must understand the causal mechanism to select and execute techniques effectively.

## Session structure: Design, Make, Evaluate

### Design, Make, Evaluate
The core Design & Technology cycle. Pupils investigate existing products and user needs, design a solution with clear specifications, plan the making process, construct using appropriate materials and techniques, test against the design brief, and evaluate the outcome with suggestions for improvement.

`investigate` → `design` → `plan` → `make` → `test` → `evaluate`

**Assessment:** Design portfolio including investigation findings, annotated design with specifications, making log, test results, and evaluative conclusion comparing outcome to original brief.

**Teacher note:** Use the DESIGN, MAKE AND EVALUATE template: investigate the context, users, and existing solutions before designing. Expect detailed design development with annotation explaining choices of material, construction, and finish. Guide making with attention to precision, quality of finish, and safe use of tools. Demand evaluation against the specification that identifies strengths, weaknesses, and potential improvements.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How have you used your investigation of existing products to inform your design?
- What are the strengths of your chosen materials and construction methods?
- How does the quality of your making compare with your design intentions?
- How would you improve your product based on testing and evaluation?

## Design and Technology: Cooking And Nutrition

**Design brief:** Research, plan, prepare and cook a two-course meal from an international cuisine of your choice. Analyse the nutritional content of your meal and evaluate how it meets the Eatwell Guide principles. Adapt the recipe to meet a specific dietary requirement.

**Materials:** varied ingredients appropriate to chosen cuisine, staple ingredients (rice, pasta, flour, oil, spices), fresh vegetables and protein sources
**Tools:** chef's knife, chopping boards (colour-coded for hygiene), saucepans and frying pans, hob and oven (teacher supervised), measuring scales and jugs, food processor (teacher supervised)
**Techniques:** knife skills (bridge, claw, rocking motion), stir-frying, simmering and reducing, seasoning and tasting, nutritional analysis using food tables or software, food safety and hygiene protocols
**Safety notes:** Knife skills: demonstrate correct grip and technique before each session. Colour-coded chopping boards mandatory (red=raw meat, green=salad, blue=raw fish, white=dairy, yellow=cooked meat). Hob and oven: teacher supervision required. Hot oil: demonstrate safe pan handling. Check all allergens before each session. Handwashing: beginning, between tasks, end.

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Is the meal well-cooked and well-seasoned?
- Does the nutritional analysis demonstrate understanding?
- Has the recipe been successfully adapted for a dietary requirement?
- Can you describe the cultural context of the dishes?
**Food allergens:** varies by cuisine chosen -- full allergen check required before each session
**Food skills:** knife skills, stir-frying, simmering, seasoning, nutritional analysis, recipe adaptation

## Why this study matters

Exploring international cuisines (e.g. Indian dhal, Chinese stir-fry, Mexican tortillas, Italian risotto) teaches nutrition science through cultural context. Each cuisine offers different balances of macronutrients and introduces different cooking techniques (tempering spices, stir-frying at high heat, slow cooking). Pupils learn that healthy eating is culturally diverse, not a single prescription. Nutritional analysis of each dish connects cooking to science.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Reducing international food to stereotypes -- research authentic regional variations rather than 'British curry'
2. Not teaching knife skills progressively -- start with bridge grip and claw grip before attempting fine dice
3. Ignoring dietary requirements -- plan recipes with vegetarian, halal, and allergen-free alternatives
