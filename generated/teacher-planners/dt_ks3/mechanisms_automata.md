## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Specialist Making Processes and CAM (DT-KS3-C005)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

At KS3, making extends beyond hand tool skills to encompass specialist processes — including laser cutting, CNC routing, 3D printing, vacuum forming, heat bending, laminating and computer-aided manufacture (CAM) — that are used in professional design and manufacturing contexts. Understanding which processes are appropriate for specific materials and design outcomes, and developing competence in executing them precisely, is the central challenge of the make domain at KS3. Pupils also develop understanding that making is not a one-pass process but an iterative one: encountering problems during making often requires returning to the design to adapt it.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce CAM processes by connecting them to the design file: how does a 2D vector drawing become a laser-cut part? How does a 3D model become a 3D-printed component? Set making tasks that require pupils to select from a range of available processes, justifying their choice in terms of material, precision, speed and scale. Build in time for pupils to encounter and solve problems during making, developing their adaptive and iterative making skills. Teach quality control as an integral part of making: check, measure and test at each stage, not only at the end.

**Key vocabulary:** CAM, laser cutting, 3D printing, CNC, vacuum forming, laminating, process, precision, tolerance, iterate, adapt, quality, manufacture, prototype, subtractive

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may assume that CAM processes always produce better results than hand making, not understanding that the quality of the output depends on the quality of the design file. They may also see CAM as 'cheating' rather than as a professional making skill. Some pupils may not understand why making problems require design modifications rather than just making harder; the iterative relationship between designing and making needs explicit modelling.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can use basic hand tools safely with guidance and follows step-by-step making instructions, but does not independently select tools or processes for a given task. | You need to cut a piece of acrylic sheet along a straight line. Name the tool you would use and describe one safety precaution. | Suggesting a wood saw, which would crack the acrylic due to inappropriate tooth pattern; Not mentioning clamping or securing the workpiece before cutting |
| **Developing** | Can select appropriate tools and processes for different materials, understands the link between CAD files and CAM output, and works with reasonable precision. | Explain how a 2D drawing on a computer becomes a laser-cut part. What file format is needed and what must the designer check before cutting? | Using a raster image format (JPEG, PNG) instead of a vector format; Not checking that the design is at actual size (1:1 scale) before sending to the machine |
| **Secure** | Selects and uses specialist tools and CAM processes competently, adapts making approaches when problems arise, and applies quality control checks throughout the making process. | During making, you discover that two laser-cut pieces do not fit together properly — there is a 2mm gap. Describe how you would diagnose the problem and what you would do next. | Trying to fix the gap with adhesive rather than diagnosing and correcting the root cause; Not testing the correction on scrap material before committing to a full re-cut |
| **Mastery** | Combines hand and digital manufacturing processes strategically, understands industrial manufacturing contexts, and evaluates when CAM offers genuine advantages over hand making. | A small business makes 50 identical wooden phone stands per month. Compare making them entirely by hand versus using a CNC router, and recommend an approach. | Recommending only CNC or only hand making without considering a hybrid approach; Not considering the setup time and cost investment required for CNC production |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *I would use a coping saw or a strip heater to score and snap the acrylic. A safety precaution is to clamp the acrylic firmly to the bench before cutting so it does not move and cause the saw to slip.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *The designer creates a 2D vector drawing (using software like Adobe Illustrator or 2D Design) and saves it as an SVG or DXF file. Vector files use mathematical lines rather than pixels, which the laser cutter needs to follow a precise path. Before cutting, the designer must check: the line colours are correctly assigned (red for cut, blue for engrave, for example), the material thickness matches the laser power settings, and the drawing dimensions are correct at 1:1 scale. The file is sent to the laser cutter software, which converts the vector paths into motor commands that move the laser head across the material.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *First I would measure both pieces with a digital calliper to check whether the dimensions match my design file. If they do, the error is in my design — I would return to the CAD file, adjust the joint dimensions to close the 2mm gap, and re-cut the affected piece. If the pieces do not match the design file, the error is in the cutting process — I would check the laser cutter's calibration and material positioning. Either way, this is an iterative process: the making problem has revealed a design issue that needs to be resolved before continuing. I would keep the incorrect pieces as a record of what went wrong and make notes about the correction for my design log. Before cutting the replacement, I would cut a test joint in scrap material to verify the fix works.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Hand making: each stand requires marking out, sawing, drilling and sanding — perhaps 45 minutes per unit. At 50 per month, that is approximately 37.5 hours of skilled labour. Each piece will have slight variations, which could be marketed as 'handcrafted' but makes quality control harder. Errors waste material and time. CNC routing: requires upfront investment in a CNC router and time to create the CAD/CAM file and set cutting parameters. However, once set up, each stand takes perhaps 10 minutes of machine time with minimal operator involvement, and every piece is identical. The CNC can also cut complex curves and pockets that would be very time-consuming by hand. My recommendation: a hybrid approach. Use the CNC router for the primary shaping (cutting the profile, drilling holes, cutting the phone slot) to ensure precision and consistency, then hand-finish with sanding and oiling to add the tactile quality that distinguishes a premium product from a mass-produced one. This combines the precision and efficiency of CAM with the craft quality of hand finishing. At 50 units per month, the CNC setup cost is justified by the labour savings within a few months.*

### Secondary concept: Materials Science and Properties (DT-KS3-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Materials science is the study of the properties of materials - physical, mechanical, thermal, electrical, chemical and aesthetic - and how these properties determine the suitability of materials for specific applications. At KS3, pupils develop systematic understanding of the properties of a range of materials including metals, polymers, wood-based materials, ceramics, composites and smart materials. Understanding properties enables pupils to make informed material selection decisions and to understand why materials behave as they do under different conditions and manufacturing processes.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can name some materials (wood, metal, plastic) and describe basic properties such as hard, soft or flexible, but struggles to explain why a specific material is chosen for a specific purpose. | Saying 'because metal gets hot' without explaining the concept of thermal conductivity; Not recognising that the choice relates to material properties, not just tradition |
| **Developing** | Understands categories of materials and their general properties, and can select appropriate materials for simple products by matching properties to requirements. | Choosing a material based on personal preference rather than comparing properties against requirements; Not considering that different users might have different protection priorities |
| **Secure** | Systematically evaluates materials against multiple criteria including functional performance, aesthetics, cost, environmental impact and manufacturing compatibility, using a selection matrix approach. | Including only one or two criteria rather than considering multiple requirements simultaneously; Not acknowledging that different weightings of criteria could change the recommendation |
| **Mastery** | Applies advanced materials knowledge including smart materials and composites, evaluates how material properties interact with manufacturing processes, and considers the full lifecycle of material choices. | Focusing only on performance improvements without considering manufacturing constraints and environmental costs; Not recognising that the recyclability difference between metals and composites is a significant sustainability issue |

### Secondary concept: Material Selection for Complex Products (DT-KS3-C006)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Selecting materials for complex products at KS3 requires systematic evaluation of a wider range of materials — including metals, polymers, wood-based materials, composites, textiles, smart materials and electronic components — against multiple criteria simultaneously: functional performance, aesthetic requirements, cost, availability, environmental impact, and compatibility with available making processes. The increased complexity of KS3 products means that multiple materials are often combined, requiring understanding of how materials interact with each other and with making processes.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Tends to choose familiar materials (usually wood or card) for all projects without considering whether the material's properties match the product's requirements. | Saying wood is fine if you 'paint it' without recognising that paint chips and the wood underneath still absorbs moisture; Not explaining why the alternative material is specifically better for this application |
| **Developing** | Can compare materials across multiple properties and select materials that meet basic functional and aesthetic requirements for a given product. | Choosing based on cost alone without considering whether the material meets all functional requirements; Not specifying the actual temperature resistance of the materials |
| **Secure** | Uses systematic multi-criteria evaluation to select materials, considers how materials interact with manufacturing processes, and evaluates material combinations in multi-material products. | Choosing materials without explaining the specific properties that make them suitable; Not considering how different materials will be joined together in the final product |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates advanced materials including composites and smart materials, assesses lifecycle environmental impact of material choices, and makes design decisions that balance competing requirements across performance, cost and sustainability. | Assuming that the lightest and strongest material is always the best choice regardless of context; Not considering the end-of-life recyclability difference between thermoplastic and thermoset materials |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Selecting the right material for a complex product and the right specialist process to work it (laser cutting sheet acrylic, CNC routing MDF) requires reasoning about how the material's structure enables or constrains the chosen manufacturing process and the product's eventual function.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- How does the structure at this scale enable the function we observe?
- What trade-offs were involved in this structural design?
- How is this structure adapted to solve a specific problem?
- What would you predict about an organism's function from its structure alone?

**Secondary lens:** Systems and System Models — Embedded computing products are input-process-output systems: sensors gather environmental data, the microcontroller processes it according to a program, and actuators produce a physical response — designing such a product requires the pupil to model and balance all three system components.

## Session structure: Design, Make, Evaluate

### Design, Make, Evaluate
The core Design & Technology cycle. Pupils investigate existing products and user needs, design a solution with clear specifications, plan the making process, construct using appropriate materials and techniques, test against the design brief, and evaluate the outcome with suggestions for improvement.

`investigate` → `design` → `plan` → `make` → `test` → `evaluate`

**Assessment:** Design portfolio including investigation findings, annotated design with specifications, making log, test results, and evaluative conclusion comparing outcome to original brief.

**Teacher note:** Use the DESIGN, MAKE AND EVALUATE template: investigate the context, users, and existing solutions before designing. Expect detailed design development with annotation explaining choices of material, construction, and finish. Guide making with attention to precision, quality of finish, and safe use of tools. Demand evaluation against the specification that identifies strengths, weaknesses, and potential improvements.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How have you used your investigation of existing products to inform your design?
- What are the strengths of your chosen materials and construction methods?
- How does the quality of your making compare with your design intentions?
- How would you improve your product based on testing and evaluation?

## Design and Technology: Mechanisms

**Design brief:** Design and build a mechanical automaton that tells a short story or depicts a scene through movement. The automaton must use at least two different types of mechanism (e.g. cam + linkage, crank + gear). Turning a single handle must produce multiple coordinated movements.

**Materials:** MDF or plywood for frame, wooden dowels for axles, card for cams and prototype mechanisms, gears (commercial or 3D-printed), wire for linkages, wooden blocks and spacers
**Tools:** tenon saw, pillar drill (teacher supervised), glue gun (teacher supervised), pliers and wire cutters, files, sandpaper
**Techniques:** cam profiling, crank construction, linkage design and assembly, frame construction with precise axle alignment, gear meshing and speed calculation
**Safety notes:** Pillar drill: teacher-supervised, hair tied back, safety glasses mandatory. Glue gun: teacher-supervised. Wire cutting: use pliers, not scissors. All rotating parts must be secure before testing. Ensure fingers cannot reach between gear teeth or mechanism moving parts.

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Does turning the handle produce multiple coordinated movements?
- Are at least two different mechanisms used?
- Is the movement smooth and reliable?
- Does the automaton tell a story or depict a scene effectively?

## Why this study matters

Automata (mechanical toys driven by cams, cranks, gears and linkages) build directly on KS2 cam mechanisms but with far greater mechanical complexity. Pupils combine multiple mechanisms in a single product: a crank converts rotation to reciprocation, a linkage amplifies or redirects motion, gears change speed and direction. The visible mechanism is part of the aesthetic -- automata celebrate engineering as art. This project integrates structures, mechanisms and resistant materials in a single outcome.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Mechanisms binding under load -- ensure all moving parts have adequate clearance and are properly aligned
2. Crank too short to produce visible movement -- longer cranks produce larger motion; demonstrate with prototypes
3. All pupils making the same automaton -- set a narrative theme and let each pupil tell a different story through motion
