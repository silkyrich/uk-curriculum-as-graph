## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Ethical and Sustainable Design (DT-KS3-C004)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Ethical design considers the consequences of design decisions for users, workers in the supply chain, communities and the broader environment. Sustainable design aims to meet current needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, considering the environmental impact of materials extraction, manufacturing, product use and end-of-life disposal. At KS3, pupils develop the analytical frameworks to evaluate products and their own designs from ethical and environmental perspectives, understanding that designers have responsibilities that extend beyond functional requirements.

**Teaching guidance:** Use life cycle analysis (LCA) to trace the environmental impact of a product from raw material extraction to end-of-life disposal. Discuss fair trade and ethical sourcing in the context of materials and food ingredients. Investigate the circular economy and how products can be designed for repair, reuse and recycling rather than disposal. Explore real examples of ethical and unethical design decisions: tobacco packaging, single-use plastics, accessibility failures. Connect to pupils' own design work by requiring ethical and environmental consideration as part of the evaluation process.

**Key vocabulary:** sustainable, ethical, life cycle, carbon footprint, fair trade, circular economy, biodegradable, recycling, supply chain, environmental impact, social responsibility, consequence, equity

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may think sustainability means using recycled materials, missing the much broader concept of reducing impact across the entire life cycle. Pupils may not see a connection between their individual design decisions and wider environmental or social outcomes; tracing specific design choices to their broader consequences makes this concrete. The apparent conflict between sustainability and cost or performance requires honest discussion of real-world trade-offs.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Aware that some products are harmful to the environment, such as plastic pollution, but cannot explain the broader concept of sustainability or the designer's role in reducing impact. | Why might a designer choose to make a product from recycled plastic instead of new plastic? | Saying recycled plastic is 'better for the environment' without explaining why; Thinking recycled plastic is free or has no environmental cost at all |
| **Developing** | Understands that sustainability involves considering environmental impact across a product's lifecycle, and can identify ethical issues in design such as fair trade and planned obsolescence. | Explain what 'planned obsolescence' means and why it is considered an ethical problem in design. | Confusing planned obsolescence with products that naturally wear out over time; Not identifying both the consumer harm and the environmental harm |
| **Secure** | Applies life cycle analysis to evaluate the environmental impact of products from material extraction through to disposal, and proposes design strategies to reduce impact at each stage. | Carry out a simplified life cycle analysis of a disposable paper coffee cup. Identify the environmental impact at each stage and suggest one improvement. | Analysing only one or two lifecycle stages rather than the full journey from raw material to disposal; Suggesting improvements without considering whether the infrastructure exists to support them |
| **Mastery** | Critically evaluates the circular economy model, analyses conflicting sustainability claims, and proposes design solutions that balance environmental, economic and social considerations. | A fashion company claims its clothing line is 'sustainable' because it uses organic cotton. Critically evaluate this claim using your knowledge of ethical and sustainable design. | Accepting the sustainability claim at face value without examining the full supply chain; Not recognising that sustainability requires consideration of social (labour) as well as environmental factors |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Recycled plastic uses material that already exists instead of making new plastic from oil. This means less oil needs to be extracted from the ground, and less plastic waste ends up in landfill or the ocean.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Planned obsolescence is when a designer deliberately makes a product that will break, wear out or become outdated after a set period, forcing the consumer to buy a replacement. For example, some phone manufacturers make batteries that cannot be replaced, so when the battery degrades after two years, the whole phone must be replaced. This is ethically problematic because it wastes resources, creates electronic waste, and exploits consumers who have no choice but to buy again. It prioritises the company's profit over the customer's interests and the environment.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Raw materials: Trees are felled for paper pulp (deforestation, habitat loss, CO2 release). The plastic lining is made from polyethylene derived from oil. Manufacturing: The pulp is processed using large quantities of water and energy; bleaching chemicals may contaminate waterways. The cup is assembled and printed. Distribution: Cups are transported from factory to coffee shops, creating transport emissions. Use: The cup is used once for approximately 15 minutes. End of life: The plastic lining makes the cup non-recyclable in standard paper recycling — it goes to landfill where it takes decades to decompose. Improvement: Replace the polyethylene lining with a plant-based PLA lining that is industrially compostable, so the cup can be composted rather than landfilled. However, this only works if composting infrastructure exists — otherwise the improvement is theoretical not practical.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Organic cotton addresses only one stage of the lifecycle — raw material production — by eliminating synthetic pesticides and fertilisers. However, organic cotton still requires enormous quantities of water (approximately 10,000 litres per kilogram), often grown in water-stressed regions. The claim ignores: dyeing and finishing processes, which may use toxic chemicals and consume vast amounts of water; manufacturing conditions, where garment workers may face exploitative wages and unsafe conditions; transport emissions from global supply chains; consumer use phase, where frequent washing releases microfibres; and end-of-life, where fast fashion garments are typically worn only a few times before disposal. A genuinely sustainable approach would need to address the full lifecycle: use lower-impact fibres (recycled polyester, linen, hemp); ensure fair labour conditions throughout the supply chain; design for durability and repairability rather than trend-driven obsolescence; and implement a take-back scheme for end-of-life garments. The 'organic cotton' label functions partly as greenwashing — it provides a visible sustainability signal while potentially obscuring harmful practices elsewhere in the supply chain. A circular economy approach would design clothing to be worn longer, repaired easily, and ultimately recycled into new fibre rather than discarded.*

### Secondary concept: User-Centred Design (DT-KS3-C001)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

User-centred design is a design philosophy and process that places the needs, capabilities, preferences and context of intended users at the centre of every design decision. It involves deep empathy with users, structured research methods (interviews, observation, surveys, prototyping), iterative testing with real users, and continuous refinement based on user feedback. At KS3, pupils develop understanding of user-centred design as a distinct and powerful approach that produces solutions better suited to genuine human needs than solutions derived purely from technical or aesthetic assumptions.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Recognises that designers should think about who will use a product, but relies on personal assumptions rather than structured research to identify user needs. | Listing features they personally want rather than questions about user needs; Focusing only on appearance rather than functional requirements |
| **Developing** | Can describe user-centred design methods such as interviews and observation, and begins to use them to create a basic design specification, though research may be shallow. | Writing leading questions that assume a solution (e.g., 'Would you like a bigger handle?'); Not explaining how the information gathered would inform specific design decisions |
| **Secure** | Conducts structured user research, develops user personas, translates findings into measurable design criteria, and uses iterative prototyping to test ideas with real users. | Skipping the observation and interview stages and jumping straight to designing based on assumptions; Creating a prototype but not testing it with actual users in the real context of use |
| **Mastery** | Critically evaluates competing user needs and design trade-offs, applies professional design thinking frameworks, and justifies design decisions with reference to user research evidence. | Simply choosing one user group over the other rather than seeking an inclusive solution; Not referencing real-world examples of inclusive design that resolve similar tensions |

### Secondary concept: Material Selection for Complex Products (DT-KS3-C006)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Selecting materials for complex products at KS3 requires systematic evaluation of a wider range of materials — including metals, polymers, wood-based materials, composites, textiles, smart materials and electronic components — against multiple criteria simultaneously: functional performance, aesthetic requirements, cost, availability, environmental impact, and compatibility with available making processes. The increased complexity of KS3 products means that multiple materials are often combined, requiring understanding of how materials interact with each other and with making processes.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Tends to choose familiar materials (usually wood or card) for all projects without considering whether the material's properties match the product's requirements. | Saying wood is fine if you 'paint it' without recognising that paint chips and the wood underneath still absorbs moisture; Not explaining why the alternative material is specifically better for this application |
| **Developing** | Can compare materials across multiple properties and select materials that meet basic functional and aesthetic requirements for a given product. | Choosing based on cost alone without considering whether the material meets all functional requirements; Not specifying the actual temperature resistance of the materials |
| **Secure** | Uses systematic multi-criteria evaluation to select materials, considers how materials interact with manufacturing processes, and evaluates material combinations in multi-material products. | Choosing materials without explaining the specific properties that make them suitable; Not considering how different materials will be joined together in the final product |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates advanced materials including composites and smart materials, assesses lifecycle environmental impact of material choices, and makes design decisions that balance competing requirements across performance, cost and sustainability. | Assuming that the lightest and strongest material is always the best choice regardless of context; Not considering the end-of-life recyclability difference between thermoplastic and thermoset materials |

## Thinking lens: Perspective and Interpretation (primary)

**Key question:** Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?

**Why this lens fits:** User-centred design is built on the systematic practice of adopting the user's perspective — empathy mapping, user journey analysis and prototype testing with real users all require pupils to interpret the design problem through someone else's lived experience.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- What contextual factors shaped this perspective?
- How does the author's position affect the reliability of this account?
- Whose perspective is missing from this record, and why does that matter?
- How have interpretations of this event changed over time, and what drove those changes?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — The iterative design cycle at KS3 generates evidence (user testing, prototype feedback) that must be used to argue for specific design improvements — each design iteration is a cycle of claim, evidence and revision.

## Session structure: Design, Make, Evaluate

### Design, Make, Evaluate
The core Design & Technology cycle. Pupils investigate existing products and user needs, design a solution with clear specifications, plan the making process, construct using appropriate materials and techniques, test against the design brief, and evaluate the outcome with suggestions for improvement.

`investigate` → `design` → `plan` → `make` → `test` → `evaluate`

**Assessment:** Design portfolio including investigation findings, annotated design with specifications, making log, test results, and evaluative conclusion comparing outcome to original brief.

**Teacher note:** Use the DESIGN, MAKE AND EVALUATE template: investigate the context, users, and existing solutions before designing. Expect detailed design development with annotation explaining choices of material, construction, and finish. Guide making with attention to precision, quality of finish, and safe use of tools. Demand evaluation against the specification that identifies strengths, weaknesses, and potential improvements.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How have you used your investigation of existing products to inform your design?
- What are the strengths of your chosen materials and construction methods?
- How does the quality of your making compare with your design intentions?
- How would you improve your product based on testing and evaluation?

## Design and Technology: Sustainable Design

**Design brief:** Identify a waste material stream (e.g. plastic bottles, cardboard, textile offcuts, electronic waste). Design and make a functional product from these waste materials. Document the lifecycle of your materials and evaluate the sustainability of your product compared to a newly manufactured alternative.

**Materials:** collected waste materials (plastic, card, textiles, etc.), basic fixings (screws, bolts, adhesives), finishing materials as appropriate
**Tools:** dependent on chosen material -- hand tools as appropriate, sewing machine (for textiles), heat gun (teacher supervised, for plastic forming), basic hand tools
**Techniques:** material analysis and selection, lifecycle assessment, joining dissimilar materials, finishing repurposed materials, user testing and feedback
**Safety notes:** Waste materials may have sharp edges or unknown chemical properties. Wear gloves when handling waste materials until they have been cleaned and assessed. Heat gun: teacher-supervised only, use in well-ventilated area. Electronic waste: never disassemble devices with capacitors (CRT monitors, microwave ovens).

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Does the product serve a genuine functional purpose?
- Is the lifecycle analysis thorough and accurate?
- Does the product demonstrate creative use of waste materials?
- How does the sustainability compare to a new product?

---

## Why this study matters

An upcycling design challenge forces pupils to work within material constraints -- the available waste materials define the design possibilities. This teaches sustainable design thinking: considering the environmental impact of material choices, the lifecycle of products, and the concept of circular design. Pupils investigate real-world sustainability issues (plastic waste, fast fashion, planned obsolescence) and respond with a designed product that gives waste materials a new, functional life.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Product is decorative but not functional -- the upcycled product must serve a genuine purpose
2. Not documenting the source materials -- trace the origin and original purpose of each material used
3. Surface-level engagement with sustainability -- push beyond 'recycling is good' to lifecycle analysis
