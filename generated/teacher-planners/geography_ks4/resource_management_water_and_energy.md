## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Water Insecurity and Management (GE-KS4-C007)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The global patterns of water supply and demand, the causes and consequences of water insecurity (including both water scarcity and water stress), and the range of strategies for improving water security sustainably in both high-income and low-income contexts.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach the distinction between physical water scarcity (insufficient rainfall or groundwater to meet demand) and economic water scarcity (water exists but infrastructure or governance prevents access). The geography of water insecurity is complex: some regions have abundant precipitation but poor infrastructure, while others have high rainfall seasonally but face dry-season deficits. Management strategies should be evaluated as a spectrum from high-tech and capital-intensive (large dams, desalination, inter-basin water transfer) to small-scale and intermediate (rainwater harvesting, irrigation efficiency, borehole construction). GCSE evaluation questions ask students to compare the advantages and disadvantages of different strategies, considering their costs, environmental impacts, social effects, and sustainability. Named examples required: a specific water transfer scheme, a named water conservation project.

**Key vocabulary:** water security, water insecurity, water scarcity, water stress, physical water scarcity, economic water scarcity, groundwater, aquifer, desalination, water transfer, dam, reservoir, irrigation, water harvesting, grey water, water footprint, virtual water

**Common misconceptions:** Students frequently equate water shortage with low rainfall, overlooking economic water scarcity (the problem of access and infrastructure rather than total availability). Students often evaluate large-scale infrastructure solutions (dams, desalination) as superior to small-scale solutions without considering their cost, displacement of communities, and environmental impacts. Students sometimes present water insecurity as affecting only LICs, ignoring water stress in parts of the USA, Australia, and Mediterranean Europe.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify that water is essential for life and that some places have more water than others, but cannot explain the causes of water insecurity or distinguish between physical and economic water scarcity. | Why do some countries not have enough water? | Attributing water scarcity only to physical factors (low rainfall) without considering infrastructure and governance; Not recognising that water insecurity exists in some high-rainfall countries |
| **Developing** | Can explain the difference between physical and economic water scarcity, describe global patterns of water stress, and explain why demand is increasing. | Explain the difference between physical and economic water scarcity. Give an example of each. (4 marks) | Treating all water scarcity as caused by low rainfall; Not recognising that solutions must match the type of scarcity |
| **Secure** | Can evaluate water management strategies in contrasting contexts, assess the sustainability of different approaches, and analyse the connections between water insecurity and broader development challenges. | Evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of large-scale dam projects as a solution to water insecurity. Use named examples. (9 marks) | Evaluating dam projects only in terms of water supply without considering displacement, environmental damage and geopolitical implications; Not comparing large-scale solutions with small-scale alternatives |
| **Mastery** | Can analyse water insecurity as a geopolitical issue, evaluate the concept of 'virtual water' and water footprints, and assess whether water will become a major source of international conflict. | Will water scarcity lead to international conflict in the 21st century? Evaluate the evidence for and against this claim. | Either accepting or dismissing the water wars thesis uncritically without evaluating the evidence; Not considering the role of international cooperation and trade in managing water scarcity |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Some countries do not have enough water because it does not rain much there and it is very hot.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Physical water scarcity occurs when there is genuinely not enough water to meet demand due to low rainfall, limited river flow or depleted aquifers. For example, parts of the Middle East and North Africa receive very low rainfall and depend on desalination or groundwater extraction. Economic water scarcity occurs when water exists but infrastructure or governance prevents access. For example, parts of sub-Saharan Africa receive adequate rainfall but lack the pipes, pumps, treatment facilities and water management systems to deliver clean water to communities. This distinction is important because the solutions differ: physical scarcity requires supply-side solutions (desalination, water transfer), while economic scarcity requires investment in infrastructure and governance.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Large dams are among the most ambitious water management solutions but carry significant trade-offs. The Three Gorges Dam in China (completed 2006) provides flood control, hydroelectric power and water storage for irrigation, benefiting millions. However, it displaced approximately 1.3 million people, submerged culturally significant sites, disrupted downstream sediment supply (causing erosion), and altered the ecosystem of the Yangtze River. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (under construction) will provide electricity for Ethiopia's development and store water for irrigation, but downstream countries (Sudan, Egypt) fear reduced Nile flow, creating geopolitical tension. The Aswan High Dam in Egypt has provided irrigation water and electricity since the 1970s but has reduced the Nile's natural flood cycle, causing soil fertility decline in the delta and coastal erosion. The advantages of large dams are: reliable water storage across seasons, hydroelectric power (a renewable energy source), and flood control. The disadvantages are: massive population displacement, environmental damage, disruption of downstream ecosystems and sediment supply, geopolitical conflict over transboundary rivers, and very high construction costs. Small-scale alternatives (rainwater harvesting, borehole construction, improved irrigation efficiency) are less dramatic but may be more sustainable and equitable because they benefit local communities without the large-scale negative impacts. The most effective water management combines strategies at different scales, with large infrastructure for major supply needs and community-level solutions for local access.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *The 'water wars' thesis holds that as demand for water increases and supply becomes more uncertain (due to climate change, population growth and pollution), competition over shared water resources will generate international conflict. Evidence supporting this includes: over 260 river basins are shared by two or more countries, creating potential for dispute; the Jordan, Nile and Indus rivers are all sources of geopolitical tension; and climate change models predict reduced water availability in already water-stressed regions (the Middle East, Central Asia, the Sahel). However, the evidence against the water wars thesis is also substantial. Historically, water disputes have more often led to cooperation than conflict: international agreements on shared rivers (the Mekong River Commission, the Indus Waters Treaty) have been remarkably durable even during periods of wider conflict. The Indus Waters Treaty between India and Pakistan has survived three wars. The reason is that water is so essential that both sides have powerful incentives to negotiate rather than fight. The greater risk may be within-country conflict: competition between urban and agricultural water users, between upstream and downstream communities, and between wealthy and poor populations within the same country generates significant social tension. Climate change may intensify these domestic conflicts by reducing supply while demand continues to grow. The concept of 'virtual water' — the water embedded in traded goods (it takes 15,000 litres of water to produce 1kg of beef) — suggests that global trade effectively transfers water from water-rich to water-poor regions, reducing the pressure for direct conflict over physical water supplies. The most probable future involves increasing water stress generating political tension and local conflict, managed through a combination of international agreements, technological solutions (desalination, efficiency), demand reduction (pricing, regulation) and trade, rather than large-scale interstate war.*

### Secondary concept: Climate Change (GE-KS4-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The observed and projected changes to global climate systems, primarily driven by increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases from human activity. Encompasses the evidence base for climate change, the physical mechanisms involved, the differentiated impacts across global regions, and the range of mitigation and adaptation strategies.

#### Differentiation

### Secondary concept: Geographical Statistical Skills (GE-KS4-C010)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The selection, application, and interpretation of numerical and statistical techniques to process geographical data, identify patterns and correlations, test hypotheses, and evaluate the reliability of data sets.

## Thinking lens: Systems and System Models (primary)

**Key question:** What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?

**Why this lens fits:** Water insecurity arises where demand exceeds supply within a physical hydrological system constrained by climate, geology and land use; management strategies (dams, transfers, conservation) intervene in this system and pupils must evaluate their effectiveness and unintended environmental and social consequences.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- What assumptions does this model make, and how do they limit its predictions?
- Are there tipping points where small changes produce large systemic effects?
- How would you choose between two competing models of this system?
- Can this phenomenon be explained by looking at parts alone, or does it require a systems perspective?

**Secondary lens:** Stability and Change — The energy transition is explicitly a question of managed change — moving from a fossil-fuel-dependent system to a renewable one — and pupils must evaluate whether different transition strategies (rapid decarbonisation, phased replacement, carbon capture) represent achievable paths to a stable low-carbon energy system.

## Session structure: Case Study + Secondary Data Analysis

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Case Study (main structure)
An in-depth investigation of a specific real-world example, location, or scenario. Starts with locating and describing the case in context, collects and organises relevant data, analyses patterns and processes, compares with other cases where appropriate, and reaches an evaluative conclusion.

`locate_and_describe` → `introduction` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `comparison` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Written case study report with data presentation (tables, graphs, maps), analysis of findings, and evaluative conclusion that addresses the original enquiry question.

**Teacher note:** Use the CASE STUDY template: frame the case within a broader theoretical or conceptual context. Expect pupils to select and justify appropriate data collection methods. Guide critical analysis using subject-specific frameworks and quantitative techniques where appropriate. Demand evaluative conclusions that consider the typicality of the case and the generalisability of findings.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does this case illustrate or challenge the broader theory?
- What are the strengths and weaknesses of the data collection methods used?
- To what extent can we generalise from this case study?
- How would you evaluate the significance of your findings in the wider context?

### Secondary Data Analysis
An enquiry using existing published data sets rather than first-hand collection. Pupils frame an enquiry question, select and evaluate appropriate data sources, process and present data using statistical or graphical methods, analyse patterns and anomalies, evaluate reliability, and present findings.

`question_framing` → `data_selection` → `processing` → `analysis` → `evaluation` → `presentation`

**Assessment:** Data analysis report including processed data presented in appropriate formats, statistical analysis where relevant, interpretation of findings, and evaluation of data reliability and limitations.

**Teacher note:** Use the SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS template: expect pupils to independently select, evaluate, and process secondary data using statistical or analytical techniques. Demand critical assessment of data quality, collection methodology, potential biases, and the validity of conclusions drawn from secondary analysis. Guide formal presentation of findings with appropriate acknowledgement of uncertainty.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How would you evaluate the reliability and validity of this secondary dataset?
- What analytical techniques are most appropriate for this data, and why?
- What biases or limitations in the original data collection might affect your conclusions?
- How would you present your findings with appropriate acknowledgement of uncertainty?

## Contrasting localities

### UAE vs Iraq: Oil Wealth and Development Paths
The UAE-Iraq contrast within the same region demonstrates that resource wealth does not automatically translate into development. The comparison requires analysis of governance, conflict, diversification, and international relations as mediating factors between resource endowment and development outcome, building evaluative geographical thinking.

**Compare through:** GDP per capita, economic diversification, governance stability, infrastructure development, conflict history, international relations
**Stimulus questions:**
- Both countries have vast oil reserves. Why is the UAE so much richer than Iraq?
- Is the UAE's rapid modernisation sustainable without oil?
- What role has conflict played in Iraq's development path?
- Can oil-rich countries avoid the resource curse? What does the evidence suggest?

## Why this study matters

Resource Management extends KS3 work on UK water into GCSE-level global analysis of water insecurity and energy security. Pupils study the overview of food/water/energy challenges in the UK, then explore one resource in depth with global case studies. The study links physical geography (climate, hydrology) with human geography (development, governance, technology) and evaluates management strategies for sustainability.

## Sequencing

**Follows:** Resource Management: UK Water

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Treating resource insecurity as only a developing-world problem — the UK faces its own water and energy challenges
2. Presenting renewable energy as a simple replacement for fossil fuels without analysing intermittency, cost and land-use trade-offs
3. Focusing on supply-side solutions (more dams, more wind farms) without analysing demand-side management (reducing waste, changing behaviour)

## Sensitive content

- Energy poverty affects UK households — some pupils may experience fuel poverty directly
- Water insecurity in LICs involves preventable disease and death — handle factually and with empathy
- Energy policy debates (fracking, nuclear) are politically sensitive — present evidence from multiple perspectives

---

## Success criteria

**Pupils can:**
- Explain the global pattern and causes of water insecurity
- Evaluate supply-side and demand-side strategies for water management
- Analyse the UK's changing energy mix using data
- Evaluate the costs and benefits of different energy sources (fossil, nuclear, renewable)

## Geographical skills (KS4)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Using maps, atlases and globes** — Locating and identifying places in the United Kingdom and wider world using world maps, atlases and globes as reference tools, understanding that these are representations of the real world at reduced scale.
- **Using compass directions and locational language** — Applying the four cardinal compass directions (North, South, East, West) and everyday directional language such as near, far, left and right to describe the location of features and routes on maps and in the environment.
- **Using aerial photographs and making simple maps** — Interpreting aerial photographs and plan-perspective images to recognise landmarks and physical and human features, and translating these observations into a simple hand-drawn map with a basic symbol key.
- **Simple fieldwork and observational skills** — Going out into the school grounds and immediate surrounding environment to observe, describe and record human and physical geographical features at first hand, practising the habits of direct geographical enquiry.
- **Using maps, atlases, globes and digital mapping** — Extending atlas and map use to locate countries and describe the features studied across the curriculum, and beginning to use digital and computer mapping tools — including online satellite maps — to access geographical information in a range of formats.
- **Eight-point compass and Ordnance Survey map skills** — Applying the eight compass points, four-figure and six-figure grid references, and the symbols and conventions of Ordnance Survey maps to build knowledge of the UK and the wider world, and to navigate and locate features on topographic maps.
