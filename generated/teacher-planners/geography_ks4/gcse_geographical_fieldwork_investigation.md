## Enquiry questions

1. How do we use geographical fieldwork to test hypotheses and draw valid conclusions?

---

## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Geographical Fieldwork Enquiry (GE-KS4-C008)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The systematic process of geographical investigation in the field, including the formulation of enquiry questions, selection and justification of data collection methods, collection of primary physical and human data, processing and presentation of data, analysis of patterns and anomalies, and critical evaluation of methodology and conclusions.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach the geographical enquiry process as a cycle with five stages: (1) identifying the enquiry question (a geographical question that requires primary data to answer); (2) selecting appropriate methods (quantitative and qualitative, primary and secondary, with justification for choices); (3) collecting data (using appropriate equipment and sampling strategies); (4) processing and presenting data (selecting appropriate graphical and statistical techniques); (5) analysis, conclusions, and evaluation (explaining patterns, testing against the hypothesis, evaluating reliability and validity). GCSE Paper 3 tests fieldwork knowledge both for the students' own enquiries and for unfamiliar fieldwork contexts. Students must be able to name specific methods (e.g. 'systematic sampling at 10m intervals', 'bipolar evaluation checklist') rather than vague descriptions, and must critically evaluate their methods' limitations.

**Key vocabulary:** geographical enquiry, primary data, secondary data, qualitative data, quantitative data, hypothesis, sampling, systematic sampling, random sampling, stratified sampling, bias, accuracy, reliability, validity, anomaly, correlation, conclusion, methodology

**Common misconceptions:** Students frequently describe their fieldwork methods without justifying why those methods were appropriate for their enquiry question. Students often present their conclusions without linking them explicitly back to their data, or without acknowledging anomalies and limitations in their findings. Students sometimes confuse accuracy (whether measurements are correct) with reliability (whether results are reproducible and representative), and validity (whether the data actually answers the enquiry question).

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can describe what happened during fieldwork (where they went, what they measured) but cannot explain why specific methods were chosen or evaluate the quality of their data. | Describe what you did during your river fieldwork. | Describing activities without explaining why they were done; Not connecting fieldwork methods to an enquiry question |
| **Developing** | Can explain the purpose of fieldwork methods, link them to an enquiry question, present data using appropriate techniques, and identify basic patterns in results. | Explain why you used systematic sampling at your coastal fieldwork site and describe one advantage and one disadvantage of this approach. (4 marks) | Choosing a sampling method without being able to justify why it is appropriate; Not identifying the limitations of the chosen approach |
| **Secure** | Can plan and justify a complete fieldwork enquiry, select appropriate data collection and analysis methods, draw evidence-based conclusions, and critically evaluate the methodology. | Evaluate the reliability and validity of the data you collected during your fieldwork investigation. Suggest how the investigation could be improved. (6 marks) | Claiming data is reliable without identifying specific sources of error; Suggesting improvements without explaining how they would address the specific limitations identified |
| **Mastery** | Can transfer enquiry skills to unfamiliar contexts, critically evaluate fieldwork methodology at a conceptual level, and explain how fieldwork evidence relates to geographical theory. | You are given data from an unfamiliar fieldwork investigation. The data shows that environmental quality scores decrease with distance from a park. Evaluate the methodology used and suggest how you would investigate this relationship more thoroughly. | Accepting the correlation as evidence of causation without considering alternative explanations; Not considering how to test the relationship more rigorously through comparative or longitudinal methods |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *We went to a river and measured the width and depth. We also measured how fast the water was flowing using a flow meter.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *We used systematic sampling (measuring every 5 metres along the beach) because it gives regular, evenly-spaced data points that allow us to identify spatial patterns in pebble size along the beach. This is better for our enquiry question ('How does sediment size change along the beach?') than random sampling, which might miss important areas. One advantage is that systematic sampling ensures even coverage of the whole study area, making the data more representative. One disadvantage is that it might miss important variations between sampling points — if a significant change in sediment size occurs between two sampling points, we would not detect it.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Our investigation tested whether river velocity increases downstream. The data was reasonably reliable because we took three readings at each site and calculated the mean, reducing the impact of anomalous readings. However, reliability was limited by several factors: the flow meter was difficult to hold steady in faster currents, producing variable readings; weather conditions changed during the day (rain increased discharge at later sites); and we could only measure at accessible points rather than at evenly-spaced intervals. Validity was affected by our small sample size (5 sites along a 3km stretch) — this may not be enough to identify a clear trend, particularly where local factors (bridges, vegetation, tributary inputs) disrupted the overall pattern. To improve the investigation, I would: increase the number of sites to at least 10; revisit the same sites on different days to account for weather variation; use a more precise method (electromagnetic flow meter rather than an impeller); and collect additional data (channel cross-section, gradient) to explain the velocity patterns observed. The overall conclusion (velocity increases downstream) was supported by 4 of 5 sites, but the anomalous site 3 (where a weir slowed flow) demonstrates that local factors can override the general trend.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *The methodology is a radial transect from a park, using a bipolar environmental quality survey at regular intervals. Several methodological questions need addressing. First, the environmental quality index (EQI) is subjective — different surveyors might score the same location differently. To improve reliability, the survey should be conducted by multiple surveyors at each point and scores averaged, or a more objective scoring rubric should be used. Second, the transect represents only one direction from the park; the pattern might differ in different directions depending on land use, road proximity and socioeconomic factors. Multiple transects in different directions would test whether the pattern is consistent. Third, the relationship might be correlational rather than causal: the park might be located in an area of high environmental quality for reasons unrelated to the park itself (e.g. a wealthy neighbourhood), meaning the park is not causing the pattern but is associated with it. To investigate causality, I would compare the environmental quality gradient around multiple parks in different contexts (wealthy vs deprived areas; large vs small parks; urban vs suburban parks) to test whether the pattern holds regardless of context. I would also collect secondary data (house prices, deprivation indices, population density) to control for socioeconomic factors. To test whether the park itself causes the gradient, I would compare the gradient before and after a new park was created to see if environmental quality improved following park development. This multi-method approach would provide stronger evidence for or against the causal claim.*

### Secondary concept: River Landscapes and Processes (GE-KS4-C003)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The physical processes of erosion (hydraulic action, abrasion, attrition, solution), transportation (traction, saltation, suspension, solution), and deposition that shape river channels and valleys at different stages of a river's long profile, producing characteristic landforms in upper, middle, and lower course environments.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify that rivers shape the land and that different features exist at different points along a river, but cannot explain the processes that create specific landforms. | Naming landforms without knowing where they occur along the river or how they form; Confusing erosional and depositional landforms |
| **Developing** | Can describe the processes of erosion, transportation and deposition, explain how specific landforms are created, and locate them along the river's long profile. | Describing the appearance of a waterfall without explaining the formation process step by step; Not explaining how the differential erosion of hard and soft rock creates the overhang |
| **Secure** | Can construct detailed explanations of landform formation using correct process terminology, explain how the river system changes along its course, and evaluate management strategies. | Describing what meanders look like without explaining the erosion and deposition processes that form them; Not explaining the connection between velocity, erosion on the outside, and deposition on the inside of the bend |
| **Mastery** | Can apply the systems approach to river landscapes, analyse how human intervention alters natural processes, and evaluate the long-term sustainability of different river management strategies. | Presenting hard and soft engineering as simple alternatives without recognising that integrated approaches are usually most effective; Not applying the systems concept to explain why interventions at one point affect processes elsewhere |

### Secondary concept: Coastal Processes and Management (GE-KS4-C004)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The physical processes of wave action, longshore drift, erosion, transportation, and deposition that shape coastlines, producing distinctive landforms in areas of hard and soft rock geology, and the strategies used to manage coastal erosion, flooding, and change.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify that the sea shapes the coast and that different features exist (cliffs, beaches) but cannot explain the processes of wave action or longshore drift. | Using vague language ('the sea crashes') without naming specific erosion processes; Not distinguishing between different types of erosion |
| **Developing** | Can name and explain the four types of erosion, describe longshore drift, and explain how erosional and depositional landforms are created with supporting detail. | Explaining bay formation without explaining why headlands remain; Not mentioning wave refraction and its role in concentrating energy on headlands |
| **Secure** | Can explain the full sequence of erosional landform development (headlands, caves, arches, stacks, stumps), evaluate coastal management strategies against multiple criteria, and use named examples. | Listing advantages and disadvantages without making a judgement about which approach is most appropriate in which context; Not recognising that coastal management at one location affects erosion at neighbouring locations |
| **Mastery** | Can apply coastal systems thinking to evaluate management decisions, analyse the interaction between physical processes and human values in coastal management debates, and assess how climate change is altering coastal risk. | Treating the question as purely technical rather than recognising its ethical and political dimensions; Not connecting the management debate to the physical reality of coastal systems and sediment cells |

### Secondary concept: Cartographic and Map Skills (GE-KS4-C009)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

The ability to read, interpret, construct, and critically evaluate a range of map types including OS maps, atlas maps, choropleth maps, dot maps, isoline maps, flow-line maps, and GIS-based digital maps, to answer geographical questions about location, distribution, pattern, and spatial relationship.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can use a simple map to identify features and give basic directions, but struggles with grid references, contour interpretation and scale calculations. | Reversing eastings and northings in grid references; Not understanding what contour lines represent |
| **Developing** | Can use four and six-figure grid references accurately, interpret basic contour patterns to describe relief, use scale to measure distances, and identify land use patterns from map symbols. | Describing what is on the map without interpreting what it means geographically (e.g. describing contour lines without interpreting relief); Not using specific heights from contour lines |
| **Secure** | Can construct and interpret a range of map types (choropleth, isoline, proportional), use maps to answer geographical questions, and evaluate the advantages and limitations of different cartographic techniques. | Describing each map type without comparing their relative strengths; Not recognising that choropleth maps can be misleading because they imply uniform distribution within areas |
| **Mastery** | Can critically evaluate how cartographic choices shape the viewer's understanding, use GIS as an analytical tool, and recognise how maps can both reveal and conceal geographical realities. | Treating maps as objective representations of reality rather than as constructed artefacts that involve choices; Not considering how the same data could be mapped differently to convey different messages |

### Secondary concept: Geographical Statistical Skills (GE-KS4-C010)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The selection, application, and interpretation of numerical and statistical techniques to process geographical data, identify patterns and correlations, test hypotheses, and evaluate the reliability of data sets.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can calculate simple averages and read basic graphs, but struggles with more advanced statistical techniques and cannot interpret statistical results in geographical terms. | Making arithmetic errors in calculating the mean; Not understanding when the mean is an appropriate measure (e.g. it is distorted by outliers) |
| **Developing** | Can calculate mean, median, range and interquartile range, construct scatter graphs, and describe correlations in geographical terms. | Describing the statistical pattern without giving a geographical explanation; Not identifying and attempting to explain anomalies |
| **Secure** | Can calculate and interpret Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, test results against significance tables, and use statistical evidence to support geographical arguments. | Calculating Spearman's rank without testing the result against the critical value for significance; Stating that correlation proves causation rather than indicating a relationship |
| **Mastery** | Can select and justify appropriate statistical techniques for different types of data, critically evaluate the limitations of statistical analysis in geography, and use statistics as evidence within broader geographical arguments. | Treating statistical significance as proof rather than as evidence that supports a hypothesis; Not recognising the limitations of applying statistical techniques to small fieldwork datasets |

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** Fieldwork enquiry is typically organised around detecting and explaining spatial or temporal patterns in a local environment (vegetation along a transect, pedestrian counts in a town centre, pebble size down a beach); identifying whether patterns are present and what processes explain them is the core investigative task.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- How would you formalise this pattern mathematically?
- What are the limits of this pattern — where does it break down?
- Could this pattern be an artefact of how the data was collected?
- Does identifying the pattern tell us why it occurs?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Fieldwork is the complete evidence-to-argument cycle in geography — pupils formulate a hypothesis, design data collection methods, gather primary evidence, and construct a conclusion that the evidence does or does not support; evaluating the reliability of their methods is central to the cognitive demand.

---

## Session structure: Fieldwork

### Fieldwork
Learning through direct observation and data collection in the field (or simulated field environment). Includes preparation and planning, systematic data collection using fieldwork techniques, data processing and presentation, analysis of findings, and a conclusion that addresses the enquiry question.

`preparation` → `field_data_collection` → `processing` → `analysis` → `conclusion`

**Assessment:** Fieldwork report including methodology, data presentation using appropriate techniques (maps, graphs, tables, photographs), analysis of patterns, and conclusion with evaluation of data reliability.

**Teacher note:** Use the FIELDWORK template: expect pupils to design a fieldwork methodology with justified sampling, appropriate quantitative and qualitative techniques, and risk assessment. Demand rigorous data processing including statistical analysis where appropriate. Guide critical evaluation of methodology, data quality, and conclusions, with reference to how fieldwork evidence supports or challenges geographical or scientific theory.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does your sampling strategy ensure your data is representative?
- What statistical techniques will you use to analyse your field data?
- How do your fieldwork conclusions relate to the broader geographical or scientific theory?
- What methodological improvements would strengthen your investigation?

## Study scope

**Scale:** Local
**Themes:** enquiry process, hypothesis testing, primary data collection, statistical analysis, evaluation

**Map types:** os map, gis, topographic, sketch map
**Data sources:** Primary data collected by pupils, Digimap for Schools, ONS Neighbourhood Statistics, Environment Agency

**Fieldwork potential:** This IS the fieldwork study. Pupils conduct two investigations: typically one physical (river, coast) and one human (urban, retail). Each investigation follows the full enquiry cycle from question to evaluation.

**Assessment guidance:** Can pupils design a fieldwork investigation with a clear hypothesis and appropriate methodology? Can they select and justify appropriate data collection techniques? Can they present data using appropriate statistical and cartographic methods? Can they analyse results using statistical techniques and evaluate the reliability of their conclusions?

## Why this study matters

GCSE fieldwork is mandatory and assessed in the written exam: pupils must have completed two fieldwork investigations in contrasting environments (one physical, one human is typical). The study develops the full enquiry cycle: question → hypothesis → methodology → data collection → presentation → analysis → conclusion → evaluation. GCSE demands statistical analysis (Spearman's rank, chi-squared) that goes beyond KS3 fieldwork.

## Sequencing

**Follows:** Geographical Fieldwork Investigation

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Treating fieldwork as a data-collection day out rather than a genuine geographical enquiry driven by a question and hypothesis
2. Teaching statistical techniques in isolation rather than as tools for testing geographical hypotheses
3. Failing to teach evaluation skills — pupils must critically assess the reliability and accuracy of their own data and conclusions

---

## Success criteria

**Pupils can:**
- Design a geographical enquiry with a clear hypothesis and justified methodology
- Select and use appropriate sampling strategies and data collection techniques
- Present data using statistical diagrams, maps and GIS
- Analyse data using statistical techniques (Spearman's rank, chi-squared)
- Evaluate the reliability and accuracy of data and conclusions

## Geographical skills (KS4)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Using maps, atlases and globes** — Locating and identifying places in the United Kingdom and wider world using world maps, atlases and globes as reference tools, understanding that these are representations of the real world at reduced scale.
- **Using compass directions and locational language** — Applying the four cardinal compass directions (North, South, East, West) and everyday directional language such as near, far, left and right to describe the location of features and routes on maps and in the environment.
- **Using aerial photographs and making simple maps** — Interpreting aerial photographs and plan-perspective images to recognise landmarks and physical and human features, and translating these observations into a simple hand-drawn map with a basic symbol key.
- **Simple fieldwork and observational skills** — Going out into the school grounds and immediate surrounding environment to observe, describe and record human and physical geographical features at first hand, practising the habits of direct geographical enquiry.
- **Using maps, atlases, globes and digital mapping** — Extending atlas and map use to locate countries and describe the features studied across the curriculum, and beginning to use digital and computer mapping tools — including online satellite maps — to access geographical information in a range of formats.
- **Eight-point compass and Ordnance Survey map skills** — Applying the eight compass points, four-figure and six-figure grid references, and the symbols and conventions of Ordnance Survey maps to build knowledge of the UK and the wider world, and to navigate and locate features on topographic maps.
