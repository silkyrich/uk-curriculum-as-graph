---

## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Tropical Storms and Extreme Weather (GE-KS4-C011)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The atmospheric processes that produce tropical cyclones (hurricanes, typhoons), their global distribution and seasonal patterns, their structure and the sequence of impacts as they make landfall, and the differential impacts on communities with different levels of preparedness and economic development.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach the formation conditions systematically: ocean temperature above 27°C, position more than 5° from the equator (for Coriolis effect), low wind shear allowing the storm to develop vertically. The structure of a tropical storm (spiral bands, eye wall, eye) should be drawn and annotated. Use named case studies at contrasting development levels to explore differential impacts: death tolls, economic damage, displacement, infrastructure damage, and effectiveness of response. The link between climate change and tropical storms is an important analytical connection: warmer ocean temperatures may increase storm intensity even if storm frequency does not change. For assessment, practise 'describe the global distribution of tropical storms' (using a map — identify latitude zone, list ocean basins, note absence near equator) and 'explain why tropical storms cause more deaths in some countries than others' (6 marks).

**Key vocabulary:** tropical storm, hurricane, typhoon, cyclone, Coriolis effect, eye, eye wall, storm surge, rainfall, latent heat, trade winds, storm track, landfall, evacuation, storm preparedness, Saffir-Simpson scale

**Common misconceptions:** Students frequently state that tropical storms form over warm water without explaining the full formation mechanism (including the role of low wind shear, the Coriolis effect for rotation, and convection). Students often attribute the greater death toll in LICs solely to poverty without specifying how poverty translates into vulnerability (poor building quality, inadequate early warning systems, inability to evacuate, less effective emergency response). Students sometimes assume that the eye of a tropical storm is safe, without understanding that the calm in the eye is temporary and the eye wall brings the storm's worst conditions.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify that tropical storms are powerful weather events but cannot explain their formation, structure or global distribution. | What is a tropical storm? | Describing the effects without explaining the cause or formation; Not knowing that tropical storms have different names in different regions |
| **Developing** | Can explain the formation conditions and structure of tropical storms, describe their global distribution, and explain their impacts using a named example. | Explain the conditions needed for a tropical storm to form. (4 marks) | Listing formation conditions without explaining why each is necessary; Not explaining why tropical storms cannot form at the equator |
| **Secure** | Can analyse the differential impacts of tropical storms in contrasting development contexts, evaluate management strategies, and explain the link between climate change and tropical storm activity. | Compare the impacts of and responses to Typhoon Haiyan (Philippines, 2013) and Hurricane Sandy (USA, 2012). Explain why the impacts differed. (9 marks) | Comparing only the death tolls without analysing the specific factors that explain the difference; Not recognising that economic damage can be higher in wealthy countries while deaths are higher in poor countries |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate the relationship between climate change and tropical storm activity critically, assess the concept of 'natural' disaster, and analyse how vulnerability and resilience interact to determine outcomes. | Is it accurate to describe tropical storms as 'natural disasters'? Evaluate this term using your geographical knowledge. | Accepting the term 'natural disaster' uncritically without analysing the human factors that determine impact; Going too far in the other direction and ignoring the role of physical hazard intensity |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *A tropical storm is a very powerful storm with strong winds and heavy rain. They can cause lots of damage.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Tropical storms need several conditions: sea surface temperatures above 27 degrees C to provide the energy through evaporation; a location at least 5 degrees north or south of the equator so the Coriolis effect can create rotation; low wind shear (small difference in wind speed and direction at different altitudes) so the storm can develop vertically without being torn apart; and existing areas of low atmospheric pressure to initiate the upward convection of warm, moist air. These conditions explain why tropical storms form in specific ocean basins (western Atlantic, western Pacific, Indian Ocean) during late summer when sea temperatures are highest.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Typhoon Haiyan killed over 6,000 people in the Philippines, displaced 4 million, and destroyed 1 million homes. Storm surges of up to 5 metres devastated coastal communities in Tacloban. The response was hampered by destroyed infrastructure (roads, airports, communications), limited government resources, and the remote location of many affected communities. International aid was substantial but slow to reach those in need. Hurricane Sandy killed 233 people across the Caribbean and USA. In the USA specifically, 72 deaths occurred and economic damage exceeded $65 billion (higher than Haiyan's $2 billion). Sandy caused a massive storm surge in New York City, flooding subway tunnels and coastal neighbourhoods. The response was more effective due to better infrastructure, emergency services and financial resources, though low-income communities (particularly in New Jersey) faced prolonged displacement. The key difference in death toll reflects the development gap: the Philippines had lower building quality, less effective early warning systems, fewer evacuation resources, and weaker emergency response capacity. The higher economic damage in the USA reflects the greater value of assets in wealthy countries — the same storm intensity destroys more valuable infrastructure. Climate change may increase the intensity (though not necessarily frequency) of tropical storms by providing warmer ocean temperatures and more atmospheric moisture, potentially making future events more damaging.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *The term 'natural disaster' is widely used but geographically misleading because it implies that the destruction caused by tropical storms is a product of natural forces alone. In reality, the impact of a tropical storm is determined by the interaction between the physical hazard (wind speed, rainfall, storm surge) and human vulnerability (building quality, warning systems, evacuation capacity, economic resilience). The same physical event produces very different outcomes in different human contexts: Category 4 Hurricane Harvey (USA, 2017) killed 68 people; Category 4 Cyclone Nargis (Myanmar, 2008) killed 138,000. The difference is not in the storms but in the societies they struck. This insight has led many geographers to prefer the term 'disaster' without the qualifier 'natural', emphasising that disasters are socially produced through choices about where to build, what building codes to enforce, how to invest in warning systems, and how to distribute resources for preparedness and response. The concept of vulnerability recognises that some populations are more at risk because of poverty, marginalisation, location and governance failures — none of which are 'natural'. The concept of resilience describes a community's capacity to prepare for, respond to and recover from hazard events, which depends on social, economic and political factors. This does not mean the physical event is unimportant — a more intense storm causes more damage in any context — but it means that the human dimensions of disaster (vulnerability, resilience, preparedness, inequality) are as important as the physical dimensions, and possibly more amenable to intervention.*

### Secondary concept: Tectonic Hazards (GE-KS4-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The study of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions as hazards arising from processes at tectonic plate boundaries. Encompasses the physical processes of plate movement and magma activity, the global distribution of hazard zones, the differential impacts of tectonic events on communities with different levels of economic development, and the effectiveness of prediction, preparedness, and response strategies.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify that earthquakes and volcanoes are natural hazards and that they occur at plate boundaries, but cannot explain the processes at different boundary types or the factors affecting impact. | Confusing the three types of plate boundary; Not explaining why different hazards occur at different boundary types |
| **Developing** | Can explain the processes at each plate boundary type, describe the effects of a tectonic event using a named example, and identify factors that affect the severity of impacts. | Attributing the difference in deaths solely to the magnitude of the earthquake; Not explaining the specific mechanisms by which development level affects vulnerability |
| **Secure** | Can construct detailed analytical responses comparing tectonic events in contrasting development contexts, evaluating the effectiveness of management strategies using specific evidence. | Describing management strategies without evaluating their effectiveness; Not recognising that the effectiveness of strategies depends on the development context |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate the concept of hazard vulnerability critically, analyse the interaction between physical processes and human factors in determining outcomes, and assess whether tectonic hazards are becoming more or less dangerous over time. | Confusing changes in physical hazard frequency with changes in human vulnerability; Not recognising that development level is the key variable determining whether tectonic events become disasters |

### Secondary concept: Climate Change (GE-KS4-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The observed and projected changes to global climate systems, primarily driven by increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases from human activity. Encompasses the evidence base for climate change, the physical mechanisms involved, the differentiated impacts across global regions, and the range of mitigation and adaptation strategies.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can state that the world is getting warmer and that this is caused by greenhouse gases, but cannot explain the enhanced greenhouse effect mechanism or distinguish between mitigation and adaptation. | Using vague language like 'pollution' without specifying greenhouse gases; Not explaining the mechanism of the greenhouse effect |
| **Developing** | Can explain the enhanced greenhouse effect using specific terminology, cite evidence for climate change, and describe the difference between mitigation and adaptation strategies. | Confusing mitigation (reducing causes) with adaptation (managing consequences); Not giving specific, concrete examples of each strategy |
| **Secure** | Can analyse the evidence for climate change using multiple data sources, evaluate the geographically differentiated impacts, and assess management strategies at different scales with substantiated judgements. | Describing what agreements say without evaluating their actual effectiveness; Not considering the equity dimension of international climate negotiations |
| **Mastery** | Can critically evaluate the scientific, political and economic dimensions of climate change, assess the interactions between different response strategies, and construct original arguments about the geographical implications of different warming scenarios. | Presenting the 1.5 degree target as either easily achievable or completely impossible, rather than analysing the specific barriers; Not recognising that the consequences of different warming levels are geographically differentiated |

### Secondary concept: Cartographic and Map Skills (GE-KS4-C009)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

The ability to read, interpret, construct, and critically evaluate a range of map types including OS maps, atlas maps, choropleth maps, dot maps, isoline maps, flow-line maps, and GIS-based digital maps, to answer geographical questions about location, distribution, pattern, and spatial relationship.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can use a simple map to identify features and give basic directions, but struggles with grid references, contour interpretation and scale calculations. | Reversing eastings and northings in grid references; Not understanding what contour lines represent |
| **Developing** | Can use four and six-figure grid references accurately, interpret basic contour patterns to describe relief, use scale to measure distances, and identify land use patterns from map symbols. | Describing what is on the map without interpreting what it means geographically (e.g. describing contour lines without interpreting relief); Not using specific heights from contour lines |
| **Secure** | Can construct and interpret a range of map types (choropleth, isoline, proportional), use maps to answer geographical questions, and evaluate the advantages and limitations of different cartographic techniques. | Describing each map type without comparing their relative strengths; Not recognising that choropleth maps can be misleading because they imply uniform distribution within areas |
| **Mastery** | Can critically evaluate how cartographic choices shape the viewer's understanding, use GIS as an analytical tool, and recognise how maps can both reveal and conceal geographical realities. | Treating maps as objective representations of reality rather than as constructed artefacts that involve choices; Not considering how the same data could be mapped differently to convey different messages |

### Secondary concept: Geographical Statistical Skills (GE-KS4-C010)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The selection, application, and interpretation of numerical and statistical techniques to process geographical data, identify patterns and correlations, test hypotheses, and evaluate the reliability of data sets.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can calculate simple averages and read basic graphs, but struggles with more advanced statistical techniques and cannot interpret statistical results in geographical terms. | Making arithmetic errors in calculating the mean; Not understanding when the mean is an appropriate measure (e.g. it is distorted by outliers) |
| **Developing** | Can calculate mean, median, range and interquartile range, construct scatter graphs, and describe correlations in geographical terms. | Describing the statistical pattern without giving a geographical explanation; Not identifying and attempting to explain anomalies |
| **Secure** | Can calculate and interpret Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, test results against significance tables, and use statistical evidence to support geographical arguments. | Calculating Spearman's rank without testing the result against the critical value for significance; Stating that correlation proves causation rather than indicating a relationship |
| **Mastery** | Can select and justify appropriate statistical techniques for different types of data, critically evaluate the limitations of statistical analysis in geography, and use statistics as evidence within broader geographical arguments. | Treating statistical significance as proof rather than as evidence that supports a hypothesis; Not recognising the limitations of applying statistical techniques to small fieldwork datasets |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Tectonic hazards analysis requires pupils to trace the causal chain from plate boundary type through earthquake or eruption mechanism to primary and secondary impacts, then evaluate whether management strategies can interrupt the chain — cause-and-effect reasoning is the explicit cognitive demand.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- Is this a necessary cause, a sufficient cause, or a contributing factor?
- What confounding variables could explain this relationship?
- How would you design an investigation to establish causation, not just correlation?
- In this causal chain, where could an intervention have the most effect?

**Secondary lens:** Systems and System Models — Comparing management strategies in contrasting global contexts requires pupils to model how socioeconomic systems interact with physical hazard risk — why the same magnitude earthquake kills thousands in one country and hundreds in another depends on system-level factors like building codes, emergency response and land use.

## Session structure: Case Study + Secondary Data Analysis

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Case Study (main structure)
An in-depth investigation of a specific real-world example, location, or scenario. Starts with locating and describing the case in context, collects and organises relevant data, analyses patterns and processes, compares with other cases where appropriate, and reaches an evaluative conclusion.

`locate_and_describe` → `introduction` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `comparison` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Written case study report with data presentation (tables, graphs, maps), analysis of findings, and evaluative conclusion that addresses the original enquiry question.

**Teacher note:** Use the CASE STUDY template: frame the case within a broader theoretical or conceptual context. Expect pupils to select and justify appropriate data collection methods. Guide critical analysis using subject-specific frameworks and quantitative techniques where appropriate. Demand evaluative conclusions that consider the typicality of the case and the generalisability of findings.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does this case illustrate or challenge the broader theory?
- What are the strengths and weaknesses of the data collection methods used?
- To what extent can we generalise from this case study?
- How would you evaluate the significance of your findings in the wider context?

### Secondary Data Analysis
An enquiry using existing published data sets rather than first-hand collection. Pupils frame an enquiry question, select and evaluate appropriate data sources, process and present data using statistical or graphical methods, analyse patterns and anomalies, evaluate reliability, and present findings.

`question_framing` → `data_selection` → `processing` → `analysis` → `evaluation` → `presentation`

**Assessment:** Data analysis report including processed data presented in appropriate formats, statistical analysis where relevant, interpretation of findings, and evaluation of data reliability and limitations.

**Teacher note:** Use the SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS template: expect pupils to independently select, evaluate, and process secondary data using statistical or analytical techniques. Demand critical assessment of data quality, collection methodology, potential biases, and the validity of conclusions drawn from secondary analysis. Guide formal presentation of findings with appropriate acknowledgement of uncertainty.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How would you evaluate the reliability and validity of this secondary dataset?
- What analytical techniques are most appropriate for this data, and why?
- What biases or limitations in the original data collection might affect your conclusions?
- How would you present your findings with appropriate acknowledgement of uncertainty?

## Why this study matters

Weather hazards and climate change extend KS3 work on atmospheric processes into GCSE-level analysis of tropical storms (formation, impacts, management) and extreme UK weather events. Climate change is integrated here because it links atmospheric science to human geography through the concepts of mitigation, adaptation, and climate justice. Named tropical storm case studies (e.g. Typhoon Haiyan 2013) and UK extreme weather events (e.g. Somerset Levels 2014) are standard exam board requirements.

## Sequencing

**Follows:** Climate Change: Causes, Evidence and Mitigation

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Teaching tropical storm formation as rote memorisation of conditions rather than understanding WHY warm oceans drive storm development
2. Treating climate change as 'controversial' when the scientific consensus is clear — the debate is about RESPONSE, not the science
3. Failing to distinguish between weather (short-term) and climate (long-term) when discussing climate change evidence

## Sensitive content

- Climate anxiety is real for many young people — frame with agency, solutions and scientific evidence
- Tropical storms disproportionately affect LICs — avoid deficit framing; discuss structural causes of vulnerability
- UK flooding events may have directly affected pupils or their communities

---

## Success criteria

**Pupils can:**
- Explain tropical storm formation with process vocabulary
- Analyse impacts and responses of a named tropical storm case study
- Explain causes of an extreme UK weather event and evaluate the response
- Evaluate evidence for climate change and compare mitigation vs adaptation strategies

---

## Geographical skills (KS4)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Using maps, atlases and globes** — Locating and identifying places in the United Kingdom and wider world using world maps, atlases and globes as reference tools, understanding that these are representations of the real world at reduced scale.
- **Using compass directions and locational language** — Applying the four cardinal compass directions (North, South, East, West) and everyday directional language such as near, far, left and right to describe the location of features and routes on maps and in the environment.
- **Using aerial photographs and making simple maps** — Interpreting aerial photographs and plan-perspective images to recognise landmarks and physical and human features, and translating these observations into a simple hand-drawn map with a basic symbol key.
- **Simple fieldwork and observational skills** — Going out into the school grounds and immediate surrounding environment to observe, describe and record human and physical geographical features at first hand, practising the habits of direct geographical enquiry.
- **Using maps, atlases, globes and digital mapping** — Extending atlas and map use to locate countries and describe the features studied across the curriculum, and beginning to use digital and computer mapping tools — including online satellite maps — to access geographical information in a range of formats.
- **Eight-point compass and Ordnance Survey map skills** — Applying the eight compass points, four-figure and six-figure grid references, and the symbols and conventions of Ordnance Survey maps to build knowledge of the UK and the wider world, and to navigate and locate features on topographic maps.
