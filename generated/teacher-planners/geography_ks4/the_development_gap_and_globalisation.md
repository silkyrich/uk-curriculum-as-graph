## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: The Development Gap (GE-KS4-C006)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The disparity in wealth, economic opportunity, health outcomes, and living standards between the world's richest and poorest countries, measured through a range of development indicators, and explained by the interaction of physical, historical, economic, and political factors.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach students to use and evaluate a range of development indicators: single indicators (GNI per capita is economic only; infant mortality rate reflects healthcare provision; literacy rate reflects educational investment) and composite indices (HDI combines income, education, and life expectancy — better for capturing multi-dimensional development). The causes of the development gap should be analysed at multiple scales: physical (climate, landlocked status, natural disaster vulnerability), historical (colonialism and its long-term economic legacy), trade (unequal terms of trade, commodity dependence, tariff barriers), and political (governance quality, corruption, conflict). Strategies for closing the gap should be evaluated against criteria of sustainability, local appropriateness, and dependency creation: aid (emergency vs development), trade reform (Fairtrade, WTO), FDI, microfinance, debt relief, intermediate technology.

**Key vocabulary:** development, GNI per capita, HDI, infant mortality, literacy rate, life expectancy, development gap, North-South divide, colonialism, trade deficit, commodity dependence, Fairtrade, FDI, microfinance, debt relief, intermediate technology, Brandt line

**Common misconceptions:** Students frequently equate development solely with economic wealth (GNI per capita), overlooking social dimensions of development such as gender equality, environmental sustainability, and political freedom. Students often attribute the development gap entirely to natural factors (climate, landlocked status) without understanding the historical, political, and trade-related causes. Students sometimes present aid as an unambiguous good without evaluating criticisms: aid dependency, tied aid conditions, and the argument that trade reform would be more effective.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify that some countries are richer than others but cannot use development indicators or explain the causes of the development gap. | What is the development gap? | Not using any specific development indicators to measure the gap; Treating development as purely about money |
| **Developing** | Can use development indicators to describe global patterns of inequality, explain several causes of the development gap, and describe strategies for reducing it. | Explain two causes of the development gap between high-income and low-income countries. (4 marks) | Listing causes without explaining how they create and perpetuate inequality; Attributing the development gap to a single factor rather than recognising multiple interacting causes |
| **Secure** | Can construct detailed analytical arguments about the causes of the development gap, evaluate strategies for reducing inequality with specific evidence, and use named country case studies. | Evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies for reducing the development gap. Consider aid, trade, investment and debt relief. (9 marks) | Evaluating each strategy in isolation without comparing their relative effectiveness; Not using specific named examples and data to support evaluations |
| **Mastery** | Can critically evaluate the concept of development itself, assess the power dynamics embedded in development strategies, and connect development geography to broader debates about global justice and sustainability. | Is the concept of a 'development gap' a useful way of understanding global inequality, or does it oversimplify a more complex reality? | Either accepting the concept uncritically or dismissing it entirely without acknowledging its usefulness; Not recognising that inequality exists within countries as well as between them |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *The development gap is when some countries are rich and some are poor.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *One cause is the legacy of colonialism. Many low-income countries were colonised by European powers who extracted resources and structured colonial economies to export raw materials rather than develop manufacturing. After independence, these countries inherited economies dependent on exporting a narrow range of commodities, making them vulnerable to price fluctuations. For example, many sub-Saharan African countries still depend heavily on mining or agricultural exports. Another cause is unfair terms of trade. Low-income countries export cheap raw materials but import expensive manufactured goods. A kilogram of coffee beans exported from Ethiopia is worth far less than the processed coffee sold in UK supermarkets, so the value added in processing accrues to rich countries rather than the producing country.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Each strategy has strengths and limitations. Aid can be effective in emergencies (providing food, medicine and shelter after disasters) and in targeted development projects (building wells, training health workers), but it has been criticised for creating dependency, being tied to donor conditions, and sometimes being diverted by corruption. Between 1960 and 2020, over $4 trillion in aid was transferred to developing countries with mixed results. Trade reform may be more sustainable because it enables countries to earn their own income. Fairtrade guarantees minimum prices for producers (e.g. cocoa farmers in Ghana), but it reaches only a small proportion of producers and does not address the fundamental structural inequalities in global trade. FDI (foreign direct investment) brings capital, technology and employment, but TNCs may repatriate profits, pay low wages, and damage local environments. Nigeria has attracted massive oil FDI but the benefits have been concentrated among elites while the Niger Delta has suffered environmental devastation. Debt relief (e.g. the HIPC initiative) frees government spending from interest payments and redirects it towards health and education. Uganda used debt relief savings to make primary education free, increasing enrolment from 2.5 million to 6.5 million. However, debt relief only helps countries that were already in debt and does not address the root causes of underdevelopment. No single strategy is sufficient; the most effective approach combines multiple strategies tailored to each country's specific circumstances.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *The concept of a 'development gap' is useful as a starting point but oversimplifies in several important ways. Its usefulness lies in making visible the extreme inequality between the world's richest and poorest countries: when life expectancy ranges from 53 years (Central African Republic) to 85 years (Japan), the gap represents real differences in human wellbeing that demand explanation and response. However, the concept oversimplifies in at least four ways. First, it implies a single spectrum from 'undeveloped' to 'developed' when development is multi-dimensional: a country might have high economic growth but poor environmental sustainability, or high life expectancy but significant gender inequality. Saudi Arabia has a high GNI per capita but scores poorly on many social development measures. Second, the gap framework focuses on differences between countries while ignoring inequality within countries, which is often equally severe: India has both billionaires and hundreds of millions living in poverty. Third, the concept implies that 'development' means becoming like Western industrialised nations, ignoring alternative development paths and values. Bhutan's Gross National Happiness index explicitly rejects GDP growth as the primary goal. Fourth, the framework treats developing countries as deficient rather than examining the structural relationships (colonial history, trade rules, debt, power within international institutions) that produce and maintain inequality. The most geographically sophisticated approach retains the concept of inequality as a spatial phenomenon to be mapped and explained, but uses more nuanced frameworks that recognise multi-dimensional development, within-country inequality, alternative development models, and the structural causes of global inequality.*

### Secondary concept: Climate Change (GE-KS4-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The observed and projected changes to global climate systems, primarily driven by increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases from human activity. Encompasses the evidence base for climate change, the physical mechanisms involved, the differentiated impacts across global regions, and the range of mitigation and adaptation strategies.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can state that the world is getting warmer and that this is caused by greenhouse gases, but cannot explain the enhanced greenhouse effect mechanism or distinguish between mitigation and adaptation. | Using vague language like 'pollution' without specifying greenhouse gases; Not explaining the mechanism of the greenhouse effect |
| **Developing** | Can explain the enhanced greenhouse effect using specific terminology, cite evidence for climate change, and describe the difference between mitigation and adaptation strategies. | Confusing mitigation (reducing causes) with adaptation (managing consequences); Not giving specific, concrete examples of each strategy |
| **Secure** | Can analyse the evidence for climate change using multiple data sources, evaluate the geographically differentiated impacts, and assess management strategies at different scales with substantiated judgements. | Describing what agreements say without evaluating their actual effectiveness; Not considering the equity dimension of international climate negotiations |
| **Mastery** | Can critically evaluate the scientific, political and economic dimensions of climate change, assess the interactions between different response strategies, and construct original arguments about the geographical implications of different warming scenarios. | Presenting the 1.5 degree target as either easily achievable or completely impossible, rather than analysing the specific barriers; Not recognising that the consequences of different warming levels are geographically differentiated |

### Secondary concept: Urbanisation and Slum Development (GE-KS4-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The process by which an increasing proportion of a country's population lives in urban areas, driven by rural-urban migration and natural population growth in cities, producing both economic opportunities and social and environmental challenges, particularly in LICs and NEEs where growth is rapid and informal settlements develop.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can state that cities are growing and that some cities have slums, but cannot explain the process of urbanisation or the push-pull factors driving rural-urban migration. | Giving only one generic reason without specific detail; Not distinguishing between push and pull factors |
| **Developing** | Can explain the causes of urbanisation using the push-pull model, describe the challenges of rapid urban growth in LIC/NEE cities using a named case study, and identify some management strategies. | Describing informal settlements in entirely negative terms without acknowledging economic activity and community resilience; Not using specific data or named examples |
| **Secure** | Can analyse urbanisation challenges in contrasting contexts (HIC and LIC/NEE), evaluate improvement strategies, and explain the relationship between urbanisation, development and inequality. | Describing challenges without evaluating the effectiveness of management strategies; Not recognising that the nature and scale of urban challenges differ between HIC and LIC contexts |
| **Mastery** | Can critically evaluate urbanisation as a global process, analyse the interactions between urbanisation, development and environmental sustainability, and assess whether informal settlements represent failure or adaptation. | Treating informal settlements as either entirely positive or entirely negative rather than recognising their complexity; Not considering the economic activity and social networks within informal settlements alongside their physical challenges |

### Secondary concept: Geographical Statistical Skills (GE-KS4-C010)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The selection, application, and interpretation of numerical and statistical techniques to process geographical data, identify patterns and correlations, test hypotheses, and evaluate the reliability of data sets.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can calculate simple averages and read basic graphs, but struggles with more advanced statistical techniques and cannot interpret statistical results in geographical terms. | Making arithmetic errors in calculating the mean; Not understanding when the mean is an appropriate measure (e.g. it is distorted by outliers) |
| **Developing** | Can calculate mean, median, range and interquartile range, construct scatter graphs, and describe correlations in geographical terms. | Describing the statistical pattern without giving a geographical explanation; Not identifying and attempting to explain anomalies |
| **Secure** | Can calculate and interpret Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, test results against significance tables, and use statistical evidence to support geographical arguments. | Calculating Spearman's rank without testing the result against the critical value for significance; Stating that correlation proves causation rather than indicating a relationship |
| **Mastery** | Can select and justify appropriate statistical techniques for different types of data, critically evaluate the limitations of statistical analysis in geography, and use statistics as evidence within broader geographical arguments. | Treating statistical significance as proof rather than as evidence that supports a hypothesis; Not recognising the limitations of applying statistical techniques to small fieldwork datasets |

### Secondary concept: Transnational Corporations and Economic Globalisation (GE-KS4-C012)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

The role of transnational corporations (TNCs) in driving economic globalisation, their impacts on host countries (both positive and negative), and the relationship between FDI, economic development, and the changing geography of manufacturing and services.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify that large companies operate in multiple countries but cannot explain how TNCs affect development or why they locate in particular countries. | Only naming examples without explaining what makes them transnational; Not understanding why TNCs locate different functions in different countries |
| **Developing** | Can explain why TNCs locate in different countries and describe both positive and negative impacts on host countries using a named case study. | Describing impacts as entirely positive or entirely negative without acknowledging complexity; Not using specific named examples |
| **Secure** | Can evaluate the overall impact of TNCs on development in host countries, analyse the power dynamics between TNCs and governments, and assess whether TNC investment is a net benefit or cost. | Making a blanket judgement about TNCs without recognising that outcomes vary by company, sector and country; Not considering the role of government regulation in determining whether TNC investment is beneficial |
| **Mastery** | Can analyse globalisation critically, evaluate the power asymmetries in global production networks, and connect TNC activity to broader debates about economic justice and sustainability. | Treating TNCs as all-powerful entities that determine development outcomes regardless of government policy and other factors; Not recognising the variation between different types of TNC investment (extractive vs manufacturing vs services) |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** The development gap unit is explicitly causal — pupils must identify and evaluate multiple interacting causes of global inequality (colonialism, trade rules, geography, governance, conflict) and assess whether these causes are being addressed by current aid, trade and debt relief strategies.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- Is this a necessary cause, a sufficient cause, or a contributing factor?
- What confounding variables could explain this relationship?
- How would you design an investigation to establish causation, not just correlation?
- In this causal chain, where could an intervention have the most effect?

**Secondary lens:** Systems and System Models — TNCs operate as global economic systems linking raw material extraction, manufacturing, distribution and consumption across multiple countries; pupils must model how value is generated and distributed along these supply chains to understand why some countries benefit more than others from the same globalisation process.

## Session structure: Case Study + Secondary Data Analysis

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Case Study (main structure)
An in-depth investigation of a specific real-world example, location, or scenario. Starts with locating and describing the case in context, collects and organises relevant data, analyses patterns and processes, compares with other cases where appropriate, and reaches an evaluative conclusion.

`locate_and_describe` → `introduction` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `comparison` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Written case study report with data presentation (tables, graphs, maps), analysis of findings, and evaluative conclusion that addresses the original enquiry question.

**Teacher note:** Use the CASE STUDY template: frame the case within a broader theoretical or conceptual context. Expect pupils to select and justify appropriate data collection methods. Guide critical analysis using subject-specific frameworks and quantitative techniques where appropriate. Demand evaluative conclusions that consider the typicality of the case and the generalisability of findings.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does this case illustrate or challenge the broader theory?
- What are the strengths and weaknesses of the data collection methods used?
- To what extent can we generalise from this case study?
- How would you evaluate the significance of your findings in the wider context?

### Secondary Data Analysis
An enquiry using existing published data sets rather than first-hand collection. Pupils frame an enquiry question, select and evaluate appropriate data sources, process and present data using statistical or graphical methods, analyse patterns and anomalies, evaluate reliability, and present findings.

`question_framing` → `data_selection` → `processing` → `analysis` → `evaluation` → `presentation`

**Assessment:** Data analysis report including processed data presented in appropriate formats, statistical analysis where relevant, interpretation of findings, and evaluation of data reliability and limitations.

**Teacher note:** Use the SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS template: expect pupils to independently select, evaluate, and process secondary data using statistical or analytical techniques. Demand critical assessment of data quality, collection methodology, potential biases, and the validity of conclusions drawn from secondary analysis. Guide formal presentation of findings with appropriate acknowledgement of uncertainty.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How would you evaluate the reliability and validity of this secondary dataset?
- What analytical techniques are most appropriate for this data, and why?
- What biases or limitations in the original data collection might affect your conclusions?
- How would you present your findings with appropriate acknowledgement of uncertainty?

## Why this study matters

The Development Gap and Globalisation extends KS3 work on Nigeria and development inequality to GCSE-level analysis of global economic systems. Pupils must understand why the development gap exists, how globalisation is reshaping it, and evaluate the roles of TNCs, aid, fair trade and economic restructuring. A named LIC/NEE case study (e.g. Nigeria, India, China) is required to demonstrate how economic development creates both opportunities and challenges.

## Sequencing

**Follows:** Development and Global Inequality: Nigeria

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Treating development as a linear journey from 'poor' to 'rich' rather than a complex process shaped by historical, political and geographical factors
2. Presenting TNCs as simply exploitative or simply beneficial — demand evaluation of both costs and benefits
3. Using outdated terminology (Third World, developing country) rather than current vocabulary (LIC, NEE, HIC)

## Sensitive content

- Development inequality can be distressing — frame with analysis and agency, not pity
- Avoid deficit framing of LICs — show economic dynamism, innovation and cultural richness alongside challenges
- Sweatshop labour and child labour are part of this study — handle factually and analytically

---

## Success criteria

**Pupils can:**
- Use and evaluate multiple development indicators (GDP, GNI, HDI)
- Explain the causes of the development gap (historical, geographical, political)
- Analyse the costs and benefits of TNCs for a named LIC/NEE country
- Evaluate strategies for reducing the development gap (aid, fair trade, debt relief)

## Geographical skills (KS4)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Using maps, atlases and globes** — Locating and identifying places in the United Kingdom and wider world using world maps, atlases and globes as reference tools, understanding that these are representations of the real world at reduced scale.
- **Using compass directions and locational language** — Applying the four cardinal compass directions (North, South, East, West) and everyday directional language such as near, far, left and right to describe the location of features and routes on maps and in the environment.
- **Using aerial photographs and making simple maps** — Interpreting aerial photographs and plan-perspective images to recognise landmarks and physical and human features, and translating these observations into a simple hand-drawn map with a basic symbol key.
- **Simple fieldwork and observational skills** — Going out into the school grounds and immediate surrounding environment to observe, describe and record human and physical geographical features at first hand, practising the habits of direct geographical enquiry.
- **Using maps, atlases, globes and digital mapping** — Extending atlas and map use to locate countries and describe the features studied across the curriculum, and beginning to use digital and computer mapping tools — including online satellite maps — to access geographical information in a range of formats.
- **Eight-point compass and Ordnance Survey map skills** — Applying the eight compass points, four-figure and six-figure grid references, and the symbols and conventions of Ordnance Survey maps to build knowledge of the UK and the wider world, and to navigate and locate features on topographic maps.
