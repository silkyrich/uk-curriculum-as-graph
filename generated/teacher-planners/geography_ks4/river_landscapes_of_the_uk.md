## Enquiry questions

1. How do rivers shape the UK landscape, and how should we manage flood risk?

---

## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: River Landscapes and Processes (GE-KS4-C003)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The physical processes of erosion (hydraulic action, abrasion, attrition, solution), transportation (traction, saltation, suspension, solution), and deposition that shape river channels and valleys at different stages of a river's long profile, producing characteristic landforms in upper, middle, and lower course environments.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach using the long profile of a river as the organising framework: upper course (steep gradient, high energy, dominantly erosive — interlocking spurs, V-shaped valleys, rapids, waterfalls and gorges), middle course (reduced gradient, balanced erosion and deposition — meanders begin to develop), and lower course (gentle gradient, low energy, dominantly depositional — meanders, oxbow lakes, flood plains, levees, estuaries, deltas). For exam questions asking students to 'explain the formation of' a named landform, teach a structured approach: identify the process, describe the mechanism, explain the resulting landform shape. GCSE 6-mark questions on landform formation require sequential explanation with accurate geographical terminology. Common question formats: 'explain how a waterfall is formed' (4-6 marks); 'assess the effectiveness of river flood management strategies' (8 marks).

**Key vocabulary:** hydraulic action, abrasion, attrition, solution, traction, saltation, suspension, deposition, long profile, gradient, discharge, interlocking spur, waterfall, gorge, meander, oxbow lake, floodplain, levee, estuary, delta, bankfull discharge

**Common misconceptions:** Students frequently confuse corrasion (abrasion) with corrosion (chemical solution), using terms interchangeably. Students often describe river processes but fail to explain the mechanism — hydraulic action is not just 'the power of water' but the specific process of air pockets collapsing in cracks. Students sometimes apply upper-course processes to lower-course contexts, not recognising that the dominant process changes along the river's length as gradient and velocity change.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify that rivers shape the land and that different features exist at different points along a river, but cannot explain the processes that create specific landforms. | Name two landforms found along a river. | Naming landforms without knowing where they occur along the river or how they form; Confusing erosional and depositional landforms |
| **Developing** | Can describe the processes of erosion, transportation and deposition, explain how specific landforms are created, and locate them along the river's long profile. | Explain how a waterfall is formed and how it retreats to form a gorge. (4 marks) | Describing the appearance of a waterfall without explaining the formation process step by step; Not explaining how the differential erosion of hard and soft rock creates the overhang |
| **Secure** | Can construct detailed explanations of landform formation using correct process terminology, explain how the river system changes along its course, and evaluate management strategies. | Explain how meanders and oxbow lakes form and why they are found in the middle and lower course of a river. (6 marks) | Describing what meanders look like without explaining the erosion and deposition processes that form them; Not explaining the connection between velocity, erosion on the outside, and deposition on the inside of the bend |
| **Mastery** | Can apply the systems approach to river landscapes, analyse how human intervention alters natural processes, and evaluate the long-term sustainability of different river management strategies. | Evaluate the view that hard engineering solutions to river flooding create more problems than they solve. | Presenting hard and soft engineering as simple alternatives without recognising that integrated approaches are usually most effective; Not applying the systems concept to explain why interventions at one point affect processes elsewhere |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Waterfall and meander.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *A waterfall forms where a river flows over a band of hard rock underlain by softer rock. The softer rock is eroded more quickly by hydraulic action and abrasion, creating an overhang of hard rock. The force of the water falling over the edge creates a plunge pool at the base, which is deepened by abrasion from rocks swirling in the turbulent water. Over time, the overhang becomes unsupported and collapses. This process repeats, causing the waterfall to gradually retreat upstream, leaving behind a steep-sided gorge. An example is High Force waterfall on the River Tees, where the Whin Sill (a band of resistant dolerite rock) overlies softer limestone and shale.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Meanders develop in the middle and lower course because the river has lower gradient and velocity is concentrated on the outside of bends rather than cutting downward. On the outside of a bend, the water flows faster and erosion (hydraulic action and abrasion) undercuts the bank, forming a river cliff. On the inside of the bend, water flows more slowly, losing energy and depositing material to form a slip-off slope (point bar). Over time, the meander becomes more pronounced as the outer bank is eroded and the inner bank builds up, and the neck of the meander narrows. During a flood, the river may break through the narrow neck, taking the shortest route and leaving the old meander loop cut off as an oxbow lake. The oxbow lake gradually silts up and may eventually become a meander scar on the floodplain. Meanders are characteristic of the middle and lower course because this is where the river has sufficient energy for lateral (sideways) erosion but a low enough gradient that it follows a sinuous path rather than cutting straight downward.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Hard engineering solutions (dams, embankments, flood walls, channelisation) are effective at protecting specific areas from flooding but frequently transfer the problem elsewhere or create unintended consequences. Embankments (levees) along the Mississippi River, for example, confine the river within a narrower channel, increasing velocity and flood risk downstream. Channelisation (straightening and deepening the river) increases velocity and erosion in the straightened section while reducing the river's natural capacity to store floodwater on its floodplain. Dams disrupt sediment transport, causing erosion downstream of the dam (the river, deprived of its sediment load, erodes its own bed and banks to compensate) and deposition upstream (reducing the dam's capacity over time). Hard engineering is also expensive to maintain: the Environment Agency estimates that maintaining England's flood defences costs over 1 billion per year. Soft engineering alternatives (floodplain restoration, afforestation, sustainable drainage systems) work with natural processes rather than against them. Restoring floodplains gives the river space to flood naturally, reducing peak discharge downstream. However, soft engineering requires large land areas and may conflict with agricultural and development interests. The most sustainable approach combines targeted hard engineering in high-value urban areas with soft engineering in upstream catchments to reduce flood risk at source. The key insight from a systems perspective is that rivers are dynamic systems: interventions at one point inevitably affect processes elsewhere, and sustainable management must account for the whole catchment rather than protecting individual locations in isolation.*

### Secondary concept: Geographical Fieldwork Enquiry (GE-KS4-C008)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

| **Secure** | Can construct and interpret a range of map types (choropleth, isoline, proportional), use maps to answer geographical questions, and evaluate the advantages and limitations of different cartographic techniques. | Describing each map type without comparing their relative strengths; Not recognising that choropleth maps can be misleading because they imply uniform distribution within areas |
| **Mastery** | Can critically evaluate how cartographic choices shape the viewer's understanding, use GIS as an analytical tool, and recognise how maps can both reveal and conceal geographical realities. | Treating maps as objective representations of reality rather than as constructed artefacts that involve choices; Not considering how the same data could be mapped differently to convey different messages |

## Thinking lens: Systems and System Models (primary)

**Key question:** What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?

**Why this lens fits:** The river drainage basin is a physical system — precipitation, infiltration, run-off, erosion, transportation and deposition are interdependent processes forming a cascade; pupils must model how changes upstream or in land use propagate through the whole system to affect flood risk downstream.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- What assumptions does this model make, and how do they limit its predictions?
- Are there tipping points where small changes produce large systemic effects?
- How would you choose between two competing models of this system?
- Can this phenomenon be explained by looking at parts alone, or does it require a systems perspective?

**Secondary lens:** Cause and Effect — Examining flood management strategies requires tracing how both physical causes (high rainfall, impermeable rock) and human causes (urbanisation, deforestation) combine to increase flood risk, and evaluating whether hard or soft engineering responses address root causes or merely symptoms.

## Session structure: Case Study + Fieldwork

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Case Study (main structure)
An in-depth investigation of a specific real-world example, location, or scenario. Starts with locating and describing the case in context, collects and organises relevant data, analyses patterns and processes, compares with other cases where appropriate, and reaches an evaluative conclusion.

`locate_and_describe` → `introduction` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `comparison` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Written case study report with data presentation (tables, graphs, maps), analysis of findings, and evaluative conclusion that addresses the original enquiry question.

**Teacher note:** Use the CASE STUDY template: frame the case within a broader theoretical or conceptual context. Expect pupils to select and justify appropriate data collection methods. Guide critical analysis using subject-specific frameworks and quantitative techniques where appropriate. Demand evaluative conclusions that consider the typicality of the case and the generalisability of findings.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does this case illustrate or challenge the broader theory?
- What are the strengths and weaknesses of the data collection methods used?
- To what extent can we generalise from this case study?
- How would you evaluate the significance of your findings in the wider context?

### Fieldwork
Learning through direct observation and data collection in the field (or simulated field environment). Includes preparation and planning, systematic data collection using fieldwork techniques, data processing and presentation, analysis of findings, and a conclusion that addresses the enquiry question.

`preparation` → `field_data_collection` → `processing` → `analysis` → `conclusion`

**Assessment:** Fieldwork report including methodology, data presentation using appropriate techniques (maps, graphs, tables, photographs), analysis of patterns, and conclusion with evaluation of data reliability.

**Teacher note:** Use the FIELDWORK template: expect pupils to design a fieldwork methodology with justified sampling, appropriate quantitative and qualitative techniques, and risk assessment. Demand rigorous data processing including statistical analysis where appropriate. Guide critical evaluation of methodology, data quality, and conclusions, with reference to how fieldwork evidence supports or challenges geographical or scientific theory.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does your sampling strategy ensure your data is representative?
- What statistical techniques will you use to analyse your field data?
- How do your fieldwork conclusions relate to the broader geographical or scientific theory?
- What methodological improvements would strengthen your investigation?

## Why this study matters

River landscapes is one of two compulsory UK physical landscape options at GCSE (alongside coastal landscapes). It develops process-based understanding of how rivers shape the landscape through erosion, transportation and deposition, creating distinctive landforms at different points along the river's long profile. The management dimension (hard vs soft engineering) introduces cost-benefit analysis and the concept of sustainable flood management.

---

## Sequencing

**Follows:** Resource Management: UK Water

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Teaching river landforms as isolated features rather than explaining the PROCESSES that create them
2. Describing hard and soft engineering without evaluating their effectiveness, cost, and environmental impact
3. Neglecting the human geography dimension — why do people live on floodplains despite the risk?

## Sensitive content

- UK flooding events are common and may have directly affected pupils — handle with sensitivity
- Flood management decisions involve winners and losers — acknowledge that protecting one area can increase risk elsewhere

---

## Success criteria

**Pupils can:**
- Explain how erosion, transportation and deposition create distinctive river landforms
- Use OS maps and cross-sections to describe and explain river valley features
- Analyse causes and consequences of a named UK flood event
- Evaluate the effectiveness of hard and soft engineering flood management strategies

---

## Geographical skills (KS4)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Using maps, atlases and globes** — Locating and identifying places in the United Kingdom and wider world using world maps, atlases and globes as reference tools, understanding that these are representations of the real world at reduced scale.
- **Using compass directions and locational language** — Applying the four cardinal compass directions (North, South, East, West) and everyday directional language such as near, far, left and right to describe the location of features and routes on maps and in the environment.
- **Using aerial photographs and making simple maps** — Interpreting aerial photographs and plan-perspective images to recognise landmarks and physical and human features, and translating these observations into a simple hand-drawn map with a basic symbol key.
- **Simple fieldwork and observational skills** — Going out into the school grounds and immediate surrounding environment to observe, describe and record human and physical geographical features at first hand, practising the habits of direct geographical enquiry.
- **Using maps, atlases, globes and digital mapping** — Extending atlas and map use to locate countries and describe the features studied across the curriculum, and beginning to use digital and computer mapping tools — including online satellite maps — to access geographical information in a range of formats.
- **Eight-point compass and Ordnance Survey map skills** — Applying the eight compass points, four-figure and six-figure grid references, and the symbols and conventions of Ordnance Survey maps to build knowledge of the UK and the wider world, and to navigate and locate features on topographic maps.
