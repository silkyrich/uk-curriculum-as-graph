## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Tectonic Hazards (GE-KS4-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The study of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions as hazards arising from processes at tectonic plate boundaries. Encompasses the physical processes of plate movement and magma activity, the global distribution of hazard zones, the differential impacts of tectonic events on communities with different levels of economic development, and the effectiveness of prediction, preparedness, and response strategies.

**Teaching guidance:** Structure teaching using the hazard management cycle: prevention (limited for tectonic hazards), preparation (monitoring, prediction, emergency planning, earthquake-resistant buildings), response (immediate rescue, search and relief), and recovery (rebuilding, long-term reconstruction). The key analytical skill at GCSE is explaining differential impacts: why does the same magnitude earthquake kill more people in a low-income country than in a high-income country? Students must explain the role of building quality, emergency services, infrastructure, wealth, government capacity, and population density. Exam questions frequently ask for 'explain why effects differ' or 'assess the effectiveness of responses'. Case study questions require specific factual detail: named countries, dates, death tolls, economic costs, and specific management strategies.

**Key vocabulary:** tectonic plate, plate boundary, constructive boundary, destructive boundary, conservative boundary, subduction, seismometer, Richter scale, epicentre, focus, magma, lava, pyroclastic flow, primary effect, secondary effect, immediate response, long-term response

**Common misconceptions:** Students frequently confuse the magnitude of a tectonic event with its impact, not recognising that a smaller earthquake in a vulnerable location can kill more people than a larger one in a prepared country. Students often describe the effects of earthquakes without explaining the mechanism by which the shaking caused those effects (e.g. why liquefaction occurs, why aftershocks can cause as much damage as the primary event). Students sometimes apply LIC/HIC generalisations too rigidly, overlooking that some high-income regions have high vulnerability due to location (e.g. Japan) and some LIC communities have developed effective local coping strategies.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify that earthquakes and volcanoes are natural hazards and that they occur at plate boundaries, but cannot explain the processes at different boundary types or the factors affecting impact. | Name the three types of plate boundary and give one hazard associated with each. | Confusing the three types of plate boundary; Not explaining why different hazards occur at different boundary types |
| **Developing** | Can explain the processes at each plate boundary type, describe the effects of a tectonic event using a named example, and identify factors that affect the severity of impacts. | Explain why the Haiti earthquake (2010, magnitude 7.0) caused more deaths than the Japan earthquake (2011, magnitude 9.0). (4 marks) | Attributing the difference in deaths solely to the magnitude of the earthquake; Not explaining the specific mechanisms by which development level affects vulnerability |
| **Secure** | Can construct detailed analytical responses comparing tectonic events in contrasting development contexts, evaluating the effectiveness of management strategies using specific evidence. | Assess the effectiveness of prediction, protection and preparation as strategies for managing tectonic hazards. Use named examples. (9 marks) | Describing management strategies without evaluating their effectiveness; Not recognising that the effectiveness of strategies depends on the development context |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate the concept of hazard vulnerability critically, analyse the interaction between physical processes and human factors in determining outcomes, and assess whether tectonic hazards are becoming more or less dangerous over time. | Are tectonic hazards becoming more dangerous? Consider changes in both physical risk and human vulnerability. | Confusing changes in physical hazard frequency with changes in human vulnerability; Not recognising that development level is the key variable determining whether tectonic events become disasters |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Constructive — volcanoes. Destructive — earthquakes. Conservative — earthquakes.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Haiti suffered approximately 230,000 deaths compared to about 18,000 in Japan despite the lower magnitude because Haiti is a low-income country with poor building quality — many buildings were not earthquake-resistant and collapsed. Japan is a high-income country with strict building codes, earthquake-resistant structures, and well-practised evacuation procedures. Haiti had limited emergency services and health infrastructure to respond to the disaster, while Japan had a comprehensive early warning system and well-funded response capacity.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Prediction of tectonic hazards remains limited: earthquakes cannot currently be predicted with useful accuracy (specific location, time and magnitude), though seismic monitoring can identify areas of high risk. Volcanic eruptions are more predictable through monitoring of ground deformation, gas emissions and seismic activity — the successful evacuation of 75,000 people before the Mount Pinatubo eruption (Philippines, 1991) demonstrates the value of monitoring. Protection through engineering is highly effective in high-income countries: Japan's earthquake-resistant buildings, automatic gas shutoffs and flexible infrastructure saved thousands of lives in the 2011 earthquake. However, earthquake-resistant construction is expensive and unaffordable for many LIC communities. The Haitian government lacked both the regulatory framework and the resources to enforce building codes before the 2010 earthquake. Preparation through education, drills and emergency planning is the most universally applicable strategy: Japan's regular earthquake drills and tsunami warning systems were credited with saving many lives in 2011. However, preparation requires sustained investment and institutional capacity that not all countries possess. The most effective approach combines all three strategies, but the level of protection achievable depends heavily on economic development, government capacity and infrastructure investment.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *The frequency and magnitude of tectonic events have not changed significantly — these are driven by geological processes operating over millions of years. However, the danger tectonic hazards pose to human populations is changing due to shifts in vulnerability. On one hand, vulnerability is increasing in some areas: rapid urbanisation is concentrating millions of people in earthquake-prone cities (Istanbul, Tehran, Kathmandu, Mexico City), often in poorly constructed buildings. Population growth in hazard zones means that even moderate earthquakes can now affect larger numbers of people than historically. On the other hand, technology and governance have reduced vulnerability in wealthy nations: building codes, early warning systems, monitoring technology and emergency response capacity have dramatically reduced death tolls in countries like Japan and Chile. The critical factor is development: wealthy countries are becoming safer while poor countries remain highly vulnerable or become more so as urbanisation concentrates populations in hazard zones without corresponding improvements in infrastructure. Climate change adds complexity: while it does not directly affect tectonic activity, it may increase the risk of secondary hazards (e.g. landslides triggered by increased rainfall on volcanically unstable slopes). The most important conclusion is that tectonic hazard risk is not primarily a geological problem but a development problem: the same physical event produces radically different outcomes depending on the social, economic and political context in which it occurs.*

### Secondary concept: Climate Change (GE-KS4-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The observed and projected changes to global climate systems, primarily driven by increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases from human activity. Encompasses the evidence base for climate change, the physical mechanisms involved, the differentiated impacts across global regions, and the range of mitigation and adaptation strategies.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can state that the world is getting warmer and that this is caused by greenhouse gases, but cannot explain the enhanced greenhouse effect mechanism or distinguish between mitigation and adaptation. | Using vague language like 'pollution' without specifying greenhouse gases; Not explaining the mechanism of the greenhouse effect |
| **Developing** | Can explain the enhanced greenhouse effect using specific terminology, cite evidence for climate change, and describe the difference between mitigation and adaptation strategies. | Confusing mitigation (reducing causes) with adaptation (managing consequences); Not giving specific, concrete examples of each strategy |
| **Secure** | Can analyse the evidence for climate change using multiple data sources, evaluate the geographically differentiated impacts, and assess management strategies at different scales with substantiated judgements. | Describing what agreements say without evaluating their actual effectiveness; Not considering the equity dimension of international climate negotiations |
| **Mastery** | Can critically evaluate the scientific, political and economic dimensions of climate change, assess the interactions between different response strategies, and construct original arguments about the geographical implications of different warming scenarios. | Presenting the 1.5 degree target as either easily achievable or completely impossible, rather than analysing the specific barriers; Not recognising that the consequences of different warming levels are geographically differentiated |

### Secondary concept: The Development Gap (GE-KS4-C006)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The disparity in wealth, economic opportunity, health outcomes, and living standards between the world's richest and poorest countries, measured through a range of development indicators, and explained by the interaction of physical, historical, economic, and political factors.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify that some countries are richer than others but cannot use development indicators or explain the causes of the development gap. | Not using any specific development indicators to measure the gap; Treating development as purely about money |
| **Developing** | Can use development indicators to describe global patterns of inequality, explain several causes of the development gap, and describe strategies for reducing it. | Listing causes without explaining how they create and perpetuate inequality; Attributing the development gap to a single factor rather than recognising multiple interacting causes |
| **Secure** | Can construct detailed analytical arguments about the causes of the development gap, evaluate strategies for reducing inequality with specific evidence, and use named country case studies. | Evaluating each strategy in isolation without comparing their relative effectiveness; Not using specific named examples and data to support evaluations |
| **Mastery** | Can critically evaluate the concept of development itself, assess the power dynamics embedded in development strategies, and connect development geography to broader debates about global justice and sustainability. | Either accepting the concept uncritically or dismissing it entirely without acknowledging its usefulness; Not recognising that inequality exists within countries as well as between them |

### Secondary concept: Cartographic and Map Skills (GE-KS4-C009)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

The ability to read, interpret, construct, and critically evaluate a range of map types including OS maps, atlas maps, choropleth maps, dot maps, isoline maps, flow-line maps, and GIS-based digital maps, to answer geographical questions about location, distribution, pattern, and spatial relationship.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can use a simple map to identify features and give basic directions, but struggles with grid references, contour interpretation and scale calculations. | Reversing eastings and northings in grid references; Not understanding what contour lines represent |
| **Developing** | Can use four and six-figure grid references accurately, interpret basic contour patterns to describe relief, use scale to measure distances, and identify land use patterns from map symbols. | Describing what is on the map without interpreting what it means geographically (e.g. describing contour lines without interpreting relief); Not using specific heights from contour lines |
| **Secure** | Can construct and interpret a range of map types (choropleth, isoline, proportional), use maps to answer geographical questions, and evaluate the advantages and limitations of different cartographic techniques. | Describing each map type without comparing their relative strengths; Not recognising that choropleth maps can be misleading because they imply uniform distribution within areas |
| **Mastery** | Can critically evaluate how cartographic choices shape the viewer's understanding, use GIS as an analytical tool, and recognise how maps can both reveal and conceal geographical realities. | Treating maps as objective representations of reality rather than as constructed artefacts that involve choices; Not considering how the same data could be mapped differently to convey different messages |

### Secondary concept: Geographical Statistical Skills (GE-KS4-C010)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The selection, application, and interpretation of numerical and statistical techniques to process geographical data, identify patterns and correlations, test hypotheses, and evaluate the reliability of data sets.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can calculate simple averages and read basic graphs, but struggles with more advanced statistical techniques and cannot interpret statistical results in geographical terms. | Making arithmetic errors in calculating the mean; Not understanding when the mean is an appropriate measure (e.g. it is distorted by outliers) |
| **Developing** | Can calculate mean, median, range and interquartile range, construct scatter graphs, and describe correlations in geographical terms. | Describing the statistical pattern without giving a geographical explanation; Not identifying and attempting to explain anomalies |
| **Secure** | Can calculate and interpret Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, test results against significance tables, and use statistical evidence to support geographical arguments. | Calculating Spearman's rank without testing the result against the critical value for significance; Stating that correlation proves causation rather than indicating a relationship |
| **Mastery** | Can select and justify appropriate statistical techniques for different types of data, critically evaluate the limitations of statistical analysis in geography, and use statistics as evidence within broader geographical arguments. | Treating statistical significance as proof rather than as evidence that supports a hypothesis; Not recognising the limitations of applying statistical techniques to small fieldwork datasets |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Tectonic hazards analysis requires pupils to trace the causal chain from plate boundary type through earthquake or eruption mechanism to primary and secondary impacts, then evaluate whether management strategies can interrupt the chain — cause-and-effect reasoning is the explicit cognitive demand.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- Is this a necessary cause, a sufficient cause, or a contributing factor?
- What confounding variables could explain this relationship?
- How would you design an investigation to establish causation, not just correlation?
- In this causal chain, where could an intervention have the most effect?

**Secondary lens:** Systems and System Models — Comparing management strategies in contrasting global contexts requires pupils to model how socioeconomic systems interact with physical hazard risk — why the same magnitude earthquake kills thousands in one country and hundreds in another depends on system-level factors like building codes, emergency response and land use.

## Session structure: Case Study + Comparison Study

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Case Study (main structure)
An in-depth investigation of a specific real-world example, location, or scenario. Starts with locating and describing the case in context, collects and organises relevant data, analyses patterns and processes, compares with other cases where appropriate, and reaches an evaluative conclusion.

`locate_and_describe` → `introduction` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `comparison` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Written case study report with data presentation (tables, graphs, maps), analysis of findings, and evaluative conclusion that addresses the original enquiry question.

**Teacher note:** Use the CASE STUDY template: frame the case within a broader theoretical or conceptual context. Expect pupils to select and justify appropriate data collection methods. Guide critical analysis using subject-specific frameworks and quantitative techniques where appropriate. Demand evaluative conclusions that consider the typicality of the case and the generalisability of findings.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does this case illustrate or challenge the broader theory?
- What are the strengths and weaknesses of the data collection methods used?
- To what extent can we generalise from this case study?
- How would you evaluate the significance of your findings in the wider context?

### Comparison Study
A structured comparison of two or more examples, places, periods, or perspectives. Introduces each example with sufficient context, applies a systematic comparison framework, analyses similarities and differences with supporting evidence, and reaches an evaluative conclusion about the significance of those differences.

`introduce_examples` → `systematic_comparison` → `analysis` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Comparative analysis using a structured framework (table, Venn diagram, or essay), demonstrating understanding of both examples and reaching a substantiated evaluative conclusion.

**Teacher note:** Use the COMPARISON STUDY template: frame the comparison within a theoretical or conceptual framework. Expect independent identification of appropriate criteria and rigorous analysis using subject-specific terminology. Demand an evaluative conclusion that assesses the extent of similarity or difference and its significance, considering limitations of the comparative method itself.

**KS4 question stems:**
- What theoretical framework underpins your choice of comparison criteria?
- To what extent do the similarities outweigh the differences, and what does this suggest?
- What are the limitations of comparing these two cases?
- How would you construct a sustained evaluative argument from this comparison?

## Contrasting localities

### Haiti vs Japan: Development and Disaster
The Haiti-Japan pairing is the most widely used tectonic hazard contrast in English secondary schools because the two events occurred within 14 months of each other, enabling clean comparison while exposing the critical role of development and governance in disaster outcomes. The contrast prevents simplistic narratives by requiring analysis of why wealth alone does not guarantee safety (Fukushima).

**Compare through:** development level, governance quality, preparedness infrastructure, casualty toll relative to magnitude, cascading effects, international response
**Stimulus questions:**
- Japan's earthquake was 100x more powerful than Haiti's. Why did Haiti lose 10x more people?
- Does money make you safe from earthquakes?
- What does the Fukushima meltdown tell us about the limits of preparedness?
- If you could spend $1 billion on earthquake preparedness in one country, which would you choose and why?

## Why this study matters

Tectonic hazards build directly on KS3 study of plate tectonics (Haiti/Japan) but demand deeper understanding of processes (why plates move, different boundary types) and more sophisticated analysis of management strategies. GCSE requires named case studies of both HIC and LIC/NEE earthquakes and volcanoes, enabling comparative analysis of how development level mediates hazard impact. The L'Aquila 2009 and Eyjafjallajokull 2010 are widely used exam board exemplars.

## Sequencing

**Follows:** Haiti 2010 Earthquake

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Describing plate boundary types without explaining WHY plates move (convection currents, ridge push, slab pull)
2. Comparing HIC and LIC earthquake impacts without analysing the specific factors (governance, infrastructure, corruption) that create vulnerability
3. Treating volcanoes and earthquakes as identical hazards when their management strategies differ fundamentally

## Sensitive content

- Recent earthquake events may have affected pupils or their families — establish sensitivity before teaching
- Avoid sensationalising death tolls — analyse them as data points that reveal vulnerability patterns

---

## Success criteria

**Pupils can:**
- Explain why tectonic hazards occur at plate boundaries using process knowledge
- Compare impacts and responses in HIC and LIC/NEE named case studies
- Evaluate the effectiveness of monitoring, prediction and protection strategies
- Analyse why some communities are more vulnerable than others

## Geographical skills (KS4)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Using maps, atlases and globes** — Locating and identifying places in the United Kingdom and wider world using world maps, atlases and globes as reference tools, understanding that these are representations of the real world at reduced scale.
- **Using compass directions and locational language** — Applying the four cardinal compass directions (North, South, East, West) and everyday directional language such as near, far, left and right to describe the location of features and routes on maps and in the environment.
- **Using aerial photographs and making simple maps** — Interpreting aerial photographs and plan-perspective images to recognise landmarks and physical and human features, and translating these observations into a simple hand-drawn map with a basic symbol key.
- **Simple fieldwork and observational skills** — Going out into the school grounds and immediate surrounding environment to observe, describe and record human and physical geographical features at first hand, practising the habits of direct geographical enquiry.
- **Using maps, atlases, globes and digital mapping** — Extending atlas and map use to locate countries and describe the features studied across the curriculum, and beginning to use digital and computer mapping tools — including online satellite maps — to access geographical information in a range of formats.
- **Eight-point compass and Ordnance Survey map skills** — Applying the eight compass points, four-figure and six-figure grid references, and the symbols and conventions of Ordnance Survey maps to build knowledge of the UK and the wider world, and to navigate and locate features on topographic maps.
