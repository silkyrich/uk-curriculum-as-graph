## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Coastal Processes and Management (GE-KS4-C004)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The physical processes of wave action, longshore drift, erosion, transportation, and deposition that shape coastlines, producing distinctive landforms in areas of hard and soft rock geology, and the strategies used to manage coastal erosion, flooding, and change.

**Teaching guidance:** Distinguish between erosional coasts (high-energy wave environments, resistant rock — headlands, bays, caves, arches, stacks, stumps) and depositional coasts (low-energy or sheltered environments — beaches, spits, bars, tombolos). Longshore drift is the unifying process that transports sediment along the coast and must be understood for all depositional features. For coastal management, teach the spectrum from hard engineering (sea walls, groynes, rock armour, offshore breakwaters) to soft engineering (beach nourishment, dune regeneration) to managed retreat (allowing erosion to proceed, compensating landowners). GCSE evaluation questions on coastal management require students to assess strategies against multiple criteria: cost, effectiveness, environmental impact, and fairness to different stakeholder groups. The concept of sediment budget helps students understand how management at one location can increase erosion elsewhere (groyne starvation).

**Key vocabulary:** wave, swash, backwash, longshore drift, fetch, hydraulic action, abrasion, attrition, solution, undercutting, headland, bay, cave, arch, stack, beach, spit, bar, sea wall, groyne, rock armour, managed retreat, beach nourishment

**Common misconceptions:** Students frequently describe longshore drift as waves moving along the coast, not understanding that it is sediment (not water) that is transported along the shore by the combination of swash angle and backwash direction. Students often list coastal management strategies without evaluating them, or assess only one strategy rather than comparing alternatives. Students sometimes assume that hard engineering is always more effective than soft engineering, without considering the longer-term costs and the problem of coastal sediment starvation caused by groynes.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify that the sea shapes the coast and that different features exist (cliffs, beaches) but cannot explain the processes of wave action or longshore drift. | What causes cliffs to erode? | Using vague language ('the sea crashes') without naming specific erosion processes; Not distinguishing between different types of erosion |
| **Developing** | Can name and explain the four types of erosion, describe longshore drift, and explain how erosional and depositional landforms are created with supporting detail. | Explain how headlands and bays form along a coastline with alternating bands of hard and soft rock. (4 marks) | Explaining bay formation without explaining why headlands remain; Not mentioning wave refraction and its role in concentrating energy on headlands |
| **Secure** | Can explain the full sequence of erosional landform development (headlands, caves, arches, stacks, stumps), evaluate coastal management strategies against multiple criteria, and use named examples. | Compare the advantages and disadvantages of hard and soft engineering approaches to coastal management. Use named examples. (9 marks) | Listing advantages and disadvantages without making a judgement about which approach is most appropriate in which context; Not recognising that coastal management at one location affects erosion at neighbouring locations |
| **Mastery** | Can apply coastal systems thinking to evaluate management decisions, analyse the interaction between physical processes and human values in coastal management debates, and assess how climate change is altering coastal risk. | Should the UK continue to protect all of its coastline from erosion, or should some areas be allowed to erode? Evaluate the geographical, economic and ethical arguments. | Treating the question as purely technical rather than recognising its ethical and political dimensions; Not connecting the management debate to the physical reality of coastal systems and sediment cells |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Cliffs erode because the sea crashes against them and wears them away over time.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *When a coastline has alternating bands of hard and soft rock at right angles to the coast, the sea erodes the softer rock more quickly through hydraulic action, abrasion and solution. This creates inlets called bays where the soft rock has been eroded. The harder rock resists erosion and remains jutting out into the sea as headlands. Over time, the headlands become increasingly exposed to wave attack because wave energy is concentrated on the headlands through wave refraction (waves bend towards the headlands as they approach the coast). Meanwhile, the bays are sheltered and wave energy is reduced, allowing deposition of sand and the formation of beaches.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Hard engineering uses man-made structures to resist erosion. Sea walls (e.g. at Scarborough) reflect wave energy and protect the coast behind them, but they are expensive (up to 6,000 per metre), require constant maintenance, and can increase erosion at their ends where unprotected coastline is exposed. Groynes (e.g. at Bournemouth) trap sediment moving along the coast through longshore drift, building up beaches that absorb wave energy. However, by trapping sediment they cause 'terminal groyne syndrome' — beaches further down-drift are starved of sediment and erode faster. Rock armour is cheaper and effective at absorbing wave energy but is visually intrusive and does not address the underlying erosion process. Soft engineering works with natural processes. Beach nourishment (adding sand to beaches, as at Pevensey Bay) increases the beach's capacity to absorb wave energy and is relatively natural-looking, but must be repeated regularly as the imported material is gradually removed by longshore drift. Managed retreat (allowing the sea to erode inland, as at Medmerry in Sussex) is the cheapest long-term option and creates new wildlife habitats, but requires compensating landowners and accepting the loss of land, which is politically difficult. The most effective approach depends on context: high-value urban areas justify expensive hard engineering, while rural coastlines may be better served by managed retreat. The critical analytical point is that any intervention at one point affects sediment supply and erosion rates elsewhere, so management must consider the whole sediment cell, not just the defended section.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *The question of whether to defend all coastline is ultimately a question about how society allocates limited resources and how it values different places and communities. The geographical argument for selective defence is compelling: the UK coastline is approximately 19,500 miles long, and defending all of it is physically impossible and economically irrational. The Shoreline Management Plan process divides the coast into sediment cells and assigns each section a policy: hold the line (defend), advance the line (build seaward), managed realignment (allow controlled erosion) or no active intervention. This approach recognises that coastal processes operate as systems and that defending one section often increases erosion elsewhere. The economic argument supports prioritising defence of high-value areas: defending central London against flooding is clearly justified by the economic assets at risk, while defending remote rural coastline with few properties may not be cost-effective. However, the ethical argument is more complex: communities in areas designated for managed retreat (like Happisburgh in Norfolk, where homes have fallen into the sea) feel their homes and livelihoods are being sacrificed. The question of who decides, and on what basis, raises issues of democratic participation and justice. Climate change intensifies the dilemma: rising sea levels and increasing storm frequency will make coastal defence more expensive everywhere, requiring ever harder choices about priorities. The most geographically informed approach accepts that some coastal erosion is natural and unavoidable, but insists that decisions about which areas to defend must be made transparently, with fair compensation for those affected and genuine community participation in the decision-making process.*

### Secondary concept: River Landscapes and Processes (GE-KS4-C003)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

## Thinking lens: Systems and System Models (primary)

**Key question:** What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?

**Why this lens fits:** The river drainage basin is a physical system — precipitation, infiltration, run-off, erosion, transportation and deposition are interdependent processes forming a cascade; pupils must model how changes upstream or in land use propagate through the whole system to affect flood risk downstream.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- What assumptions does this model make, and how do they limit its predictions?
- Are there tipping points where small changes produce large systemic effects?
- How would you choose between two competing models of this system?
- Can this phenomenon be explained by looking at parts alone, or does it require a systems perspective?

**Secondary lens:** Cause and Effect — Examining flood management strategies requires tracing how both physical causes (high rainfall, impermeable rock) and human causes (urbanisation, deforestation) combine to increase flood risk, and evaluating whether hard or soft engineering responses address root causes or merely symptoms.

## Session structure: Case Study + Fieldwork

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Case Study (main structure)
An in-depth investigation of a specific real-world example, location, or scenario. Starts with locating and describing the case in context, collects and organises relevant data, analyses patterns and processes, compares with other cases where appropriate, and reaches an evaluative conclusion.

`locate_and_describe` → `introduction` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `comparison` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Written case study report with data presentation (tables, graphs, maps), analysis of findings, and evaluative conclusion that addresses the original enquiry question.

**Teacher note:** Use the CASE STUDY template: frame the case within a broader theoretical or conceptual context. Expect pupils to select and justify appropriate data collection methods. Guide critical analysis using subject-specific frameworks and quantitative techniques where appropriate. Demand evaluative conclusions that consider the typicality of the case and the generalisability of findings.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does this case illustrate or challenge the broader theory?
- What are the strengths and weaknesses of the data collection methods used?
- To what extent can we generalise from this case study?
- How would you evaluate the significance of your findings in the wider context?

### Fieldwork
Learning through direct observation and data collection in the field (or simulated field environment). Includes preparation and planning, systematic data collection using fieldwork techniques, data processing and presentation, analysis of findings, and a conclusion that addresses the enquiry question.

`preparation` → `field_data_collection` → `processing` → `analysis` → `conclusion`

**Assessment:** Fieldwork report including methodology, data presentation using appropriate techniques (maps, graphs, tables, photographs), analysis of patterns, and conclusion with evaluation of data reliability.

**Teacher note:** Use the FIELDWORK template: expect pupils to design a fieldwork methodology with justified sampling, appropriate quantitative and qualitative techniques, and risk assessment. Demand rigorous data processing including statistical analysis where appropriate. Guide critical evaluation of methodology, data quality, and conclusions, with reference to how fieldwork evidence supports or challenges geographical or scientific theory.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does your sampling strategy ensure your data is representative?
- What statistical techniques will you use to analyse your field data?
- How do your fieldwork conclusions relate to the broader geographical or scientific theory?
- What methodological improvements would strengthen your investigation?

## Why this study matters

Coastal landscapes is the second compulsory UK physical landscape option at GCSE. It develops the same process-based analytical framework as rivers (erosion, transportation, deposition) but applies it to a different environment. Coastal management is particularly rich because it forces pupils to evaluate competing strategies (hard engineering, soft engineering, managed retreat) and consider the economic, social and environmental trade-offs involved. The Holderness coast and Dorset coast are classic UK case studies.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Teaching coastal landforms as a list (stack, arch, cave) without explaining the SEQUENCE of processes that creates them
2. Treating coastal management as a simple choice between 'protect' and 'don't protect' rather than analysing who benefits and who loses
3. Confusing erosion processes (hydraulic action, abrasion) with transportation processes (longshore drift)

## Sensitive content

- Coastal erosion can destroy homes and communities — some pupils may live in at-risk coastal areas
- Managed retreat involves deliberate decisions to abandon properties — discuss the human impact alongside the geographical rationale

---

## Success criteria

**Pupils can:**
- Explain how waves erode, transport and deposit material to create coastal landforms
- Describe the sequence: cave → arch → stack → stump using process vocabulary
- Analyse the costs and benefits of hard and soft coastal management strategies
- Evaluate whether managed retreat is a viable strategy using named case study evidence

## Geographical skills (KS4)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Using maps, atlases and globes** — Locating and identifying places in the United Kingdom and wider world using world maps, atlases and globes as reference tools, understanding that these are representations of the real world at reduced scale.
- **Using compass directions and locational language** — Applying the four cardinal compass directions (North, South, East, West) and everyday directional language such as near, far, left and right to describe the location of features and routes on maps and in the environment.
- **Using aerial photographs and making simple maps** — Interpreting aerial photographs and plan-perspective images to recognise landmarks and physical and human features, and translating these observations into a simple hand-drawn map with a basic symbol key.
- **Simple fieldwork and observational skills** — Going out into the school grounds and immediate surrounding environment to observe, describe and record human and physical geographical features at first hand, practising the habits of direct geographical enquiry.
- **Using maps, atlases, globes and digital mapping** — Extending atlas and map use to locate countries and describe the features studied across the curriculum, and beginning to use digital and computer mapping tools — including online satellite maps — to access geographical information in a range of formats.
- **Eight-point compass and Ordnance Survey map skills** — Applying the eight compass points, four-figure and six-figure grid references, and the symbols and conventions of Ordnance Survey maps to build knowledge of the UK and the wider world, and to navigate and locate features on topographic maps.
