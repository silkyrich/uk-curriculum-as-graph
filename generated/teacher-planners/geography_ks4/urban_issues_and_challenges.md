## Enquiry questions

1. Can cities grow sustainably, or is rapid urbanisation always a problem?

---

## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Urbanisation and Slum Development (GE-KS4-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The process by which an increasing proportion of a country's population lives in urban areas, driven by rural-urban migration and natural population growth in cities, producing both economic opportunities and social and environmental challenges, particularly in LICs and NEEs where growth is rapid and informal settlements develop.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach the process of rural-urban migration using the push-pull framework: rural push factors (agricultural mechanisation, land scarcity, drought, poverty, lack of services) and urban pull factors (employment opportunities, higher wages, better education and healthcare). The growth of informal settlements (slums, favelas, shanty towns) is the result of rapid urban growth outpacing formal housing provision — the largest slums (Dharavi in Mumbai, Kibera in Nairobi) house millions of people in dense, poorly serviced areas. Case study teaching should use specific data: population of the city, growth rate, proportion living in informal settlements, specific challenges, and specific improvement strategies. GCSE questions frequently ask for 'two challenges for cities in LICs' (4 marks) or 'assess the effectiveness of strategies to improve slum conditions' (6-8 marks).

**Key vocabulary:** urbanisation, rural-urban migration, push factor, pull factor, informal settlement, slum, favela, shanty town, megacity, counter-urbanisation, re-urbanisation, natural increase, infrastructure, sanitation, squatter settlement, urban hierarchy

**Common misconceptions:** Students often conflate urbanisation (the process by which a greater proportion of the population becomes urban) with urban growth (the absolute increase in urban population), not recognising that a country can experience urban growth without urbanisation. Students frequently portray informal settlements solely as problems to be solved, without recognising the agency and community resilience of residents, or the economic functions slums serve. Students sometimes assume that all cities in LICs are growing while all cities in HICs are stable, overlooking re-urbanisation in HICs and slowing growth in some LIC cities.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can state that cities are growing and that some cities have slums, but cannot explain the process of urbanisation or the push-pull factors driving rural-urban migration. | Why do people move from the countryside to cities in low-income countries? | Giving only one generic reason without specific detail; Not distinguishing between push and pull factors |
| **Developing** | Can explain the causes of urbanisation using the push-pull model, describe the challenges of rapid urban growth in LIC/NEE cities using a named case study, and identify some management strategies. | Describe the challenges faced by people living in informal settlements in a named LIC or NEE city. (4 marks) | Describing informal settlements in entirely negative terms without acknowledging economic activity and community resilience; Not using specific data or named examples |
| **Secure** | Can analyse urbanisation challenges in contrasting contexts (HIC and LIC/NEE), evaluate improvement strategies, and explain the relationship between urbanisation, development and inequality. | Compare the urban challenges faced by a named LIC/NEE city and a named UK city. Evaluate how effectively each city is addressing its challenges. (9 marks) | Describing challenges without evaluating the effectiveness of management strategies; Not recognising that the nature and scale of urban challenges differ between HIC and LIC contexts |
| **Mastery** | Can critically evaluate urbanisation as a global process, analyse the interactions between urbanisation, development and environmental sustainability, and assess whether informal settlements represent failure or adaptation. | Some geographers argue that informal settlements should not be demolished but improved, because they represent rational solutions to housing shortages. Evaluate this argument. | Treating informal settlements as either entirely positive or entirely negative rather than recognising their complexity; Not considering the economic activity and social networks within informal settlements alongside their physical challenges |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *People move to cities to get jobs and a better life.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *In Dharavi, Mumbai, approximately 1 million people live in an area of just 2.1 square kilometres. Challenges include: overcrowding (some families share one-room homes); limited access to clean water (residents often share communal standpipes); inadequate sanitation (many areas lack proper sewage systems, leading to waterborne disease); and poor air quality from small-scale industrial workshops located within residential areas. Despite these challenges, Dharavi has a thriving informal economy worth an estimated $1 billion annually, including recycling, pottery and leather goods.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Lagos (Nigeria) and Manchester (UK) both face significant urban challenges but in different forms. Lagos is growing at approximately 3% annually, adding hundreds of thousands of people each year. Its challenges include: massive informal settlement growth (about 60% of the population lives in informal housing); inadequate infrastructure (regular flooding due to poor drainage, frequent power cuts); traffic congestion (average commute times exceeding 3 hours); and water pollution from untreated sewage and industrial waste. Management strategies include the Eko Atlantic project (a new city district built on reclaimed land) and slum upgrading programmes, though these have been criticised for prioritising wealthy residents and displacing the poor. Manchester faces different challenges: deindustrialisation left areas of high deprivation in inner-city districts like Moss Side; the housing market is polarised between expensive city-centre apartments and poor-quality social housing; traffic congestion and air pollution affect health. Regeneration strategies include the MediaCityUK development in Salford, the Northern Quarter's creative industries growth, and investment in tram networks. These have been more successful in creating employment than in reducing inequality. The key difference is that Manchester's challenges are about managing the consequences of economic restructuring in a wealthy country, while Lagos's challenges are about providing basic services for a rapidly growing population in a country with limited government revenue and infrastructure.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *The argument for improving rather than demolishing informal settlements is increasingly supported by evidence from urban geography and development studies. Informal settlements arise because formal housing provision cannot keep pace with urban population growth: they represent a rational response by people who need shelter and cannot access or afford formal housing. Demolition programmes (as in Lagos, Karachi and many Chinese cities) typically displace residents without providing adequate alternatives, destroy established communities and economic networks, and may actually worsen the housing crisis by reducing the total housing stock. The economic contribution of informal settlements is often substantial: Dharavi's informal economy generates approximately $1 billion annually through recycling, manufacturing and services. Improvement strategies (in-situ upgrading) can deliver better outcomes: providing basic services (water, sanitation, electricity), securing land tenure (giving residents legal rights to their plots), improving access roads, and supporting community-led development can transform living conditions without destroying communities. The Orangi Pilot Project in Karachi, where residents organised to build their own sewage system at a fraction of the cost of a government scheme, demonstrates the potential of community-driven improvement. However, the argument has limitations: some informal settlements are located in genuinely dangerous areas (floodplains, unstable hillsides, industrial waste sites) where improvement is not safe and relocation is necessary. The key analytical point is that informal settlements exist on a spectrum from desperately dangerous to functioning communities that need targeted investment, and policy should be differentiated rather than uniform.*

### Secondary concept: The Development Gap (GE-KS4-C006)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The disparity in wealth, economic opportunity, health outcomes, and living standards between the world's richest and poorest countries, measured through a range of development indicators, and explained by the interaction of physical, historical, economic, and political factors.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify that some countries are richer than others but cannot use development indicators or explain the causes of the development gap. | Not using any specific development indicators to measure the gap; Treating development as purely about money |
| **Developing** | Can use development indicators to describe global patterns of inequality, explain several causes of the development gap, and describe strategies for reducing it. | Listing causes without explaining how they create and perpetuate inequality; Attributing the development gap to a single factor rather than recognising multiple interacting causes |
| **Secure** | Can construct detailed analytical arguments about the causes of the development gap, evaluate strategies for reducing inequality with specific evidence, and use named country case studies. | Evaluating each strategy in isolation without comparing their relative effectiveness; Not using specific named examples and data to support evaluations |
| **Mastery** | Can critically evaluate the concept of development itself, assess the power dynamics embedded in development strategies, and connect development geography to broader debates about global justice and sustainability. | Either accepting the concept uncritically or dismissing it entirely without acknowledging its usefulness; Not recognising that inequality exists within countries as well as between them |

### Secondary concept: Cartographic and Map Skills (GE-KS4-C009)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

The ability to read, interpret, construct, and critically evaluate a range of map types including OS maps, atlas maps, choropleth maps, dot maps, isoline maps, flow-line maps, and GIS-based digital maps, to answer geographical questions about location, distribution, pattern, and spatial relationship.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|

| **Developing** | Can use four and six-figure grid references accurately, interpret basic contour patterns to describe relief, use scale to measure distances, and identify land use patterns from map symbols. | Describing what is on the map without interpreting what it means geographically (e.g. describing contour lines without interpreting relief); Not using specific heights from contour lines |
| **Secure** | Can construct and interpret a range of map types (choropleth, isoline, proportional), use maps to answer geographical questions, and evaluate the advantages and limitations of different cartographic techniques. | Describing each map type without comparing their relative strengths; Not recognising that choropleth maps can be misleading because they imply uniform distribution within areas |
| **Mastery** | Can critically evaluate how cartographic choices shape the viewer's understanding, use GIS as an analytical tool, and recognise how maps can both reveal and conceal geographical realities. | Treating maps as objective representations of reality rather than as constructed artefacts that involve choices; Not considering how the same data could be mapped differently to convey different messages |

### Secondary concept: Geographical Statistical Skills (GE-KS4-C010)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The selection, application, and interpretation of numerical and statistical techniques to process geographical data, identify patterns and correlations, test hypotheses, and evaluate the reliability of data sets.

#### Differentiation

| **Secure** | Can calculate and interpret Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, test results against significance tables, and use statistical evidence to support geographical arguments. | Calculating Spearman's rank without testing the result against the critical value for significance; Stating that correlation proves causation rather than indicating a relationship |
| **Mastery** | Can select and justify appropriate statistical techniques for different types of data, critically evaluate the limitations of statistical analysis in geography, and use statistics as evidence within broader geographical arguments. | Treating statistical significance as proof rather than as evidence that supports a hypothesis; Not recognising the limitations of applying statistical techniques to small fieldwork datasets |

### Secondary concept: Sustainable Urban Development (GE-KS4-C013)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Strategies for managing urban growth in environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable ways, including sustainable transport, green infrastructure, energy efficiency in buildings, waste reduction, and community-based urban regeneration.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify that cities should try to be more sustainable but cannot define sustainability or explain specific strategies for achieving it. | Defining sustainability only in environmental terms without considering social and economic dimensions; Not giving any specific examples of sustainable urban strategies |
| **Developing** | Can define sustainability across its three dimensions (environmental, social, economic) and describe specific strategies for sustainable urban development with named examples. | Describing strategies without explaining how they contribute to sustainability; Not using specific named examples |
| **Secure** | Can evaluate named examples of sustainable urban development against multiple criteria, assess the trade-offs involved, and explain why achieving sustainability requires addressing all three dimensions. | Describing the features of BedZED without evaluating how effective they have been in practice; Not considering whether the model can be scaled up to the level of whole cities |
| **Mastery** | Can critically evaluate the concept of sustainable urban development, analyse the tensions between sustainability and other urban priorities, and assess whether genuinely sustainable cities are achievable. | Treating sustainable urban development as either easily achievable or fundamentally impossible without engaging with the specific barriers and enablers; Not considering the tension between environmental sustainability and social equity |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Explaining rapid urban growth in lower-income countries requires pupils to trace the push-pull causal chain from rural poverty and environmental stress through migration decisions to the social, economic and environmental consequences of informal settlement growth.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- Is this a necessary cause, a sufficient cause, or a contributing factor?
- What confounding variables could explain this relationship?
- How would you design an investigation to establish causation, not just correlation?
- In this causal chain, where could an intervention have the most effect?

**Secondary lens:** Stability and Change — Urban sustainability is fundamentally about managing change — evaluating whether regeneration strategies, transport investment and planning policies can transition cities from unsustainable to sustainable trajectories requires reasoning about what kind of change is desirable and whether it is durable.

## Session structure: Case Study + Comparison Study

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Case Study (main structure)
An in-depth investigation of a specific real-world example, location, or scenario. Starts with locating and describing the case in context, collects and organises relevant data, analyses patterns and processes, compares with other cases where appropriate, and reaches an evaluative conclusion.

`locate_and_describe` → `introduction` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `comparison` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Written case study report with data presentation (tables, graphs, maps), analysis of findings, and evaluative conclusion that addresses the original enquiry question.

**Teacher note:** Use the CASE STUDY template: frame the case within a broader theoretical or conceptual context. Expect pupils to select and justify appropriate data collection methods. Guide critical analysis using subject-specific frameworks and quantitative techniques where appropriate. Demand evaluative conclusions that consider the typicality of the case and the generalisability of findings.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does this case illustrate or challenge the broader theory?
- What are the strengths and weaknesses of the data collection methods used?
- To what extent can we generalise from this case study?
- How would you evaluate the significance of your findings in the wider context?

### Comparison Study
A structured comparison of two or more examples, places, periods, or perspectives. Introduces each example with sufficient context, applies a systematic comparison framework, analyses similarities and differences with supporting evidence, and reaches an evaluative conclusion about the significance of those differences.

`introduce_examples` → `systematic_comparison` → `analysis` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Comparative analysis using a structured framework (table, Venn diagram, or essay), demonstrating understanding of both examples and reaching a substantiated evaluative conclusion.

**Teacher note:** Use the COMPARISON STUDY template: frame the comparison within a theoretical or conceptual framework. Expect independent identification of appropriate criteria and rigorous analysis using subject-specific terminology. Demand an evaluative conclusion that assesses the extent of similarity or difference and its significance, considering limitations of the comparative method itself.

**KS4 question stems:**
- What theoretical framework underpins your choice of comparison criteria?
- To what extent do the similarities outweigh the differences, and what does this suggest?
- What are the limitations of comparing these two cases?
- How would you construct a sustained evaluative argument from this comparison?

## Contrasting localities

### Lagos vs London: Urbanisation in LIC and HIC
Contrasting Lagos and London prevents the common trap of studying only 'problem' urbanisation in LICs. Both cities face genuine challenges (housing costs, pollution, transport congestion) but of fundamentally different kinds. The comparison illuminates how development level shapes the urbanisation experience while revealing universal urban challenges.

**Compare through:** rate of urban growth, informal vs formal housing, transport infrastructure, economic opportunity, environmental quality, governance and planning
**Stimulus questions:**
- Lagos is growing 6x faster than London. What are the consequences of this speed?
- Both cities have housing crises. How are they different, and how are they similar?
- Is rapid urbanisation a problem or an opportunity? For whom?
- What can Lagos and London learn from each other about sustainable urban planning?


---

## Why this study matters

Urban Issues extends KS3 urbanisation work (Lagos/London) to GCSE-level analysis requiring named case studies of a UK city and a LIC/NEE city. The study demands comparison of urbanisation challenges in different development contexts, evaluation of sustainability strategies, and understanding of the complex processes driving urban change. Pupils must integrate physical geography (flood risk, climate) with human geography (migration, deprivation, planning).

## Sequencing

**Follows:** Urbanisation: Lagos and London

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Studying only the 'problems' of LIC/NEE cities without acknowledging their dynamism, economic opportunity and cultural richness
2. Treating UK cities as uniformly prosperous and LIC cities as uniformly poor — internal inequalities exist in both contexts
3. Describing urban change without analysing the PROCESSES driving it (economic restructuring, deindustrialisation, migration)

## Sensitive content

- Urban deprivation may directly affect pupils — avoid treating deprived areas as case studies for outside observation
- Homelessness is a visible urban issue — discuss with empathy and structural analysis, not stigma
- Gentrification can displace existing communities — acknowledge the human cost alongside economic benefits

---

## Success criteria

**Pupils can:**
- Explain the causes and consequences of urbanisation at global and local scales
- Compare urban challenges in a named UK city and a named LIC/NEE city
- Evaluate urban regeneration strategies using named case study evidence
- Assess the potential for sustainable urban living in UK cities

## Geographical skills (KS4)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Using maps, atlases and globes** — Locating and identifying places in the United Kingdom and wider world using world maps, atlases and globes as reference tools, understanding that these are representations of the real world at reduced scale.
- **Using compass directions and locational language** — Applying the four cardinal compass directions (North, South, East, West) and everyday directional language such as near, far, left and right to describe the location of features and routes on maps and in the environment.
- **Using aerial photographs and making simple maps** — Interpreting aerial photographs and plan-perspective images to recognise landmarks and physical and human features, and translating these observations into a simple hand-drawn map with a basic symbol key.
- **Simple fieldwork and observational skills** — Going out into the school grounds and immediate surrounding environment to observe, describe and record human and physical geographical features at first hand, practising the habits of direct geographical enquiry.
- **Using maps, atlases, globes and digital mapping** — Extending atlas and map use to locate countries and describe the features studied across the curriculum, and beginning to use digital and computer mapping tools — including online satellite maps — to access geographical information in a range of formats.
- **Eight-point compass and Ordnance Survey map skills** — Applying the eight compass points, four-figure and six-figure grid references, and the symbols and conventions of Ordnance Survey maps to build knowledge of the UK and the wider world, and to navigate and locate features on topographic maps.
