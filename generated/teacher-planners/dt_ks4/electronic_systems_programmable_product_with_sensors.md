## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Iterative Design Process (DT-KS4-C002)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

The iterative design process is a cyclical model of design activity in which design ideas are repeatedly generated, tested, evaluated and refined through multiple cycles until an effective design solution is achieved. Unlike the linear design model (brief → research → idea → prototype → evaluation), the iterative model acknowledges that design problems are not fully understood at the outset, that evaluation at any stage may require returning to earlier stages, and that prototyping and testing are integral to the development of ideas rather than merely their verification. At GCSE, the iterative design process is reflected in the non-examined assessment, which requires pupils to document the development of their design through multiple iterations.

**Teaching guidance:** Model the iterative design process explicitly: show pupils examples of real design development in which early ideas are substantially revised in response to testing and evaluation. Require pupils to produce and evaluate multiple design iterations rather than moving directly from initial idea to final prototype. Develop reflective evaluation habits: after each iteration, what worked? What did not? What needs to change? Connect iteration to the broader design process: how does testing a prototype inform the next design iteration? For examination questions about design process, practise structuring responses that show understanding of iteration as a design method rather than simply a sequence of steps.

**Key vocabulary:** iterative, design cycle, prototype, testing, evaluation, feedback, refinement, specification, brief, research, development, CAD, modelling, user testing, iteration

**Common misconceptions:** Many pupils think of the design process as a linear sequence of steps, not understanding that effective design requires returning to earlier stages as new information emerges. The concept of 'failure' in prototyping is often misunderstood; a prototype that reveals a problem has succeeded as a testing tool, even if it fails as a product. Students may conflate the school assessment submission (a record of work done) with the design process itself; the process and its documentation are different things.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Understands that design is a process of developing ideas to solve a problem, and can sketch initial design ideas with basic annotations. | Sketch three different ideas for a phone holder that sits on a desk. Annotate each with materials and one key feature. | Drawing only one idea rather than generating a range of alternatives; Sketching without any annotation about materials, dimensions, or how the design works |
| **Developing** | Follows a structured iterative design process: research, specification, ideation, development, making, testing, evaluation. Uses modelling and prototyping to refine ideas before final making. | Describe how you would use modelling to develop your phone holder design before making the final product. | Going straight to final material without modelling, leading to expensive mistakes; Treating modelling as a one-off activity rather than an iterative cycle of test-modify-retest |
| **Secure** | Manages the full design cycle independently, using research to inform the specification, systematic ideation techniques (morphological analysis, SCAMPER), controlled testing against specification, and evidence-based design decisions at each iteration. | Explain how you would use a morphological chart to generate design ideas for a portable reading light, then narrow down to a final concept. | Using morphological charts to generate combinations without then evaluating them against the specification; Selecting a final design based on personal preference rather than evidence from testing and user feedback |
| **Mastery** | Critically analyses the iterative design process as used in industry, evaluates design methodologies (user-centred design, design thinking, agile), and reflects on how constraints (time, cost, regulation, sustainability) shape the design outcome. | Compare user-centred design with technology-push approaches. Use a specific product example to evaluate which approach leads to better outcomes and why. | Treating user-centred design and technology-push as mutually exclusive rather than complementary; Not recognising that iterative design has diminishing returns — at some point, further iteration costs more than the improvement it delivers |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Idea 1: L-shaped acrylic stand with a groove for the phone — simple, clear, can see screen. Idea 2: Wooden cradle with adjustable angle — more comfortable viewing but more complex to make. Idea 3: Wire frame holder bent from steel rod — lightweight and modern-looking but may scratch the phone.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *I would first make a card model to test the proportions and viewing angle — card is quick and cheap to work with. I would test it with different phone sizes to check compatibility. Based on feedback, I would modify the dimensions and then make a 3D-printed prototype in PLA to test structural integrity under load. This iterative process — model, test, modify — means the final version in acrylic is more likely to succeed first time, saving material and workshop time.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *I would create a morphological chart with parameters: power source (battery, USB, solar), light type (LED strip, single LED, panel), housing material (3D-printed PLA, bent aluminium, laser-cut plywood), clip mechanism (spring clip, magnetic, weighted base), and switch type (toggle, touch sensor, twist). By combining one option from each row, I can systematically generate diverse concepts — e.g. solar-powered LED panel in bent aluminium with magnetic mount and touch sensor. I would evaluate each combination against my specification (portability weight < 100g, brightness > 200 lumens, cost < £5 materials) and select the top three for quick card modelling. User feedback on the models would determine the final concept.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *User-centred design (UCD) starts with user needs: research (interviews, observation), define (personas, specification), ideate, prototype, test with users, iterate. Technology-push starts with a new capability and finds applications. Example — Dyson vacuum cleaners: the original DC01 was technology-push (cyclone separation applied to vacuum cleaning). However, subsequent models used UCD — testing showed users wanted lighter weight, better manoeuvrability, and easier bin emptying, which drove the shift to ball technology and cordless designs. Neither approach is universally better: technology-push creates breakthrough innovations (no user would have asked for cyclone separation), but UCD ensures the product actually solves real problems and is usable. The most successful products combine both — a novel technology refined through iterative user testing. The design process itself is a design decision that should be matched to the context.*

### Secondary concept: Material Properties and Selection (DT-KS4-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Material properties are the specific physical, mechanical, electrical, thermal and aesthetic characteristics that determine how a material behaves and what it can appropriately be used for. Physical properties include density, hardness, strength, elasticity and malleability. Mechanical properties include stiffness, toughness and compressive and tensile strength. Thermal properties include conductivity and resistance. Electrical properties include conductivity and resistance. Aesthetic properties include texture, colour, translucency and surface quality. Material selection requires matching the properties of available materials to the specific demands of a design brief, considering also cost, availability, environmental impact, and the manufacturing processes required to work with the material.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Names common materials (wood, metal, plastic, textile) and describes basic properties such as hard, soft, flexible, rigid, waterproof. | Choosing a material without linking the choice to specific required properties; Not considering food safety or hygiene when selecting materials for kitchen products |
| **Developing** | Classifies materials by type (hardwood, softwood, ferrous/non-ferrous metal, thermoforming/thermosetting polymer) and selects materials based on multiple properties including mechanical, physical, and working characteristics. | Comparing only one property (e.g. strength) without considering the full range of requirements; Not recognising that strength-to-weight ratio matters more than absolute strength for weight-critical applications |
| **Secure** | Analyses material properties quantitatively using data sheets, understands how material structure affects properties (grain structure, polymer chains, alloy composition), and selects materials with justified trade-offs for specific design contexts. | Selecting materials on a single headline property without checking that other critical requirements are met; Not linking macroscopic properties (impact resistance) to material microstructure (polymer chain flexibility) |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates material selection in the context of full product lifecycle including processing, cost, supply chain, environmental impact, and emerging materials. Analyses how smart and modern materials extend the design palette. | Concluding that the highest-performing material is always the best choice without considering manufacture, cost, and sustainability; Not recognising that CFRP's end-of-life limitations are a significant sustainability concern that affects design decisions |

### Secondary concept: CAD/CAM and Digital Manufacturing (DT-KS4-C004)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Computer-Aided Design (CAD) refers to the use of software to create, modify, analyse and optimise design drawings and models. Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) refers to the use of computer-controlled manufacturing equipment to produce parts from digital design files. Common CAM processes include laser cutting, 3D printing (additive manufacturing), CNC milling and routing, and vinyl cutting. The integration of CAD and CAM enables rapid prototyping, design iteration and small-batch manufacture with a precision that hand manufacturing cannot match, and reflects the dominant mode of contemporary industrial design and manufacturing.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Recognises that computers can be used to design and make products, and can name basic CAD software and manufacturing equipment (3D printers, laser cutters). | Stating CAD is 'faster' without specifying what makes it faster (modification, duplication, sharing); Not distinguishing between CAD (design software) and CAM (manufacturing using computer-controlled machines) |
| **Developing** | Uses CAD software to create 2D and 3D designs with accurate dimensions, and understands how these designs are prepared for CAM processes such as 3D printing, laser cutting, and CNC routing. | Not accounting for laser kerf (material removed by the beam) when designing press-fit joints; Exporting files in the wrong format — laser cutters typically need DXF or SVG vector files, not image files |
| **Secure** | Selects appropriate CAD/CAM processes based on product requirements (material, geometry, accuracy, batch size), understands the capabilities and limitations of each process, and optimises designs for specific manufacturing methods. | Recommending 3D printing for functional parts under stress without considering anisotropic weakness between layers; Not considering that CNC is subtractive (material waste) while 3D printing is additive (minimal waste) when comparing sustainability |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates how digital manufacturing technologies are transforming industrial production, analyses the implications of Industry 4.0 (automation, IoT, digital twins), and critically assesses the environmental and social impacts of CAD/CAM in manufacturing. | Claiming digital manufacturing will 'replace' all traditional manufacturing without recognising that mass production remains more efficient for high-volume identical products; Not considering the social impact of automation on employment alongside the technical and environmental benefits |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** GCSE material selection requires pupils to rigorously match a material's structural properties (tensile strength, malleability, thermal conductivity) to the functional demands of a product specification — every selection decision is a structure-function argument.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- How do structural features at different scales interact to produce this function?
- What structural constraints limit what this system can do?
- Why have unrelated organisms evolved similar structures for similar functions?
- How would you apply structure-function analysis to improve this design?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Justifying material selection in GCSE examinations requires a structured argument: a candidate must state which material property meets which design requirement and cite evidence (material data, test results) to support the choice.

## Session structure: Design, Make, Evaluate

### Design, Make, Evaluate
The core Design & Technology cycle. Pupils investigate existing products and user needs, design a solution with clear specifications, plan the making process, construct using appropriate materials and techniques, test against the design brief, and evaluate the outcome with suggestions for improvement.

`investigate` → `design` → `plan` → `make` → `test` → `evaluate`

**Assessment:** Design portfolio including investigation findings, annotated design with specifications, making log, test results, and evaluative conclusion comparing outcome to original brief.

**Teacher note:** Use the DESIGN, MAKE AND EVALUATE template: expect a rigorous design process including contextual research, user analysis, and iterative development. Demand detailed technical drawings, material justification, and manufacturing plans. Guide making with focus on precision, consistency, and professional finish. Evaluate critically against the brief, user feedback, manufacturing feasibility, and sustainability, connecting to exam-standard assessment criteria.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does your design respond to contextual research and user needs?
- What is the manufacturing rationale for your choice of materials and processes?
- How does the quality of your final product demonstrate precision and skill?
- How would you evaluate your product against the brief, user feedback, and sustainability criteria?

## Design and Technology: Electronic Systems

**Design brief:** Design and make a product that uses a microcontroller and at least two sensors to respond intelligently to its environment. Examples: a plant watering monitor (soil moisture + light), a room comfort monitor (temperature + humidity), a security device (motion + sound). The product must have a well-designed housing.

**Materials:** Arduino or micro:bit, sensors (temperature, moisture, light, motion, ultrasonic), actuators (LEDs, buzzer, servo motor, relay), stripboard or PCB, soldering materials, housing materials (3D-printed, laser-cut, or fabricated)
**Tools:** soldering station, wire strippers and cutters, multimeter, oscilloscope (if available), computer for programming, workshop tools for housing
**Techniques:** circuit design and schematic drawing, breadboard prototyping, soldering to stripboard or PCB, programming sensor input and actuator output, housing design and assembly, system testing and debugging
**Safety notes:** Soldering: well-ventilated area, safety glasses, soldering station with stand. Lead-free solder preferred. Never solder live circuits. Low voltage only (5V max). Wash hands after soldering. All circuits must be checked by the teacher before powering on. PAT testing any mains-powered equipment used.

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Does the product respond correctly to both sensor inputs?
- Is the circuit well-constructed (neat soldering, no dry joints)?
- Is the code well-structured and commented?
- Does the housing integrate the electronics effectively?

## Why this study matters

GCSE-level electronic systems require pupils to design circuits with multiple inputs and outputs controlled by a programmable microcontroller. A product that uses multiple sensors (temperature, light, motion, proximity) to respond intelligently to its environment demonstrates the embedded computing concepts in the specification. The project integrates electronics, programming, and product design into a single assessed outcome.

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Attempting too many features -- start with one sensor and one output, then add complexity incrementally
2. Poor soldering causing intermittent faults -- teach soldering technique on practice boards before the real circuit
3. Housing design as an afterthought -- design the housing and the circuit simultaneously; they must fit together
