## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Human Factors, Ergonomics and Inclusive Design (DT-KS4-C003)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Human factors is the study of how people interact with designed objects and systems, with the aim of optimising that interaction for safety, comfort, efficiency and effectiveness. Ergonomics applies human factors knowledge to the design of products: ensuring that objects fit the human body (anthropometrics), are cognitively manageable (usability), and meet the physical, sensory and cognitive capabilities of their intended users. Inclusive design — also called universal design — extends ergonomic thinking to ensure that products are usable by the widest possible range of people, including those with disabilities, across the full age range and in diverse cultural contexts.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce anthropometric data (percentile tables for body dimensions) and teach pupils to apply this data in product design. Develop user research skills: how do you find out what users actually need? Practise user testing of prototypes: observing users interacting with a prototype reveals usability issues that are invisible to the designer. Explore inclusive design principles through case studies: how was this product designed to be accessible to users with visual impairment? Physical disabilities? Limited hand strength? For examination questions, practise explaining how specific design features address specific human factors considerations. Connect ergonomics to sustainability: well-designed ergonomic products are more likely to be used effectively and retained rather than discarded.

**Key vocabulary:** ergonomics, anthropometrics, inclusive design, universal design, user research, usability, accessibility, prototype, percentile, cognitive load, user testing, disability, accessibility standard, user need, function

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may think ergonomics is only about physical comfort (chair height, handle grip) rather than also addressing cognitive, sensory and emotional dimensions of user experience. The concept of designing for the full range of users, not the 'average' user, is counterintuitive to many; teaching that designing for the extremes often improves the experience for everyone addresses this. Students may conduct user research by asking people what they want rather than observing what they actually do; developing observational user research methods is more effective in practice.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Recognises that products should be designed for people of different sizes and abilities, and that comfort and ease of use are important design considerations. | Explain why a one-size-fits-all approach to designing a school chair might not work for all students. | Assuming that designing for the 'average' person works for everyone; Not considering that comfort affects concentration and learning, not just physical wellbeing |
| **Developing** | Uses anthropometric data (body measurements) to inform design decisions, understands the concept of percentile ranges (5th to 95th), and applies basic ergonomic principles to ensure products fit the user. | A door handle is being designed for a public building. Explain how you would use anthropometric data to determine the handle height. | Designing for the 50th percentile (average) rather than the 5th-95th percentile range; Using anthropometric data for one population group and applying it universally without considering diversity |
| **Secure** | Applies ergonomic principles (posture, grip, reach, force) and anthropometric data to specific design contexts. Considers inclusive design for users with a range of abilities, ages, and physical characteristics. | Design the handle for a garden tool that will be used by elderly users with reduced grip strength. Apply ergonomic and inclusive design principles. | Designing for disability as a separate 'special' category rather than applying inclusive principles that benefit all users; Specifying ergonomic features without justifying them with specific data about user capabilities |
| **Mastery** | Critically evaluates how human factors research informs commercial product design, analyses the tension between inclusive design and market segmentation, and proposes design strategies that balance ergonomic optimisation with manufacturing and commercial constraints. | Evaluate the claim that 'truly inclusive design is impossible — all products must make trade-offs that exclude some users.' Use specific product examples. | Accepting user exclusion as inevitable without exploring adjustable or adaptive design solutions; Not recognising that inclusive design often drives innovation that benefits all users, not just those with specific needs |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Students come in different heights and sizes. A chair designed for the average student would be too tall for shorter students (feet dangling, uncomfortable) and too small for taller students (knees too high, back pain). Different sizes or adjustable chairs are needed.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *I would use anthropometric data for hand height during a comfortable reaching posture. The handle should be usable by the 5th percentile adult female (shortest likely users) to the 95th percentile adult male (tallest likely users). Standard data gives a comfortable handle height of 900-1050 mm from the floor. I would also consider wheelchair users, for whom a lower handle (around 900 mm) is needed. A height of 900 mm would accommodate the widest range of users including wheelchair users.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Ergonomic analysis: elderly users often have reduced grip strength (average 15-20 kg vs 40-50 kg for younger adults), limited finger dexterity, and may have arthritis affecting joint flexion. Handle design: diameter 30-35 mm (larger than standard 25 mm to reduce required grip force), soft rubber overmould for comfort and friction, contoured finger grips to distribute pressure, angled at 15° to reduce wrist deviation during use. The handle should be long enough to allow a two-handed grip (300 mm). A loop strap prevents dropping. Material: polypropylene core for rigidity, TPE overmould for softness. These principles also benefit users with temporary injuries, making the design inclusive rather than specialised.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *The claim has merit but overstates the case. All physical products face geometric constraints — a handle optimised for small hands compromises comfort for large hands. However, adjustability resolves many conflicts: Herman Miller's Aeron chair offers 14 adjustments, accommodating the 5th-95th percentile across multiple body dimensions. The OXO Good Grips range demonstrates that designing for users with limited dexterity (Sam Farber designed for his wife's arthritis) created products that 95% of users prefer — inclusive design became a market advantage, not a compromise. True exclusion occurs when cost constraints prevent adjustability — budget office chairs offer minimal adjustment, excluding users at the extremes. Digital products can achieve near-universal inclusion through adaptive interfaces. The question is not whether trade-offs exist, but whether designers have genuinely explored the design space before accepting exclusion as inevitable. Most exclusion is a design failure, not an inherent necessity.*

### Secondary concept: Iterative Design Process (DT-KS4-C002)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

The iterative design process is a cyclical model of design activity in which design ideas are repeatedly generated, tested, evaluated and refined through multiple cycles until an effective design solution is achieved. Unlike the linear design model (brief → research → idea → prototype → evaluation), the iterative model acknowledges that design problems are not fully understood at the outset, that evaluation at any stage may require returning to earlier stages, and that prototyping and testing are integral to the development of ideas rather than merely their verification. At GCSE, the iterative design process is reflected in the non-examined assessment, which requires pupils to document the development of their design through multiple iterations.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Understands that design is a process of developing ideas to solve a problem, and can sketch initial design ideas with basic annotations. | Drawing only one idea rather than generating a range of alternatives; Sketching without any annotation about materials, dimensions, or how the design works |
| **Developing** | Follows a structured iterative design process: research, specification, ideation, development, making, testing, evaluation. Uses modelling and prototyping to refine ideas before final making. | Going straight to final material without modelling, leading to expensive mistakes; Treating modelling as a one-off activity rather than an iterative cycle of test-modify-retest |
| **Secure** | Manages the full design cycle independently, using research to inform the specification, systematic ideation techniques (morphological analysis, SCAMPER), controlled testing against specification, and evidence-based design decisions at each iteration. | Using morphological charts to generate combinations without then evaluating them against the specification; Selecting a final design based on personal preference rather than evidence from testing and user feedback |
| **Mastery** | Critically analyses the iterative design process as used in industry, evaluates design methodologies (user-centred design, design thinking, agile), and reflects on how constraints (time, cost, regulation, sustainability) shape the design outcome. | Treating user-centred design and technology-push as mutually exclusive rather than complementary; Not recognising that iterative design has diminishing returns — at some point, further iteration costs more than the improvement it delivers |

## Thinking lens: Perspective and Interpretation (primary)

**Key question:** Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?

**Why this lens fits:** Human factors and inclusive design require pupils to evaluate a product's usability from the perspective of diverse users — including those with physical, sensory or cognitive differences — making perspective-taking the central analytical demand when assessing ergonomic and accessibility criteria.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- How do power structures determine whose perspective dominates this narrative?
- What are the epistemological limits of interpreting this source?
- How would you position your interpretation within the existing historiographical debate?
- Can two contradictory interpretations both be valid? Under what conditions?

**Secondary lens:** Stability and Change — Sustainability is fundamentally a stability question: responsible design asks whether a material or production system can remain viable over time without depleting resources or causing irreversible environmental change — the cluster demands reasoning about long-run system stability.

## Session structure: Research Enquiry

### Research Enquiry
A structured approach to answering questions through secondary research. Pupils formulate a research question, select appropriate sources, take and organise notes, synthesise findings from multiple sources, and present their conclusions. Develops information literacy alongside subject knowledge.

`question` → `source_selection` → `note_taking` → `synthesis` → `presentation`

**Assessment:** Research report or presentation that answers the original question using evidence from multiple sources, with evaluation of source reliability where appropriate.

**Teacher note:** Use the RESEARCH ENQUIRY template: set a complex research question requiring independent source selection and critical evaluation. Expect pupils to assess methodology and bias in secondary sources, cross-reference findings, identify gaps in the evidence base, and produce a well-structured synthesis that acknowledges uncertainty and competing claims.

**KS4 question stems:**
- What methodological strengths and weaknesses do your key sources have?
- What gaps exist in the available evidence, and how do they affect your conclusions?
- How would you resolve contradictions between your sources?
- How does your synthesis address competing claims and acknowledge uncertainty?

## Design and Technology: Human Factors

**Design brief:** Collect anthropometric data from your class. Analyse a poorly-designed everyday product (e.g. a tin opener, a bus seat, a school locker) and redesign it applying human factors principles. Present your redesign with annotated drawings showing how anthropometric data informed each decision.

**Materials:** existing product to analyse, measuring equipment, card for mock-ups
**Tools:** tape measures, spring balance (for grip strength), rulers and callipers, CAD software for redesign
**Techniques:** anthropometric data collection, percentile range analysis, product analysis against ergonomic criteria, annotated design communication, user testing with mock-ups
**Safety notes:** Grip strength testing: use calibrated equipment, not improvised tests. Anthropometric measurements: respect pupil privacy -- use anonymous data collection. Product disassembly: teacher-supervised if sharp tools needed.

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Is the anthropometric data accurately collected and analysed?
- Does the redesign demonstrably improve the product's ergonomics?
- Are human factors principles clearly annotated in the design?
- Has the redesign been tested with users?

## Why this study matters

Human factors and ergonomics are exam topics that pupils find abstract until they measure real anthropometric data and design for actual users. Collecting hand-span measurements, seated reach distances, and grip strength data from the class provides a real dataset for designing products that accommodate the 5th to 95th percentile range. Inclusive design case studies (OXO Good Grips, Dyson, adjustable furniture) show that designing for accessibility improves products for everyone.

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Treating ergonomics as an add-on rather than a design driver -- it must inform decisions from the start
2. Using only average measurements -- teach percentile ranges and the 'design for the extremes' principle
3. Confusing ergonomics (physical fit) with aesthetics (visual appeal)
