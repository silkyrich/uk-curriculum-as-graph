## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Evaluation Against Specification and User Needs (DT-KS4-C006)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Formal evaluation at GCSE involves systematically assessing a design outcome against both the original specification — the measurable criteria derived from the design brief — and the needs of the intended user. Effective evaluation is evidence-based: outcomes are tested against objective criteria rather than assessed through personal opinion. Methods include physical testing (does it meet strength, size, weight or capacity requirements?), user testing (does the intended user find it usable, comfortable and appealing?), and comparative analysis (how does it compare to existing products that address the same brief?). Evaluation findings are used to make justified recommendations for further development.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach pupils to distinguish between objective criteria (measurable, checkable) and subjective criteria (based on opinion and preference) in their design specifications, and to use both types in evaluation. Develop user testing protocols: how do you test a product with a real user in a structured way that produces useful feedback? Practise writing evaluation conclusions that reference specific evidence: 'The product met criterion 3 because...' rather than 'The product is good because I like it.' For examination preparation, practise structured evaluation responses that identify specific strengths and specific, justified areas for improvement. Connect evaluation back to the iterative design process: evaluation outcomes should feed into the next design iteration.

**Key vocabulary:** evaluate, specification, criterion, user need, test, evidence, objective, subjective, user feedback, strength, limitation, improvement, justify, recommend, fitness for purpose

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils frequently write evaluation that is entirely positive or is based on personal preference, rather than being referenced to the specification and user feedback. Teaching that honest evaluation of limitations is more valuable than praise — because it drives improvement — changes this. Some pupils confuse evaluation with description: saying what they made rather than assessing how well it meets its specification. The distinction between 'what I made' and 'how well it works' needs explicit teaching.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Identifies basic evaluation criteria such as whether a product works and whether it looks finished. Can state simple likes and dislikes about a product. | Look at a product you have made. State two things that work well and two things you would improve. | Giving vague opinions ('it's good') without linking to specific functional or aesthetic criteria; Only evaluating appearance and ignoring whether the product meets its functional purpose |
| **Developing** | Evaluates a product against its original design specification point by point, using testing evidence and user feedback to support judgements. | Evaluate your storage solution against the design specification. Use test results and user feedback to justify your assessment. | Evaluating generally without referring back to specific specification points; Stating a specification is 'met' without providing measurable evidence or test data |
| **Secure** | Conducts systematic evaluation using quantitative testing data, user trials, and comparison with existing commercial products. Proposes specific, justified modifications and considers manufacture at scale. | Evaluate your prototype phone stand against its specification, a commercial competitor, and user needs. Propose and justify two modifications for a production version. | Proposing modifications without considering cost, manufacturability, or material implications; Comparing with commercial products on appearance only rather than on performance metrics |
| **Mastery** | Critically evaluates the entire design-make-evaluate cycle, analysing the effectiveness of the design process itself and not just the outcome. Considers user needs beyond the specification, commercial viability, and iterative improvement strategy. | Critically evaluate both your product and your design process. Identify where in the process key decisions were made that affected the outcome, and propose a strategy for the next iteration. | Evaluating only the product outcome without reflecting critically on the design process decisions that led to it; Treating evaluation as a final step rather than as input to the next design iteration |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *It works well because the handle is comfortable to grip and the mechanism opens smoothly. I would improve the surface finish because it is rough in places, and I would make the base wider so it does not tip over.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Specification point 1: 'Must hold at least 2 kg.' Test result: it held 3.5 kg before deformation, so this is met with margin. Specification point 2: 'Must be easy for a child aged 6 to open.' User testing with three children showed two could open it independently, but one struggled with the clasp. This is partially met — the clasp could be replaced with a magnetic closure for easier operation.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *My prototype scored 4/5 on stability (tilt test to 20°) versus the commercial product's 5/5 (stable to 35°). User trials showed 8/10 users preferred my aesthetic design but noted the charging cable port was too narrow for some cables. Modification 1: widen the cable port to 15 mm (accommodates 95% of cables based on market survey) — costs minimal extra material. Modification 2: add a weighted rubber base to improve tilt stability — rubber sourcing adds £0.30 per unit but would match the commercial benchmark. Both modifications are viable for injection moulding at scale.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *The final product meets 7/8 specification points, but the failure in water resistance traces back to my material selection in week 3 — I chose MDF for machinability over marine plywood for moisture resistance. This was a process failure: I prioritised ease of making over fitness for purpose. User testing revealed an unanticipated need (portability) not captured in my specification, suggesting my initial research phase was too narrow — I surveyed users about home use only. For the next iteration: (1) revise the specification to include portability, (2) replace MDF with HDPE (waterproof, lightweight, injection-mouldable at scale), (3) conduct a broader user needs survey including outdoor use scenarios. This iterative approach aligns with commercial product development, where first prototypes inform specification revision before production.*

### Secondary concept: Iterative Design Process (DT-KS4-C002)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

The iterative design process is a cyclical model of design activity in which design ideas are repeatedly generated, tested, evaluated and refined through multiple cycles until an effective design solution is achieved. Unlike the linear design model (brief → research → idea → prototype → evaluation), the iterative model acknowledges that design problems are not fully understood at the outset, that evaluation at any stage may require returning to earlier stages, and that prototyping and testing are integral to the development of ideas rather than merely their verification. At GCSE, the iterative design process is reflected in the non-examined assessment, which requires pupils to document the development of their design through multiple iterations.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Understands that design is a process of developing ideas to solve a problem, and can sketch initial design ideas with basic annotations. | Drawing only one idea rather than generating a range of alternatives; Sketching without any annotation about materials, dimensions, or how the design works |
| **Developing** | Follows a structured iterative design process: research, specification, ideation, development, making, testing, evaluation. Uses modelling and prototyping to refine ideas before final making. | Going straight to final material without modelling, leading to expensive mistakes; Treating modelling as a one-off activity rather than an iterative cycle of test-modify-retest |
| **Secure** | Manages the full design cycle independently, using research to inform the specification, systematic ideation techniques (morphological analysis, SCAMPER), controlled testing against specification, and evidence-based design decisions at each iteration. | Using morphological charts to generate combinations without then evaluating them against the specification; Selecting a final design based on personal preference rather than evidence from testing and user feedback |
| **Mastery** | Critically analyses the iterative design process as used in industry, evaluates design methodologies (user-centred design, design thinking, agile), and reflects on how constraints (time, cost, regulation, sustainability) shape the design outcome. | Treating user-centred design and technology-push as mutually exclusive rather than complementary; Not recognising that iterative design has diminishing returns — at some point, further iteration costs more than the improvement it delivers |

### Secondary concept: Sustainability and Responsible Design (DT-KS4-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Sustainability in design and technology refers to the practice of creating products, processes and systems that meet present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable design considers the full lifecycle of a product from raw material extraction through processing, manufacturing, distribution, use and end-of-life disposal, assessing and minimising environmental impact at each stage. Key concepts include: circular economy (designing for reuse, repair and recycling rather than disposal); material efficiency (using the minimum material necessary); energy efficiency in use; ethical sourcing (ensuring that materials and manufacturing processes do not exploit workers or damage communities); and biomimicry (learning from natural systems to create more sustainable designs).

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Recognises that products should be designed to minimise waste and environmental harm, and can name basic sustainable practices such as recycling and using less material. | Only mentioning recycling and not considering reducing material use or designing for longevity; Assuming that 'natural' materials are always more sustainable than synthetic ones without evidence |
| **Developing** | Applies the 6 Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle, refuse, rethink, repair) to design decisions, understands planned obsolescence, and selects materials and processes with lower environmental impact. | Confusing planned obsolescence (deliberate) with natural wear (inevitable material degradation); Proposing recycling as the primary solution rather than designing for longevity, which has lower environmental impact |
| **Secure** | Analyses the environmental impact of design decisions across the full product lifecycle, evaluates trade-offs between sustainability, cost, and performance, and applies circular economy principles to design. | Recommending bioplastics as universally better than conventional plastics without considering composting infrastructure and cross-contamination; Evaluating only production impact and not considering end-of-life — the most recyclable material is only sustainable if it is actually recycled |
| **Mastery** | Critically evaluates systemic approaches to sustainable design including cradle-to-cradle thinking, circular economy business models, and the tension between consumer demand and planetary boundaries. Proposes design interventions at both product and system levels. | Presenting the circular economy as a complete solution to environmental problems without acknowledging thermodynamic degradation limits; Focusing only on product-level design changes without addressing the system-level changes (business models, infrastructure, policy) needed to close material loops |

## Thinking lens: Stability and Change (primary)

**Key question:** What keeps this stable, what causes change, and how quickly does change happen?

**Why this lens fits:** Sustainability is fundamentally a stability question: responsible design asks whether a material or production system can remain viable over time without depleting resources or causing irreversible environmental change — the cluster demands reasoning about long-run system stability.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- Under what conditions does this equilibrium shift, and can you quantify the change?
- How do positive and negative feedback loops affect the stability of this system?
- Is this system in static or dynamic equilibrium, and what is the difference here?
- How predictable is this change, and what makes it more or less certain?

**Secondary lens:** Perspective and Interpretation — Responsible design in social and cultural context requires pupils to evaluate design choices from the perspectives of different affected communities — a product designed in the global north may have very different implications when viewed from the perspective of the communities that mine its materials.

## Session structure: Comparison Study

### Comparison Study
A structured comparison of two or more examples, places, periods, or perspectives. Introduces each example with sufficient context, applies a systematic comparison framework, analyses similarities and differences with supporting evidence, and reaches an evaluative conclusion about the significance of those differences.

`introduce_examples` → `systematic_comparison` → `analysis` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Comparative analysis using a structured framework (table, Venn diagram, or essay), demonstrating understanding of both examples and reaching a substantiated evaluative conclusion.

**Teacher note:** Use the COMPARISON STUDY template: frame the comparison within a theoretical or conceptual framework. Expect independent identification of appropriate criteria and rigorous analysis using subject-specific terminology. Demand an evaluative conclusion that assesses the extent of similarity or difference and its significance, considering limitations of the comparative method itself.

**KS4 question stems:**
- What theoretical framework underpins your choice of comparison criteria?
- To what extent do the similarities outweigh the differences, and what does this suggest?
- What are the limitations of comparing these two cases?
- How would you construct a sustained evaluative argument from this comparison?

## Design and Technology: Design In Context

**Design brief:** Research two influential designers from different eras or movements. Analyse how their social, cultural and technological context shaped their design philosophy and products. Create a comparative presentation and design a product that shows the influence of one of these designers on your own work.

**Materials:** research resources, presentation materials, sketching materials for design response
**Tools:** research resources (books, online archives, museum websites), presentation software, sketching and rendering materials
**Techniques:** design analysis (form, function, materials, manufacture, context), comparative analysis across eras, design sketching in the style of an influential designer, presentation and communication of design ideas
**Safety notes:** No specific workshop safety requirements for this research-based unit.

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Is the analysis of each designer thorough and contextualised?
- Does the comparison identify meaningful similarities and differences?
- Does the design response show genuine influence from the studied designer?
- Is the presentation clear and well-evidenced?

## Why this study matters

Understanding the history of design is a mandatory exam topic. Studying influential designers (William Morris, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Harry Beck, Philippe Starck, Dieter Rams, James Dyson) and movements (Arts and Crafts, Bauhaus, Art Deco, Memphis, Modernism) teaches that design does not exist in a cultural vacuum. Each designer's work reflects the social, technological and economic context of their era. Connecting historical analysis to contemporary design helps pupils develop an informed design identity.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Treating design history as a list of names and dates -- connect each designer to their design philosophy and its influence
2. Only covering Western designers -- include global design traditions and contemporary non-Western designers
3. Not connecting to pupils' own designing -- ask 'how does this influence YOUR design decisions?'
