## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Sustainability and Responsible Design (DT-KS4-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Sustainability in design and technology refers to the practice of creating products, processes and systems that meet present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable design considers the full lifecycle of a product from raw material extraction through processing, manufacturing, distribution, use and end-of-life disposal, assessing and minimising environmental impact at each stage. Key concepts include: circular economy (designing for reuse, repair and recycling rather than disposal); material efficiency (using the minimum material necessary); energy efficiency in use; ethical sourcing (ensuring that materials and manufacturing processes do not exploit workers or damage communities); and biomimicry (learning from natural systems to create more sustainable designs).

**Teaching guidance:** Develop lifecycle thinking through product lifecycle analysis exercises: map the full journey of a familiar product from raw materials to disposal, identifying environmental impacts at each stage. Introduce the six Rs of sustainability (Rethink, Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repair, Recycle) as a framework for evaluating design decisions. Study specific examples of sustainable design innovation: the circular economy in practice; cradle-to-cradle design; bioplastics. Connect sustainability to economic and social dimensions: fair trade certification; ethical manufacturing standards; community impact. For examination questions, practise evaluating specific design decisions against sustainability criteria, making justified judgements about their relative environmental and social impact.

**Key vocabulary:** sustainability, lifecycle, circular economy, carbon footprint, cradle to cradle, fair trade, ethical, biodegradable, recyclability, energy efficiency, biomimicry, planned obsolescence, material efficiency, carbon neutral, ecological footprint

**Common misconceptions:** The reduction of sustainability to 'using recycled materials' or 'being green' obscures the systemic and lifecycle dimensions of genuine sustainable design thinking. Pupils may believe that individual consumer choices are the primary driver of sustainability, rather than systemic design decisions made at the product and system level. The concept of planned obsolescence — deliberately designing products to fail or become unfashionable quickly — may be unfamiliar; studying it is essential for understanding the relationship between business models and sustainability outcomes.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Recognises that products should be designed to minimise waste and environmental harm, and can name basic sustainable practices such as recycling and using less material. | Give two ways a designer can make a product more environmentally friendly. | Only mentioning recycling and not considering reducing material use or designing for longevity; Assuming that 'natural' materials are always more sustainable than synthetic ones without evidence |
| **Developing** | Applies the 6 Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle, refuse, rethink, repair) to design decisions, understands planned obsolescence, and selects materials and processes with lower environmental impact. | Explain how planned obsolescence affects sustainability and describe two design strategies to counter it. | Confusing planned obsolescence (deliberate) with natural wear (inevitable material degradation); Proposing recycling as the primary solution rather than designing for longevity, which has lower environmental impact |
| **Secure** | Analyses the environmental impact of design decisions across the full product lifecycle, evaluates trade-offs between sustainability, cost, and performance, and applies circular economy principles to design. | A company wants to replace single-use plastic food packaging. Evaluate three alternative materials and recommend one, considering the full lifecycle. | Recommending bioplastics as universally better than conventional plastics without considering composting infrastructure and cross-contamination; Evaluating only production impact and not considering end-of-life — the most recyclable material is only sustainable if it is actually recycled |
| **Mastery** | Critically evaluates systemic approaches to sustainable design including cradle-to-cradle thinking, circular economy business models, and the tension between consumer demand and planetary boundaries. Proposes design interventions at both product and system levels. | Evaluate the circular economy model compared to the traditional linear economy. Discuss the role of designers in enabling the transition and identify the limitations of circular design. | Presenting the circular economy as a complete solution to environmental problems without acknowledging thermodynamic degradation limits; Focusing only on product-level design changes without addressing the system-level changes (business models, infrastructure, policy) needed to close material loops |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Use recycled materials instead of virgin materials, and design the product to be taken apart at the end of its life so parts can be recycled or reused.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Planned obsolescence is designing products to fail or become unfashionable after a set period, encouraging consumers to buy replacements. This increases waste and resource consumption. Counter-strategies: (1) Design for repair — use standard fasteners (screws not glue), make components accessible, and publish repair guides. Fairphone does this with modular smartphone components. (2) Design for upgradability — allow key components (battery, processor) to be upgraded without replacing the whole product, extending its useful life.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Option 1: Cardboard — renewable, biodegradable, recyclable. But poor moisture barrier requires wax or plastic lining, complicating recycling. Works for dry foods. Option 2: PLA bioplastic — made from corn starch, industrially compostable. But requires industrial composting facilities (not widely available), contaminates plastic recycling streams, and corn farming has significant land/water use. Option 3: Aluminium — infinitely recyclable with 95% energy saving vs virgin production, excellent barrier properties. But high energy cost for initial production and heavier than plastic (transport emissions). Recommendation: aluminium for products where the packaging is likely to be recycled (cans, trays) — the high recyclability and infinite recyclability outweigh the initial energy cost if recycling infrastructure exists. For single-serve items where recycling is unlikely, cardboard with a water-based barrier coating is the lowest-impact option.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *The linear economy (take-make-dispose) treats resources as infinite and externalises waste costs. The circular economy aims to eliminate waste by designing products as part of closed loops: biological materials return to the biosphere, technical materials circulate through reuse, repair, remanufacture, and recycling. Designers are critical enablers: material selection (mono-materials over composites for recyclability), modular construction (replaceable components), standardised interfaces (interoperability), and material passports (tracking composition for future recovery). However, limitations exist: circular systems require new business models (product-as-service), consumer behaviour change (returning products, accepting remanufactured goods), and reverse logistics infrastructure. Thermodynamic limits mean materials degrade with each recycling loop — truly 'infinite' cycling is physically impossible. Some critics argue that circular economy thinking provides comforting illusions of sustainability while consumption volumes continue to rise. Genuine sustainability may require 'sufficiency' — designing to produce and consume less, not just more efficiently — a politically challenging but physically necessary position.*

### Secondary concept: Life Cycle Analysis and Sustainability Evaluation (DT-KS4-C007)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Life cycle analysis (LCA) is a systematic method for assessing the environmental impact of a product across its entire life — from raw material extraction through processing, manufacturing, distribution, use and end-of-life disposal or recycling. LCA reveals the full environmental cost of a product's existence, including energy use, water use, emissions and waste at each stage. At GCSE, pupils use LCA as an evaluation framework to assess the environmental performance of existing products and their own designs, making justified judgements about the relative sustainability of different design decisions.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Recognises that products have an environmental impact and that materials can sometimes be recycled. Identifies basic stages of a product's life. | Omitting the raw material extraction or transportation stages; Assuming all plastic is recycled when in reality a significant proportion goes to landfill |
| **Developing** | Describes life cycle assessment (LCA) as a method for evaluating environmental impact at each stage: raw material extraction, manufacture, use, and disposal. Identifies the environmental impact of each stage. | Assuming 'natural' materials like cotton automatically have lower environmental impact than synthetic alternatives; Ignoring the use phase — how frequently and how long a product is used significantly affects its total impact |
| **Secure** | Compares LCAs for alternative products or materials, uses quantitative data where available, and evaluates trade-offs between environmental, economic, and social factors. Understands the 6 Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle, refuse, rethink, repair). | Concluding that the 'most natural' option is automatically the most sustainable without comparing per-use impact data; Not considering realistic consumer behaviour — how many times will the bag actually be reused? |
| **Mastery** | Critically evaluates the limitations of LCA methodology, analyses circular economy principles, and proposes design strategies that minimise environmental impact across the full product lifecycle including end-of-life. | Treating LCA results as objective facts rather than recognising the methodological choices and value judgements embedded in them; Proposing 'design for recycling' without considering that recycling itself has environmental costs and material degradation limits |

## Thinking lens: Evidence and Argument (primary)

**Key question:** What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?

**Why this lens fits:** Formal evaluation against a product specification is a structured evidence-argument task: pupils must identify specific criteria, gather evidence (measurements, user tests, material data) and argue the extent to which each criterion has been met.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- How does the methodology affect the strength of this evidence?
- Is this argument logically valid, regardless of whether you agree with the conclusion?
- What logical fallacy, if any, weakens this argument?
- How would you weigh these competing bodies of evidence to reach a justified conclusion?

**Secondary lens:** Stability and Change — Sustainability is fundamentally a stability question: responsible design asks whether a material or production system can remain viable over time without depleting resources or causing irreversible environmental change — the cluster demands reasoning about long-run system stability.

## Session structure: Research Enquiry

### Research Enquiry
A structured approach to answering questions through secondary research. Pupils formulate a research question, select appropriate sources, take and organise notes, synthesise findings from multiple sources, and present their conclusions. Develops information literacy alongside subject knowledge.

`question` → `source_selection` → `note_taking` → `synthesis` → `presentation`

**Assessment:** Research report or presentation that answers the original question using evidence from multiple sources, with evaluation of source reliability where appropriate.

**Teacher note:** Use the RESEARCH ENQUIRY template: set a complex research question requiring independent source selection and critical evaluation. Expect pupils to assess methodology and bias in secondary sources, cross-reference findings, identify gaps in the evidence base, and produce a well-structured synthesis that acknowledges uncertainty and competing claims.

**KS4 question stems:**
- What methodological strengths and weaknesses do your key sources have?
- What gaps exist in the available evidence, and how do they affect your conclusions?
- How would you resolve contradictions between your sources?
- How does your synthesis address competing claims and acknowledge uncertainty?

## Design and Technology: Sustainability

**Design brief:** Conduct a full Life Cycle Assessment of a common consumer product. Compare it to a more sustainable alternative. Present your findings as a visual report with data, diagrams, and recommendations for designers. Apply the 6Rs framework to propose improvements.

**Materials:** product samples for analysis, LCA data resources, presentation materials
**Tools:** research resources (LCA databases, manufacturer data), presentation software, calculator for carbon footprint estimation
**Techniques:** life cycle assessment methodology, carbon footprint calculation, comparative analysis, data presentation and visualisation, design recommendations based on evidence
**Safety notes:** Product disassembly (if conducted): teacher-supervised. Do not disassemble products containing batteries, capacitors or pressurised components. Wear gloves when handling products with unknown chemical treatments.

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Is the LCA thorough and evidence-based?
- Does the comparison identify genuine environmental trade-offs?
- Are the 6Rs applied meaningfully?
- Are the design recommendations specific and actionable?

## Why this study matters

Sustainability is a mandatory exam topic. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) provides a systematic framework for evaluating environmental impact from raw material extraction through manufacture, use and disposal. Pupils conduct an LCA of a common product (a plastic water bottle, a cotton T-shirt, a smartphone), comparing it to a sustainable alternative. This develops analytical skills required for the exam and connects DT to geography, science and citizenship.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. LCA reduced to a simple 'good vs bad' judgement -- the analysis must be nuanced (trade-offs between environmental impacts)
2. Ignoring the use phase -- for many products, the use phase (energy, water) has more impact than manufacture
3. Not connecting to the 6Rs framework -- reduce, reuse, recycle, refuse, rethink, repair
