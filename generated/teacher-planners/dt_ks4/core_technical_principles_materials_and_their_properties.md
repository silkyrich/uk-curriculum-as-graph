## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Material Properties and Selection (DT-KS4-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Material properties are the specific physical, mechanical, electrical, thermal and aesthetic characteristics that determine how a material behaves and what it can appropriately be used for. Physical properties include density, hardness, strength, elasticity and malleability. Mechanical properties include stiffness, toughness and compressive and tensile strength. Thermal properties include conductivity and resistance. Electrical properties include conductivity and resistance. Aesthetic properties include texture, colour, translucency and surface quality. Material selection requires matching the properties of available materials to the specific demands of a design brief, considering also cost, availability, environmental impact, and the manufacturing processes required to work with the material.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach material properties through practical investigation: test the strength, flexibility and workability of materials rather than simply listing properties. Develop a systematic framework for material comparison: physical, mechanical, thermal, electrical, aesthetic, environmental, economic. Set material selection tasks where pupils must justify their choice with reference to specific property requirements. Practise examination questions that ask pupils to explain why a specific material is or is not suitable for a given application: focus on the match between required and actual properties. Develop understanding of how materials are modified and enhanced through finishing processes (painting, varnishing, plating, anodising, laminating) and how this affects their properties.

**Key vocabulary:** density, hardness, tensile strength, compressive strength, elasticity, malleability, ductility, thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, corrosion resistance, aesthetics, composite, alloy, polymer, timber

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils frequently confuse 'hardness' (resistance to scratching) with 'strength' (resistance to force); teaching the precise definition of each property and its testing method clarifies the distinction. The idea that one material is universally 'best' ignores the context-specificity of design decisions; every material selection must be justified in relation to specific requirements. Students may treat modern and smart materials as exotic curiosities rather than as materials with specific, relevant properties; connecting them to real design applications makes their relevance concrete.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Names common materials (wood, metal, plastic, textile) and describes basic properties such as hard, soft, flexible, rigid, waterproof. | Suggest a suitable material for a kitchen chopping board and explain your choice using material properties. | Choosing a material without linking the choice to specific required properties; Not considering food safety or hygiene when selecting materials for kitchen products |
| **Developing** | Classifies materials by type (hardwood, softwood, ferrous/non-ferrous metal, thermoforming/thermosetting polymer) and selects materials based on multiple properties including mechanical, physical, and working characteristics. | A bicycle frame needs to be lightweight, strong, and corrosion-resistant. Compare aluminium alloy and mild steel for this application. | Comparing only one property (e.g. strength) without considering the full range of requirements; Not recognising that strength-to-weight ratio matters more than absolute strength for weight-critical applications |
| **Secure** | Analyses material properties quantitatively using data sheets, understands how material structure affects properties (grain structure, polymer chains, alloy composition), and selects materials with justified trade-offs for specific design contexts. | A designer is choosing between acrylic (PMMA) and polycarbonate for safety glasses. Use material property data to justify the selection. | Selecting materials on a single headline property without checking that other critical requirements are met; Not linking macroscopic properties (impact resistance) to material microstructure (polymer chain flexibility) |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates material selection in the context of full product lifecycle including processing, cost, supply chain, environmental impact, and emerging materials. Analyses how smart and modern materials extend the design palette. | Evaluate the use of carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) versus aluminium alloy for a high-performance racing bicycle frame. Consider performance, manufacture, cost, repairability, and end-of-life. | Concluding that the highest-performing material is always the best choice without considering manufacture, cost, and sustainability; Not recognising that CFRP's end-of-life limitations are a significant sustainability concern that affects design decisions |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Hardwood such as beech would be suitable because it is hard-wearing, resistant to cuts, food-safe, and has natural antibacterial properties. It is also rigid enough not to flex during use.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Aluminium alloy: density ~2,700 kg/m³ (lightweight), good strength-to-weight ratio, naturally corrosion-resistant due to oxide layer. Mild steel: density ~7,850 kg/m³ (nearly three times heavier), higher tensile strength per unit area, but corrodes without protective coating (paint or galvanising). For a bicycle frame, aluminium alloy is more suitable because weight reduction is critical for performance, and it requires less surface treatment. However, mild steel is cheaper and easier to weld, making it suitable for budget frames.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Acrylic: tensile strength 70 MPa, good optical clarity (92% light transmission), rigid, but brittle — shatters on impact. Polycarbonate: tensile strength 55-75 MPa, good optical clarity (88% transmission), but critically has very high impact resistance (250 times greater than glass). For safety glasses, polycarbonate is essential because the primary requirement is impact protection. The slight reduction in optical clarity is acceptable given the massive gain in impact resistance. Acrylic would be suitable for display cases where impact is not a concern and maximum clarity is desired. The difference lies in polymer chain structure: polycarbonate's long, flexible chains absorb impact energy through deformation; acrylic's rigid chains fracture.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Performance: CFRP offers superior stiffness-to-weight ratio (specific modulus ~190 GPa/(g/cm³) vs aluminium's ~26). Manufacture: CFRP requires hand lay-up or autoclave moulding — expensive, labour-intensive, with high tooling costs. Aluminium is extruded and welded — faster, cheaper, and more automated. Cost: a CFRP frame costs 3-10x more than aluminium. Repairability: CFRP damage (delamination) is often invisible and difficult to repair safely; aluminium can be welded. End-of-life: aluminium is infinitely recyclable with established infrastructure. CFRP recycling is technologically immature — most ends in landfill, and recycled carbon fibre has reduced properties. For elite racing, CFRP's performance advantage justifies the cost and environmental trade-offs. For mass-market cycling, aluminium remains more responsible. This illustrates how 'best material' depends on the design context, not just material properties in isolation.*

### Secondary concept: Sustainability and Responsible Design (DT-KS4-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Sustainability in design and technology refers to the practice of creating products, processes and systems that meet present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable design considers the full lifecycle of a product from raw material extraction through processing, manufacturing, distribution, use and end-of-life disposal, assessing and minimising environmental impact at each stage. Key concepts include: circular economy (designing for reuse, repair and recycling rather than disposal); material efficiency (using the minimum material necessary); energy efficiency in use; ethical sourcing (ensuring that materials and manufacturing processes do not exploit workers or damage communities); and biomimicry (learning from natural systems to create more sustainable designs).

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Recognises that products should be designed to minimise waste and environmental harm, and can name basic sustainable practices such as recycling and using less material. | Only mentioning recycling and not considering reducing material use or designing for longevity; Assuming that 'natural' materials are always more sustainable than synthetic ones without evidence |
| **Developing** | Applies the 6 Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle, refuse, rethink, repair) to design decisions, understands planned obsolescence, and selects materials and processes with lower environmental impact. | Confusing planned obsolescence (deliberate) with natural wear (inevitable material degradation); Proposing recycling as the primary solution rather than designing for longevity, which has lower environmental impact |
| **Secure** | Analyses the environmental impact of design decisions across the full product lifecycle, evaluates trade-offs between sustainability, cost, and performance, and applies circular economy principles to design. | Recommending bioplastics as universally better than conventional plastics without considering composting infrastructure and cross-contamination; Evaluating only production impact and not considering end-of-life — the most recyclable material is only sustainable if it is actually recycled |
| **Mastery** | Critically evaluates systemic approaches to sustainable design including cradle-to-cradle thinking, circular economy business models, and the tension between consumer demand and planetary boundaries. Proposes design interventions at both product and system levels. | Presenting the circular economy as a complete solution to environmental problems without acknowledging thermodynamic degradation limits; Focusing only on product-level design changes without addressing the system-level changes (business models, infrastructure, policy) needed to close material loops |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** GCSE material selection requires pupils to rigorously match a material's structural properties (tensile strength, malleability, thermal conductivity) to the functional demands of a product specification — every selection decision is a structure-function argument.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- How do structural features at different scales interact to produce this function?
- What structural constraints limit what this system can do?
- Why have unrelated organisms evolved similar structures for similar functions?
- How would you apply structure-function analysis to improve this design?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Justifying material selection in GCSE examinations requires a structured argument: a candidate must state which material property meets which design requirement and cite evidence (material data, test results) to support the choice.

## Session structure: Research Enquiry

### Research Enquiry
A structured approach to answering questions through secondary research. Pupils formulate a research question, select appropriate sources, take and organise notes, synthesise findings from multiple sources, and present their conclusions. Develops information literacy alongside subject knowledge.

`question` → `source_selection` → `note_taking` → `synthesis` → `presentation`

**Assessment:** Research report or presentation that answers the original question using evidence from multiple sources, with evaluation of source reliability where appropriate.

**Teacher note:** Use the RESEARCH ENQUIRY template: set a complex research question requiring independent source selection and critical evaluation. Expect pupils to assess methodology and bias in secondary sources, cross-reference findings, identify gaps in the evidence base, and produce a well-structured synthesis that acknowledges uncertainty and competing claims.

**KS4 question stems:**
- What methodological strengths and weaknesses do your key sources have?
- What gaps exist in the available evidence, and how do they affect your conclusions?
- How would you resolve contradictions between your sources?
- How does your synthesis address competing claims and acknowledge uncertainty?

## Design and Technology: Core Technical Principles

**Design brief:** Investigate the properties of materials across all six categories (timber, metals and alloys, polymers, textiles, papers and boards, electronic/mechanical systems). Conduct practical tests to compare properties. Create a materials reference portfolio including modern and smart materials with application case studies.

**Materials:** material samples across all categories, test specimens (standard sizes for fair testing), smart material samples (thermochromic sheet, nitinol wire)
**Tools:** tensile testing apparatus (if available) or spring balance test rig, Mohs hardness test materials, digital callipers, thermometers, multimeters
**Techniques:** tensile testing, hardness comparison, thermal conductivity testing, material identification from properties, research and documentation of smart materials
**Safety notes:** Material testing: safety glasses for tensile tests (samples may snap). Nitinol wire: use tongs when heating (shape recovery is triggered by heat). Thermochromic materials: heat source required -- use hot water, not direct flame. Standard PPE for any workshop activity.

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Can you identify materials from their properties?
- Can you explain why specific materials are suited to specific applications?
- Is the materials portfolio comprehensive and accurate?
- Can you describe the properties and applications of at least three smart materials?

## Why this study matters

Understanding material properties is the foundation of all GCSE DT decisions. Pupils must know the physical (density, hardness), mechanical (tensile strength, toughness, elasticity), thermal and electrical properties of six material categories. Testing materials through practical investigation (tensile testing, hardness testing, thermal conductivity experiments) makes abstract properties concrete and memorable. Smart materials (thermochromic inks, shape-memory alloys, piezoelectric materials) connect to industry innovation.

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Memorising properties without understanding application -- always connect properties to 'why would a designer choose this material?'
2. Confusing strength with hardness or toughness -- teach the precise engineering definitions through practical tests
3. Neglecting modern and smart materials -- these appear frequently in exam questions
