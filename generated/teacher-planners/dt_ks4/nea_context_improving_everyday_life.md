## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **3 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Iterative Design Process (DT-KS4-C002)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

The iterative design process is a cyclical model of design activity in which design ideas are repeatedly generated, tested, evaluated and refined through multiple cycles until an effective design solution is achieved. Unlike the linear design model (brief → research → idea → prototype → evaluation), the iterative model acknowledges that design problems are not fully understood at the outset, that evaluation at any stage may require returning to earlier stages, and that prototyping and testing are integral to the development of ideas rather than merely their verification. At GCSE, the iterative design process is reflected in the non-examined assessment, which requires pupils to document the development of their design through multiple iterations.

**Teaching guidance:** Model the iterative design process explicitly: show pupils examples of real design development in which early ideas are substantially revised in response to testing and evaluation. Require pupils to produce and evaluate multiple design iterations rather than moving directly from initial idea to final prototype. Develop reflective evaluation habits: after each iteration, what worked? What did not? What needs to change? Connect iteration to the broader design process: how does testing a prototype inform the next design iteration? For examination questions about design process, practise structuring responses that show understanding of iteration as a design method rather than simply a sequence of steps.

**Key vocabulary:** iterative, design cycle, prototype, testing, evaluation, feedback, refinement, specification, brief, research, development, CAD, modelling, user testing, iteration

**Common misconceptions:** Many pupils think of the design process as a linear sequence of steps, not understanding that effective design requires returning to earlier stages as new information emerges. The concept of 'failure' in prototyping is often misunderstood; a prototype that reveals a problem has succeeded as a testing tool, even if it fails as a product. Students may conflate the school assessment submission (a record of work done) with the design process itself; the process and its documentation are different things.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Understands that design is a process of developing ideas to solve a problem, and can sketch initial design ideas with basic annotations. | Sketch three different ideas for a phone holder that sits on a desk. Annotate each with materials and one key feature. | Drawing only one idea rather than generating a range of alternatives; Sketching without any annotation about materials, dimensions, or how the design works |
| **Developing** | Follows a structured iterative design process: research, specification, ideation, development, making, testing, evaluation. Uses modelling and prototyping to refine ideas before final making. | Describe how you would use modelling to develop your phone holder design before making the final product. | Going straight to final material without modelling, leading to expensive mistakes; Treating modelling as a one-off activity rather than an iterative cycle of test-modify-retest |
| **Secure** | Manages the full design cycle independently, using research to inform the specification, systematic ideation techniques (morphological analysis, SCAMPER), controlled testing against specification, and evidence-based design decisions at each iteration. | Explain how you would use a morphological chart to generate design ideas for a portable reading light, then narrow down to a final concept. | Using morphological charts to generate combinations without then evaluating them against the specification; Selecting a final design based on personal preference rather than evidence from testing and user feedback |
| **Mastery** | Critically analyses the iterative design process as used in industry, evaluates design methodologies (user-centred design, design thinking, agile), and reflects on how constraints (time, cost, regulation, sustainability) shape the design outcome. | Compare user-centred design with technology-push approaches. Use a specific product example to evaluate which approach leads to better outcomes and why. | Treating user-centred design and technology-push as mutually exclusive rather than complementary; Not recognising that iterative design has diminishing returns — at some point, further iteration costs more than the improvement it delivers |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Idea 1: L-shaped acrylic stand with a groove for the phone — simple, clear, can see screen. Idea 2: Wooden cradle with adjustable angle — more comfortable viewing but more complex to make. Idea 3: Wire frame holder bent from steel rod — lightweight and modern-looking but may scratch the phone.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *I would first make a card model to test the proportions and viewing angle — card is quick and cheap to work with. I would test it with different phone sizes to check compatibility. Based on feedback, I would modify the dimensions and then make a 3D-printed prototype in PLA to test structural integrity under load. This iterative process — model, test, modify — means the final version in acrylic is more likely to succeed first time, saving material and workshop time.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *I would create a morphological chart with parameters: power source (battery, USB, solar), light type (LED strip, single LED, panel), housing material (3D-printed PLA, bent aluminium, laser-cut plywood), clip mechanism (spring clip, magnetic, weighted base), and switch type (toggle, touch sensor, twist). By combining one option from each row, I can systematically generate diverse concepts — e.g. solar-powered LED panel in bent aluminium with magnetic mount and touch sensor. I would evaluate each combination against my specification (portability weight < 100g, brightness > 200 lumens, cost < £5 materials) and select the top three for quick card modelling. User feedback on the models would determine the final concept.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *User-centred design (UCD) starts with user needs: research (interviews, observation), define (personas, specification), ideate, prototype, test with users, iterate. Technology-push starts with a new capability and finds applications. Example — Dyson vacuum cleaners: the original DC01 was technology-push (cyclone separation applied to vacuum cleaning). However, subsequent models used UCD — testing showed users wanted lighter weight, better manoeuvrability, and easier bin emptying, which drove the shift to ball technology and cordless designs. Neither approach is universally better: technology-push creates breakthrough innovations (no user would have asked for cyclone separation), but UCD ensures the product actually solves real problems and is usable. The most successful products combine both — a novel technology refined through iterative user testing. The design process itself is a design decision that should be matched to the context.*

### Secondary concept: Material Properties and Selection (DT-KS4-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Material properties are the specific physical, mechanical, electrical, thermal and aesthetic characteristics that determine how a material behaves and what it can appropriately be used for. Physical properties include density, hardness, strength, elasticity and malleability. Mechanical properties include stiffness, toughness and compressive and tensile strength. Thermal properties include conductivity and resistance. Electrical properties include conductivity and resistance. Aesthetic properties include texture, colour, translucency and surface quality. Material selection requires matching the properties of available materials to the specific demands of a design brief, considering also cost, availability, environmental impact, and the manufacturing processes required to work with the material.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Names common materials (wood, metal, plastic, textile) and describes basic properties such as hard, soft, flexible, rigid, waterproof. | Choosing a material without linking the choice to specific required properties; Not considering food safety or hygiene when selecting materials for kitchen products |
| **Developing** | Classifies materials by type (hardwood, softwood, ferrous/non-ferrous metal, thermoforming/thermosetting polymer) and selects materials based on multiple properties including mechanical, physical, and working characteristics. | Comparing only one property (e.g. strength) without considering the full range of requirements; Not recognising that strength-to-weight ratio matters more than absolute strength for weight-critical applications |
| **Secure** | Analyses material properties quantitatively using data sheets, understands how material structure affects properties (grain structure, polymer chains, alloy composition), and selects materials with justified trade-offs for specific design contexts. | Selecting materials on a single headline property without checking that other critical requirements are met; Not linking macroscopic properties (impact resistance) to material microstructure (polymer chain flexibility) |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates material selection in the context of full product lifecycle including processing, cost, supply chain, environmental impact, and emerging materials. Analyses how smart and modern materials extend the design palette. | Concluding that the highest-performing material is always the best choice without considering manufacture, cost, and sustainability; Not recognising that CFRP's end-of-life limitations are a significant sustainability concern that affects design decisions |

### Secondary concept: Human Factors, Ergonomics and Inclusive Design (DT-KS4-C003)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Human factors is the study of how people interact with designed objects and systems, with the aim of optimising that interaction for safety, comfort, efficiency and effectiveness. Ergonomics applies human factors knowledge to the design of products: ensuring that objects fit the human body (anthropometrics), are cognitively manageable (usability), and meet the physical, sensory and cognitive capabilities of their intended users. Inclusive design — also called universal design — extends ergonomic thinking to ensure that products are usable by the widest possible range of people, including those with disabilities, across the full age range and in diverse cultural contexts.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Recognises that products should be designed for people of different sizes and abilities, and that comfort and ease of use are important design considerations. | Assuming that designing for the 'average' person works for everyone; Not considering that comfort affects concentration and learning, not just physical wellbeing |
| **Developing** | Uses anthropometric data (body measurements) to inform design decisions, understands the concept of percentile ranges (5th to 95th), and applies basic ergonomic principles to ensure products fit the user. | Designing for the 50th percentile (average) rather than the 5th-95th percentile range; Using anthropometric data for one population group and applying it universally without considering diversity |
| **Secure** | Applies ergonomic principles (posture, grip, reach, force) and anthropometric data to specific design contexts. Considers inclusive design for users with a range of abilities, ages, and physical characteristics. | Designing for disability as a separate 'special' category rather than applying inclusive principles that benefit all users; Specifying ergonomic features without justifying them with specific data about user capabilities |
| **Mastery** | Critically evaluates how human factors research informs commercial product design, analyses the tension between inclusive design and market segmentation, and proposes design strategies that balance ergonomic optimisation with manufacturing and commercial constraints. | Accepting user exclusion as inevitable without exploring adjustable or adaptive design solutions; Not recognising that inclusive design often drives innovation that benefits all users, not just those with specific needs |

### Secondary concept: Evaluation Against Specification and User Needs (DT-KS4-C006)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Formal evaluation at GCSE involves systematically assessing a design outcome against both the original specification — the measurable criteria derived from the design brief — and the needs of the intended user. Effective evaluation is evidence-based: outcomes are tested against objective criteria rather than assessed through personal opinion. Methods include physical testing (does it meet strength, size, weight or capacity requirements?), user testing (does the intended user find it usable, comfortable and appealing?), and comparative analysis (how does it compare to existing products that address the same brief?). Evaluation findings are used to make justified recommendations for further development.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Identifies basic evaluation criteria such as whether a product works and whether it looks finished. Can state simple likes and dislikes about a product. | Giving vague opinions ('it's good') without linking to specific functional or aesthetic criteria; Only evaluating appearance and ignoring whether the product meets its functional purpose |
| **Developing** | Evaluates a product against its original design specification point by point, using testing evidence and user feedback to support judgements. | Evaluating generally without referring back to specific specification points; Stating a specification is 'met' without providing measurable evidence or test data |
| **Secure** | Conducts systematic evaluation using quantitative testing data, user trials, and comparison with existing commercial products. Proposes specific, justified modifications and considers manufacture at scale. | Proposing modifications without considering cost, manufacturability, or material implications; Comparing with commercial products on appearance only rather than on performance metrics |
| **Mastery** | Critically evaluates the entire design-make-evaluate cycle, analysing the effectiveness of the design process itself and not just the outcome. Considers user needs beyond the specification, commercial viability, and iterative improvement strategy. | Evaluating only the product outcome without reflecting critically on the design process decisions that led to it; Treating evaluation as a final step rather than as input to the next design iteration |

## Thinking lens: Perspective and Interpretation (primary)

**Key question:** Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?

**Why this lens fits:** Human factors and inclusive design require pupils to evaluate a product's usability from the perspective of diverse users — including those with physical, sensory or cognitive differences — making perspective-taking the central analytical demand when assessing ergonomic and accessibility criteria.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- How do power structures determine whose perspective dominates this narrative?
- What are the epistemological limits of interpreting this source?
- How would you position your interpretation within the existing historiographical debate?
- Can two contradictory interpretations both be valid? Under what conditions?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — The iterative design portfolio is an evidence-based argument: each design iteration must be justified with reference to user feedback, ergonomic data or test outcomes, and the final design must be argued as the best solution given the constraints.

---

## Session structure: Design, Make, Evaluate

### Design, Make, Evaluate
The core Design & Technology cycle. Pupils investigate existing products and user needs, design a solution with clear specifications, plan the making process, construct using appropriate materials and techniques, test against the design brief, and evaluate the outcome with suggestions for improvement.

`investigate` → `design` → `plan` → `make` → `test` → `evaluate`

**Assessment:** Design portfolio including investigation findings, annotated design with specifications, making log, test results, and evaluative conclusion comparing outcome to original brief.

**Teacher note:** Use the DESIGN, MAKE AND EVALUATE template: expect a rigorous design process including contextual research, user analysis, and iterative development. Demand detailed technical drawings, material justification, and manufacturing plans. Guide making with focus on precision, consistency, and professional finish. Evaluate critically against the brief, user feedback, manufacturing feasibility, and sustainability, connecting to exam-standard assessment criteria.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does your design respond to contextual research and user needs?
- What is the manufacturing rationale for your choice of materials and processes?
- How does the quality of your final product demonstrate precision and skill?
- How would you evaluate your product against the brief, user feedback, and sustainability criteria?

## Design and Technology: Nea Project

**Design brief:** AQA contextual challenge (changes annually): Identify a problem within the given context. Investigate the context thoroughly. Design, make and evaluate a product that addresses the identified need. The project must demonstrate iterative designing, skilled making, and rigorous evaluation against specification criteria.

**Materials:** dependent on chosen material focus area, prototype materials (card, foam board, 3D print filament), final materials as appropriate to design
**Tools:** full workshop tools as appropriate, CAD software, 3D printer and/or laser cutter, camera for documentation
**Techniques:** user research methods (interviews, questionnaires, observation), specification writing, iterative design development, prototype testing, quality control during making, evaluation against specification
**Safety notes:** Full risk assessment required for each pupil's chosen making process. All standard workshop safety rules apply. Individual risk assessments must be completed before making begins and signed by the teacher. PPE requirements depend on the chosen material focus.

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Does the investigation identify a genuine user need?
- Is the design process genuinely iterative (multiple cycles of test-evaluate-redesign)?
- Is the final product made to a high quality standard?
- Does the evaluation honestly assess the product against the original specification?

## Why this study matters

The Non-Exam Assessment (NEA) forms 50% of the GCSE grade. A context of 'improving everyday life' gives pupils maximum creative freedom to identify a genuine user need through research (interviews, questionnaires, product analysis) and design iteratively towards a resolved outcome. This exemplar walks through the complete NEA process: investigate → design → make → evaluate, demonstrating how each section maps to the mark scheme.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Choosing a product with no genuine user need -- the investigation must identify a real problem, not manufacture one
2. Iterative design on paper only -- each design iteration must be tested (card models, 3D prints, prototypes)
3. Photography missing from the making section -- document every stage; the moderator cannot visit your workshop
