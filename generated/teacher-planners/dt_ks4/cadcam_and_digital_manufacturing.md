## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: CAD/CAM and Digital Manufacturing (DT-KS4-C004)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Computer-Aided Design (CAD) refers to the use of software to create, modify, analyse and optimise design drawings and models. Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) refers to the use of computer-controlled manufacturing equipment to produce parts from digital design files. Common CAM processes include laser cutting, 3D printing (additive manufacturing), CNC milling and routing, and vinyl cutting. The integration of CAD and CAM enables rapid prototyping, design iteration and small-batch manufacture with a precision that hand manufacturing cannot match, and reflects the dominant mode of contemporary industrial design and manufacturing.

**Teaching guidance:** Develop practical competence with at least one CAD package appropriate to the material specialism. Teach the relationship between CAD file format requirements and CAM machine requirements: how does a 2D vector file become a laser cut outcome? How does a 3D model become a 3D printed part? Develop pupils' understanding of the advantages and limitations of each CAM process: laser cutting (two-dimensional; limited depth; heat-affected zone); 3D printing (slow; limited material choice; additive process); CNC milling (subtractive process; waste material; precise). For examination questions about manufacturing processes, practise comparing the suitability of different CAD/CAM processes for specific design tasks. Connect CAD/CAM to wider manufacturing: how do the same tools operate at industrial scale?

**Key vocabulary:** CAD, CAM, laser cutting, 3D printing, CNC, additive manufacturing, subtractive manufacturing, vector file, tolerance, prototype, digital fabrication, rapid prototyping, filament, toolpath, rendering

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils frequently assume that CAD/CAM replaces the need for design thinking; understanding that digital tools are a medium for implementing design decisions, not making them, is essential. The precision of digital manufacturing can give a false sense that the design is better than it is; a poorly designed object produced to high tolerance is still a poorly designed object. Students may not understand the difference between 2D and 3D CAD file formats and their applications; developing practical literacy with both develops more appropriate tool selection.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Recognises that computers can be used to design and make products, and can name basic CAD software and manufacturing equipment (3D printers, laser cutters). | Name two advantages of using CAD (computer-aided design) compared to drawing by hand. | Stating CAD is 'faster' without specifying what makes it faster (modification, duplication, sharing); Not distinguishing between CAD (design software) and CAM (manufacturing using computer-controlled machines) |
| **Developing** | Uses CAD software to create 2D and 3D designs with accurate dimensions, and understands how these designs are prepared for CAM processes such as 3D printing, laser cutting, and CNC routing. | Describe the process of designing a box joint corner in CAD and manufacturing it using a laser cutter. | Not accounting for laser kerf (material removed by the beam) when designing press-fit joints; Exporting files in the wrong format — laser cutters typically need DXF or SVG vector files, not image files |
| **Secure** | Selects appropriate CAD/CAM processes based on product requirements (material, geometry, accuracy, batch size), understands the capabilities and limitations of each process, and optimises designs for specific manufacturing methods. | Compare 3D printing (FDM) and CNC milling for producing a custom gear. Discuss accuracy, material options, and suitability for different production volumes. | Recommending 3D printing for functional parts under stress without considering anisotropic weakness between layers; Not considering that CNC is subtractive (material waste) while 3D printing is additive (minimal waste) when comparing sustainability |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates how digital manufacturing technologies are transforming industrial production, analyses the implications of Industry 4.0 (automation, IoT, digital twins), and critically assesses the environmental and social impacts of CAD/CAM in manufacturing. | Evaluate how digital manufacturing (3D printing, CNC, robotics) is changing the economics and sustainability of product manufacturing. Consider mass production versus mass customisation. | Claiming digital manufacturing will 'replace' all traditional manufacturing without recognising that mass production remains more efficient for high-volume identical products; Not considering the social impact of automation on employment alongside the technical and environmental benefits |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *CAD drawings can be easily modified without starting again, and CAD files can be sent directly to manufacturing machines like 3D printers or laser cutters for accurate production.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *In CAD (e.g. Fusion 360), I would draw the 2D profile of each face with interlocking tabs, sized to the exact material thickness (e.g. 3 mm for the plywood). I would add a kerf offset (typically 0.1-0.2 mm for laser cutting) so the joints fit snugly. The design is exported as a DXF file and imported into the laser cutter software. I would set the correct speed and power for the material, then cut. The pieces should slot together precisely due to the accurate CAD dimensions.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *FDM 3D printing: builds layer by layer in thermoplastics (PLA, ABS, nylon). Accuracy ±0.2-0.5 mm, limited by layer height and nozzle diameter. Suitable for prototyping and one-offs — no tooling cost. Limitations: visible layer lines, anisotropic strength (weak between layers), limited material range. CNC milling: subtractive process cutting from a solid block. Accuracy ±0.01-0.05 mm, smooth surface finish. Can cut metals (aluminium, steel), engineering plastics, and wood. Higher per-unit cost due to material waste and machining time, but produces stronger parts. For a prototype gear, FDM is cost-effective for testing form and fit. For a functional gear under load, CNC milling in aluminium or nylon is necessary for the required accuracy and strength.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Traditional mass production achieves low unit costs through economies of scale but requires expensive tooling (injection mould: £10,000-100,000+), limiting it to high-volume standardised products. Digital manufacturing changes the cost curve: 3D printing has zero tooling cost, making unit cost nearly constant regardless of volume. This enables mass customisation — each product can be unique (e.g. custom-fit orthotic insoles from foot scans) without cost penalty. CNC and robotic assembly with flexible programming allow rapid product changeover. However, digital manufacturing is currently slower per unit than injection moulding for large volumes. Sustainability impacts are mixed: additive manufacturing reduces material waste (vs subtractive), and localised production reduces transport emissions. But increased accessibility to manufacturing may increase consumption — the 'rebound effect.' Digital twins allow virtual testing before physical production, reducing prototype waste. The transition benefits skilled workers who can program and operate digital systems but threatens low-skill manufacturing jobs — a significant social consideration.*

### Secondary concept: Material Properties and Selection (DT-KS4-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Material properties are the specific physical, mechanical, electrical, thermal and aesthetic characteristics that determine how a material behaves and what it can appropriately be used for. Physical properties include density, hardness, strength, elasticity and malleability. Mechanical properties include stiffness, toughness and compressive and tensile strength. Thermal properties include conductivity and resistance. Electrical properties include conductivity and resistance. Aesthetic properties include texture, colour, translucency and surface quality. Material selection requires matching the properties of available materials to the specific demands of a design brief, considering also cost, availability, environmental impact, and the manufacturing processes required to work with the material.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Names common materials (wood, metal, plastic, textile) and describes basic properties such as hard, soft, flexible, rigid, waterproof. | Choosing a material without linking the choice to specific required properties; Not considering food safety or hygiene when selecting materials for kitchen products |
| **Developing** | Classifies materials by type (hardwood, softwood, ferrous/non-ferrous metal, thermoforming/thermosetting polymer) and selects materials based on multiple properties including mechanical, physical, and working characteristics. | Comparing only one property (e.g. strength) without considering the full range of requirements; Not recognising that strength-to-weight ratio matters more than absolute strength for weight-critical applications |
| **Secure** | Analyses material properties quantitatively using data sheets, understands how material structure affects properties (grain structure, polymer chains, alloy composition), and selects materials with justified trade-offs for specific design contexts. | Selecting materials on a single headline property without checking that other critical requirements are met; Not linking macroscopic properties (impact resistance) to material microstructure (polymer chain flexibility) |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates material selection in the context of full product lifecycle including processing, cost, supply chain, environmental impact, and emerging materials. Analyses how smart and modern materials extend the design palette. | Concluding that the highest-performing material is always the best choice without considering manufacture, cost, and sustainability; Not recognising that CFRP's end-of-life limitations are a significant sustainability concern that affects design decisions |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** GCSE material selection requires pupils to rigorously match a material's structural properties (tensile strength, malleability, thermal conductivity) to the functional demands of a product specification — every selection decision is a structure-function argument.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- How do structural features at different scales interact to produce this function?
- What structural constraints limit what this system can do?
- Why have unrelated organisms evolved similar structures for similar functions?
- How would you apply structure-function analysis to improve this design?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Justifying material selection in GCSE examinations requires a structured argument: a candidate must state which material property meets which design requirement and cite evidence (material data, test results) to support the choice.

## Session structure: Design, Make, Evaluate

### Design, Make, Evaluate
The core Design & Technology cycle. Pupils investigate existing products and user needs, design a solution with clear specifications, plan the making process, construct using appropriate materials and techniques, test against the design brief, and evaluate the outcome with suggestions for improvement.

`investigate` → `design` → `plan` → `make` → `test` → `evaluate`

**Assessment:** Design portfolio including investigation findings, annotated design with specifications, making log, test results, and evaluative conclusion comparing outcome to original brief.

**Teacher note:** Use the DESIGN, MAKE AND EVALUATE template: expect a rigorous design process including contextual research, user analysis, and iterative development. Demand detailed technical drawings, material justification, and manufacturing plans. Guide making with focus on precision, consistency, and professional finish. Evaluate critically against the brief, user feedback, manufacturing feasibility, and sustainability, connecting to exam-standard assessment criteria.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does your design respond to contextual research and user needs?
- What is the manufacturing rationale for your choice of materials and processes?
- How does the quality of your final product demonstrate precision and skill?
- How would you evaluate your product against the brief, user feedback, and sustainability criteria?

## Design and Technology: Cad Cam

**Design brief:** Design a product that combines at least two different digital manufacturing processes (e.g. laser-cut frame + 3D-printed components, CNC-routed base + laser-engraved surface). Document your choice of manufacturing process for each component with technical justification.

**Materials:** appropriate materials for chosen processes, PLA filament for 3D printing, plywood or acrylic for laser cutting, MDF or softwood for CNC routing
**Tools:** 2D and 3D CAD software, laser cutter (teacher operated), 3D printer, CNC router (teacher operated, if available), slicer software
**Techniques:** 2D vector drawing for laser cutting, 3D solid modelling for 3D printing, toolpath generation, combining digital and traditional manufacture, quality checking finished components
**Safety notes:** All CNC machines: teacher-operated only. Laser cutter: adequate extraction mandatory, never cut PVC. 3D printer: ensure ventilation, allow prints to cool. CNC router: hearing protection, dust extraction, no loose clothing. Always check material safety datasheets before digital manufacture.

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Are at least two digital manufacturing processes used appropriately?
- Is the choice of process technically justified?
- Are the manufactured components precise and well-finished?
- Does the final product integrate digital and traditional processes effectively?

## Why this study matters

GCSE DT requires pupils to use CAD/CAM as part of both designing and making. This unit develops competence with 2D and 3D CAD software, understanding of CNC manufacture (laser cutting, 3D printing, CNC routing), and the ability to select the most appropriate digital manufacturing process for a given design. Pupils compare digital and traditional manufacturing in terms of precision, repeatability, speed, cost and material waste.

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Using CAD/CAM as a shortcut rather than a design tool -- the design process must drive the choice of manufacture, not the other way around
2. Designing in CAD without checking physical dimensions -- always verify with real measurements
3. Not understanding manufacturing tolerances -- digital machines have limits; test cuts/prints are essential
