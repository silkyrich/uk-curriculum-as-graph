## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Evaluation Against Specification and User Needs (DT-KS4-C006)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Formal evaluation at GCSE involves systematically assessing a design outcome against both the original specification — the measurable criteria derived from the design brief — and the needs of the intended user. Effective evaluation is evidence-based: outcomes are tested against objective criteria rather than assessed through personal opinion. Methods include physical testing (does it meet strength, size, weight or capacity requirements?), user testing (does the intended user find it usable, comfortable and appealing?), and comparative analysis (how does it compare to existing products that address the same brief?). Evaluation findings are used to make justified recommendations for further development.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach pupils to distinguish between objective criteria (measurable, checkable) and subjective criteria (based on opinion and preference) in their design specifications, and to use both types in evaluation. Develop user testing protocols: how do you test a product with a real user in a structured way that produces useful feedback? Practise writing evaluation conclusions that reference specific evidence: 'The product met criterion 3 because...' rather than 'The product is good because I like it.' For examination preparation, practise structured evaluation responses that identify specific strengths and specific, justified areas for improvement. Connect evaluation back to the iterative design process: evaluation outcomes should feed into the next design iteration.

**Key vocabulary:** evaluate, specification, criterion, user need, test, evidence, objective, subjective, user feedback, strength, limitation, improvement, justify, recommend, fitness for purpose

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils frequently write evaluation that is entirely positive or is based on personal preference, rather than being referenced to the specification and user feedback. Teaching that honest evaluation of limitations is more valuable than praise — because it drives improvement — changes this. Some pupils confuse evaluation with description: saying what they made rather than assessing how well it meets its specification. The distinction between 'what I made' and 'how well it works' needs explicit teaching.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Identifies basic evaluation criteria such as whether a product works and whether it looks finished. Can state simple likes and dislikes about a product. | Look at a product you have made. State two things that work well and two things you would improve. | Giving vague opinions ('it's good') without linking to specific functional or aesthetic criteria; Only evaluating appearance and ignoring whether the product meets its functional purpose |
| **Developing** | Evaluates a product against its original design specification point by point, using testing evidence and user feedback to support judgements. | Evaluate your storage solution against the design specification. Use test results and user feedback to justify your assessment. | Evaluating generally without referring back to specific specification points; Stating a specification is 'met' without providing measurable evidence or test data |
| **Secure** | Conducts systematic evaluation using quantitative testing data, user trials, and comparison with existing commercial products. Proposes specific, justified modifications and considers manufacture at scale. | Evaluate your prototype phone stand against its specification, a commercial competitor, and user needs. Propose and justify two modifications for a production version. | Proposing modifications without considering cost, manufacturability, or material implications; Comparing with commercial products on appearance only rather than on performance metrics |
| **Mastery** | Critically evaluates the entire design-make-evaluate cycle, analysing the effectiveness of the design process itself and not just the outcome. Considers user needs beyond the specification, commercial viability, and iterative improvement strategy. | Critically evaluate both your product and your design process. Identify where in the process key decisions were made that affected the outcome, and propose a strategy for the next iteration. | Evaluating only the product outcome without reflecting critically on the design process decisions that led to it; Treating evaluation as a final step rather than as input to the next design iteration |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *It works well because the handle is comfortable to grip and the mechanism opens smoothly. I would improve the surface finish because it is rough in places, and I would make the base wider so it does not tip over.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Specification point 1: 'Must hold at least 2 kg.' Test result: it held 3.5 kg before deformation, so this is met with margin. Specification point 2: 'Must be easy for a child aged 6 to open.' User testing with three children showed two could open it independently, but one struggled with the clasp. This is partially met — the clasp could be replaced with a magnetic closure for easier operation.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *My prototype scored 4/5 on stability (tilt test to 20°) versus the commercial product's 5/5 (stable to 35°). User trials showed 8/10 users preferred my aesthetic design but noted the charging cable port was too narrow for some cables. Modification 1: widen the cable port to 15 mm (accommodates 95% of cables based on market survey) — costs minimal extra material. Modification 2: add a weighted rubber base to improve tilt stability — rubber sourcing adds £0.30 per unit but would match the commercial benchmark. Both modifications are viable for injection moulding at scale.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *The final product meets 7/8 specification points, but the failure in water resistance traces back to my material selection in week 3 — I chose MDF for machinability over marine plywood for moisture resistance. This was a process failure: I prioritised ease of making over fitness for purpose. User testing revealed an unanticipated need (portability) not captured in my specification, suggesting my initial research phase was too narrow — I surveyed users about home use only. For the next iteration: (1) revise the specification to include portability, (2) replace MDF with HDPE (waterproof, lightweight, injection-mouldable at scale), (3) conduct a broader user needs survey including outdoor use scenarios. This iterative approach aligns with commercial product development, where first prototypes inform specification revision before production.*

### Secondary concept: Material Properties and Selection (DT-KS4-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Material properties are the specific physical, mechanical, electrical, thermal and aesthetic characteristics that determine how a material behaves and what it can appropriately be used for. Physical properties include density, hardness, strength, elasticity and malleability. Mechanical properties include stiffness, toughness and compressive and tensile strength. Thermal properties include conductivity and resistance. Electrical properties include conductivity and resistance. Aesthetic properties include texture, colour, translucency and surface quality. Material selection requires matching the properties of available materials to the specific demands of a design brief, considering also cost, availability, environmental impact, and the manufacturing processes required to work with the material.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Names common materials (wood, metal, plastic, textile) and describes basic properties such as hard, soft, flexible, rigid, waterproof. | Choosing a material without linking the choice to specific required properties; Not considering food safety or hygiene when selecting materials for kitchen products |
| **Developing** | Classifies materials by type (hardwood, softwood, ferrous/non-ferrous metal, thermoforming/thermosetting polymer) and selects materials based on multiple properties including mechanical, physical, and working characteristics. | Comparing only one property (e.g. strength) without considering the full range of requirements; Not recognising that strength-to-weight ratio matters more than absolute strength for weight-critical applications |
| **Secure** | Analyses material properties quantitatively using data sheets, understands how material structure affects properties (grain structure, polymer chains, alloy composition), and selects materials with justified trade-offs for specific design contexts. | Selecting materials on a single headline property without checking that other critical requirements are met; Not linking macroscopic properties (impact resistance) to material microstructure (polymer chain flexibility) |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates material selection in the context of full product lifecycle including processing, cost, supply chain, environmental impact, and emerging materials. Analyses how smart and modern materials extend the design palette. | Concluding that the highest-performing material is always the best choice without considering manufacture, cost, and sustainability; Not recognising that CFRP's end-of-life limitations are a significant sustainability concern that affects design decisions |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** GCSE material selection requires pupils to rigorously match a material's structural properties (tensile strength, malleability, thermal conductivity) to the functional demands of a product specification — every selection decision is a structure-function argument.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- How do structural features at different scales interact to produce this function?
- What structural constraints limit what this system can do?
- Why have unrelated organisms evolved similar structures for similar functions?
- How would you apply structure-function analysis to improve this design?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Justifying material selection in GCSE examinations requires a structured argument: a candidate must state which material property meets which design requirement and cite evidence (material data, test results) to support the choice.

## Session structure: Practical Application

### Practical Application
A hands-on sequence where pupils apply knowledge and skills to solve a practical problem or create a functional outcome. Begins with a real-world context, builds skills through rehearsal, guides design or planning, supports making or problem-solving, and concludes with evaluation against success criteria.

`context` → `skill_rehearsal` → `design` → `make_or_solve` → `evaluate`

**Assessment:** Practical outcome (solution, product, program) evaluated against defined success criteria, with written or verbal explanation of the process and decisions made.

**Teacher note:** Use the PRACTICAL APPLICATION template: set a complex, authentic problem requiring independent selection and application of knowledge, techniques, and materials. Expect rigorous skill rehearsal, a justified design rationale, and precise execution. Demand critical evaluation against success criteria, including analysis of efficiency, accuracy, and fitness for purpose. Connect to exam-standard expectations.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How did you select and justify the techniques and materials for this task?
- What criteria define success for this application, and how will you measure them?
- How does your solution compare with alternative approaches in terms of efficiency and effectiveness?
- What would a critical evaluation of your process and outcome identify as areas for improvement?

## Design and Technology: Exam Preparation

**Design brief:** Work through a bank of past paper questions organised by topic. For each topic: attempt under timed conditions, peer-mark using the mark scheme, identify gaps in knowledge, and revise targeted areas. Create a personal revision plan based on identified weaknesses.

**Materials:** past paper questions (AQA, Edexcel, or OCR as appropriate), mark schemes, revision resources
**Tools:** exam papers, mark schemes, timer, revision notes
**Techniques:** command word identification, timed question practice, peer marking against mark scheme, gap analysis and revision planning, extended response structuring
**Safety notes:** No specific safety requirements for this classroom-based unit.

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Can you identify and respond to different command words correctly?
- Do your answers match the mark scheme requirements?
- Have you identified and addressed knowledge gaps?
- Can you write a structured extended response?

---

## Why this study matters

The written exam (50% of the GCSE) requires pupils to apply technical knowledge to unseen contexts. Structured practice with past paper questions -- identifying command words (describe, explain, evaluate, analyse), marking scheme expectations, and common examiner comments -- develops exam technique alongside subject knowledge. Working through questions collaboratively before attempting them independently scaffolds the transition from knowledge to application.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils describing when the question asks them to explain -- teach the hierarchy of command words explicitly
2. Answers too short for the marks available -- teach the 'one developed point per mark' rule
3. Rushing diagram questions -- annotated drawings with technical labels score highly if done carefully

|-----------|--------|
| Reading level | GCSE Examination Reader (Lexile 1050–1400) |
| Text-to-speech | Available |
| Vocabulary | Full examination-level vocabulary. Command words must be applied with precision under timed conditions. Tier 3 subject-specific vocabulary assumed. Nuanced use of hedging language (suggests, implies, indicates) expected in analytical writing. |
| Scaffolding level | None |
| Hint tiers | 2 tiers |
| Session length | 40–60 minutes |
| Feedback tone | Examination Precision Coach |
| Normalize struggle | Yes |
| Example correct feedback | *Grade 9 response. Every assessment objective addressed with precision. Your evaluation was balanced, your evidence was well-selected, and your conclusion was substantiated. Under timed conditions, this demonstrates examination readiness.* |
| Example error feedback | *Grade 5 response. You demonstrate knowledge (AO1) but your application (AO2) lacks the precision required at higher grades. Specifically: your explanation of osmosis confuses water potential with concentration gradient — the examiner report identifies this as the most common error at this grade boundary.* |
