## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Art History: Periods, Styles and Movements (AD-KS3-C003)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Art history organises the development of visual art, architecture and craft/design into periods (broadly chronological divisions), styles (distinctive approaches to form, technique and subject matter) and movements (organised groups of practitioners sharing aesthetic aims and often manifestos). Major movements include Renaissance, Baroque, Romanticism, Impressionism, Expressionism, Modernism and its variants, and Postmodernism. Understanding periods, styles and movements enables pupils to contextualise individual works, understand how artistic traditions develop through innovation and reaction, and situate their own creative work within the broader history of visual culture.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach art historical periods, styles and movements through specific exemplary works and practitioners. Build a coherent chronological framework so pupils can locate movements in relation to each other. Explore how movements respond to historical contexts: what social, political or cultural conditions produced this artistic response? Study works from multiple cultures and geographies to challenge the Euro-American centrism of much art historical teaching. Connect art history to studio practice: use historical movements as starting points for pupils' own work. Develop pupils' ability to make connections and comparisons across periods, cultures and disciplines.

**Key vocabulary:** period, style, movement, Renaissance, Baroque, Romanticism, Impressionism, Expressionism, Modernism, Postmodernism, avant-garde, tradition, influence, reaction, innovation

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may see art history as a fixed canon of important works rather than as a contested and constantly revised account of the past. Discussing how the canon is constructed and whose art has been excluded challenges this. The periodisation of art history into neat movements can imply a false tidiness; discussing how individual artists span or resist categorisation develops more nuanced understanding. Pupils may not see the relevance of art history to their own practice; making explicit connections between historical approaches and contemporary studio work addresses this.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can name a few famous artists (e.g., Van Gogh, Picasso) but has limited knowledge of when they worked, what movements they belonged to, or how their work relates to historical context. | Name one art movement and one artist associated with it. What makes their work different from art that came before? | Naming an artist without being able to connect them to a movement or explain what was distinctive about their approach; Describing what the paintings look like without explaining how they differed from what came before |
| **Developing** | Knows several major periods and movements in approximate chronological order, and can describe the distinctive characteristics of each with reference to specific artists and works. | Place these movements in chronological order: Pop Art, Renaissance, Impressionism, Cubism. For one movement, explain its key characteristics. | Confusing the chronological order of movements; Describing Cubism as simply 'using shapes' without explaining the multiple-viewpoint concept |
| **Secure** | Understands how movements respond to historical, social and political contexts, makes connections across periods and cultures, and uses art historical knowledge to inform their own creative practice. | The Dada movement emerged during World War I. Explain why the war led artists to reject traditional art forms, and how this rejection shaped the movement's approach. | Describing Dada as merely 'weird' or 'random' without understanding its purposeful relationship to the war; Not connecting the artistic rejection to the broader cultural and political crisis |
| **Mastery** | Critically examines the construction of the art historical canon, recognises whose art has been included and excluded, and applies art historical understanding to evaluate contemporary practice. | The traditional art history curriculum focuses primarily on white male European artists. Evaluate why this is problematic and suggest how a more inclusive art history would change our understanding of art. | Arguing for inclusion without providing specific examples of excluded artists and traditions; Treating the problem as simply 'adding more names' rather than questioning the criteria by which 'great art' was defined |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Impressionism — Claude Monet. Impressionist painters like Monet painted outdoors using visible brushstrokes and bright colours to capture the effect of light at a specific moment. This was different from earlier Academic art, which was painted in studios with smooth, invisible brushstrokes and focused on historical or mythological subjects.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Chronological order: Renaissance (c.1400-1600), Impressionism (c.1860-1890), Cubism (c.1907-1920), Pop Art (c.1955-1970). Cubism, pioneered by Picasso and Braque, broke objects into geometric fragments and showed multiple viewpoints simultaneously in a single image. Instead of painting what you see from one fixed position (as in Renaissance perspective), Cubists painted what they knew about the object — front, side and top combined. This challenged the 500-year-old convention of single-point perspective and opened the door to abstract art.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *World War I killed approximately 17 million people using industrial technology. Dada artists (Duchamp, Tzara, Arp) saw this as the catastrophic failure of European civilisation and its supposedly rational values — the same civilisation that had produced the great art traditions of the Renaissance, Baroque and Romanticism. If 'civilisation' could produce mechanised slaughter, then the art of that civilisation was implicated. Dada's response was deliberately anti-art: Duchamp submitted a urinal ('Fountain', 1917) as a sculpture; Hugo Ball recited nonsense poetry; collages were made from newspaper fragments about the war. The absurdity was intentional — it mirrored the absurdity of a world that called mass killing 'progress'. By rejecting traditional skill, beauty and meaning, Dada artists were rejecting the entire value system that had failed so catastrophically. This iconoclasm was not nihilism but a clearing of ground — it opened space for Surrealism, Conceptual Art and Performance Art, all of which question what art is and what it can do.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *The Western art historical canon was constructed by European institutions (academies, museums, universities) that reflected the power structures of their time: predominantly white, male, wealthy and colonial. Women artists (Artemisia Gentileschi, Frida Kahlo, Louise Bourgeois) were systematically excluded from academies, denied commissions and overlooked by historians — not because their work was inferior but because they operated outside the institutional system that defined 'great art'. Non-Western art traditions (Japanese woodblock printing, West African sculpture, Islamic geometric design, Aboriginal Australian painting) were collected as ethnographic curiosities rather than studied as art, reflecting a colonial hierarchy that treated European culture as civilisation and other cultures as objects of study. A more inclusive art history would: expand the definition of 'art' beyond painting and sculpture to include textiles, ceramics, body art and oral traditions; recognise that artistic innovation has always been global (Picasso's Cubism was directly influenced by African masks; Impressionism was shaped by Japanese prints); include artists marginalised by gender, race, disability and class; and examine how the canon itself was constructed and whose interests it served. This does not diminish Michelangelo or Rembrandt — it enriches our understanding by placing their work within a truly global history of human creative expression rather than a narrow European lineage.*

### Secondary concept: Critical Analysis and Evaluation (AD-KS3-C002)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Critical analysis involves the systematic examination of artworks, design objects or craft pieces using structured frameworks that consider formal elements, compositional choices, contextual factors and expressive or communicative qualities. Evaluation extends analysis to make judgements about the effectiveness, significance and quality of a work in relation to its apparent purposes and contexts. At KS3, pupils develop the ability to analyse and evaluate works rigorously and to apply this critical thinking to their own work in progress, using evaluation as a tool for iterative improvement.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can express a personal opinion about an artwork ('I like it' / 'I don't like it') but struggles to explain why, and does not use formal art vocabulary. | Describing what is depicted ('there is a tree') rather than how formal elements are used; Using everyday language ('it's pretty') rather than art-specific vocabulary ('warm palette', 'contrast') |
| **Developing** | Uses a structured analytical framework (formal elements, composition, context) to describe artworks, and begins to make evaluative judgements supported by specific visual evidence. | Identifying depth effects without explaining the specific techniques used to create them; Naming formal elements without explaining how they contribute to the overall effect |
| **Secure** | Analyses artworks with precision and depth, connecting formal analysis to meaning and context, and applies critical evaluation to their own work-in-progress to improve it iteratively. | Describing both works without making a comparative analysis that identifies similarities and differences; Not connecting the visual choices to the cultural and philosophical context of each period |
| **Mastery** | Constructs sophisticated critical arguments about art, challenges established interpretations with evidence, and uses analysis as a creative tool to inform and develop their own practice. | Defending Banksy without reference to art historical precedent or critical frameworks; Accepting the gallery/street binary rather than questioning the assumption behind it |

### Secondary concept: Personal Creative Voice (AD-KS3-C004)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

A personal creative voice is a distinctive approach to making and creating that reflects an individual's particular sensibility, interests, technical preferences and ways of seeing. At KS3, pupils are expected to move beyond technical competence to develop their own artistic identities, making increasingly personal and considered creative choices rather than simply following instructions or replicating given styles. Developing a personal creative voice requires taking creative risks, reflecting critically on outcomes, and sustaining creative enquiry over extended projects.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Follows instructions to produce work that looks similar to examples shown, but does not make independent creative choices or develop personal themes and approaches. | Choosing an obvious or generic response (e.g., a butterfly lifecycle) rather than a personally meaningful interpretation; Describing what the work would look like without explaining the personal connection or creative reasoning |
| **Developing** | Makes some independent creative choices within projects, begins to develop recurring themes or interests, and takes creative risks with growing confidence. | Not identifying connections between separate projects; Describing what to do next without connecting it to what they have already learned and are interested in |
| **Secure** | Develops a distinctive creative approach through sustained exploration, makes considered choices about subject matter, technique and presentation, and reflects critically on their own emerging creative identity. | Writing a statement that describes processes without explaining the ideas driving them; Not articulating what they want the viewer to think or feel |
| **Mastery** | Demonstrates a mature and distinctive creative voice, positions their work in relation to art historical and contemporary contexts, and uses creative practice as a form of critical inquiry. | Describing influence as imitation rather than as a process of absorbing methods and making them one's own; Not providing specific examples of how particular artists influenced their work in concrete ways |

## Thinking lens: Perspective and Interpretation (primary)

**Key question:** Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?

**Why this lens fits:** Critical analysis of artwork requires pupils to construct and defend an interpretation — recognising that meaning is not inherent but is actively constructed through the viewer's framework of understanding.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- What contextual factors shaped this perspective?
- How does the author's position affect the reliability of this account?
- Whose perspective is missing from this record, and why does that matter?
- How have interpretations of this event changed over time, and what drove those changes?

**Secondary lens:** Continuity and Change Over Time — The explicit sweep 'from ancient times to present' makes change over time the organising framework — pupils must understand how styles, movements and ideas develop, react against predecessors and persist or transform across centuries.

## Session structure: Creative Response

### Creative Response
A creative arts or writing sequence that develops technique through exposure to exemplary work, guided exploration of techniques, structured planning, independent creation, and peer critique. Balances creative freedom with technical skill development.

`exemplar_exposure` → `technique_exploration` → `planning` → `creating` → `critique`

**Assessment:** Final creative outcome (artwork, design, written piece) accompanied by a reflective evaluation discussing techniques used, influences, and areas for development.

**Teacher note:** Use the CREATIVE RESPONSE template: present exemplars from diverse traditions and guide critical analysis of technique, context, and meaning. Expect pupils to experiment with techniques, document their creative process, and produce work that demonstrates informed artistic or literary choices. Facilitate structured critique using subject-specific terminology and assessment criteria.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How does the context of this work influence its meaning?
- What techniques will you experiment with, and how do they serve your intention?
- How does your creative process connect to the exemplars you studied?
- What specific aspects of your work would you refine, and why?

## Art focus

**Artist:** Banksy / Jean-Michel Basquiat (unknown / 1960-1988)
**Art movement:** Street Art / Neo-Expressionism
**Medium:** mixed_media, paint
**Techniques:** stencil cutting, spray technique, large-scale composition, layering, typographic integration
**Visual elements:** shape, colour, space, line
**Cultural context:** British/American

---

## Why this study matters

Street art (Banksy, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Shepard Fairey) engages pupils who may not identify with traditional gallery art. The unit raises critical questions about art, ownership, public space, and the boundary between art and vandalism. Technically, it teaches stencil making, spray paint control, and large-scale composition. The strong graphic style develops understanding of visual impact and how art communicates in public contexts. This is often the unit that changes pupils' relationship with art as a subject.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Glorifying vandalism -- discuss the legal and ethical dimensions openly; distinguish commissioned murals from illegal graffiti
2. Stencils too complex to cut accurately -- start with bold, simple silhouettes
3. Spray paint health and safety -- always use in well-ventilated areas with masks; consider spray-free alternatives (sponge daubing)
