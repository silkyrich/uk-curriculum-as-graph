## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Advanced Technical Proficiency (AD-KS3-C001)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Technical proficiency in art and design involves the developed ability to use materials, tools and processes with skill, control and intentionality to achieve specific visual, tactile and expressive effects. At KS3, pupils move beyond the competent execution of learned techniques to develop personal approaches to materials and media, understanding how technical choices serve creative and communicative purposes. Proficiency is not merely mechanical accuracy but the integration of technical skill with critical and creative intelligence, enabling pupils to select, combine and adapt techniques in response to their creative intentions.

**Teaching guidance:** Set extended projects that require sustained engagement with specific materials and techniques. Encourage pupils to experiment at the edges of their technical capability rather than remaining in comfort zones. Build in regular opportunities for technical skill-building exercises alongside project work. Develop pupils' understanding of the relationship between technique and effect: why does this mark or process create this visual result? Model advanced technical skills and the professional habits of practice that support them. Connect to art history: how have artists developed personal technical vocabularies?

**Key vocabulary:** technique, media, proficiency, control, intentional, process, surface, material, application, manipulation, mark-making, layering, experimentation, refinement, mastery

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may separate technical skill from creative vision, seeing them as alternatives rather than as integrated. Emphasising that great technique serves creative intent prevents this split. Pupils may resist new technical challenges if they have established a comfortable approach; framing technical exploration as expanding creative vocabulary rather than abandoning current skills helps. The idea that proficiency requires sustained practice over time can be discouraging; celebrating incremental improvement maintains motivation.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Uses familiar materials and techniques with basic control, producing work that shows effort but limited range of media or intentionality in technical choices. | Create a tonal drawing of a shoe using pencil. Show at least three different tones from light to dark. | Using only outline with no tonal variation, producing a flat rather than three-dimensional drawing; Pressing hard for dark tones instead of using layered hatching or cross-hatching techniques |
| **Developing** | Experiments with a wider range of materials and techniques, showing growing control and beginning to make deliberate choices about which techniques serve their creative intentions. | Using two different media (e.g., charcoal and ink), create two studies of the same object. Annotate each with what you learned about the properties of the medium. | Producing two studies that look identical despite using different media, showing no exploration of each medium's distinctive qualities; Annotating with 'I liked this' rather than specific observations about what the medium does |
| **Secure** | Demonstrates confident control across a range of techniques and media, selects approaches with clear creative intent, and integrates technical skill with expressive and communicative purpose. | Choose a technique and medium that best communicates the idea of 'growth'. Produce the work and write a 50-word justification of your technical choices. | Choosing a technique without being able to explain why it communicates the intended idea; Describing what was done technically without connecting it to creative meaning |
| **Mastery** | Develops a personal technical vocabulary, combining and adapting techniques in innovative ways, and demonstrates sophisticated understanding of the relationship between technique, material and meaning. | An artist uses only found materials (rubbish, discarded objects) to make portraits. Evaluate how the choice of materials changes the meaning of the artwork compared to conventional portrait painting. | Evaluating the work only on whether it 'looks like' the person rather than considering how material choice creates meaning; Not connecting the technique to art historical precedents or broader ideas about art and materials |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *The drawing shows the shoe from direct observation with three clear tonal values: light areas where the surface catches light, mid-tones on the body of the shoe, and dark shadows in the creases and under the sole. The pencil marks follow the contours of the shoe, creating a sense of three-dimensional form.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Charcoal study: 'Charcoal creates soft, smudgeable marks that are good for smooth gradations of tone. I used the side of the charcoal stick for broad shadows and the tip for fine detail. The eraser lifts charcoal to create highlights. The effect is atmospheric and slightly blurred.' Ink study: 'Ink gives sharp, permanent lines with no gradation — a mark is either there or not. I used hatching to build tone because ink cannot be blended like charcoal. The effect is more graphic and defined. Cross-hatching in the shadows created depth.'*

> **Model response (Secure):** *I chose watercolour wet-on-wet technique because the way colour bleeds and spreads unpredictably on wet paper mirrors how plants grow — organically, without straight lines, responding to their environment. I dropped concentrated green pigment onto pre-wet paper and tilted it to create branching flows. The lack of hard edges suggests living, dynamic growth rather than static form. The translucent layers show accumulation over time.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Using found materials transforms the portrait from a representation of appearance to a commentary on identity and value. When a face is constructed from discarded packaging, broken electronics and waste fabric, the viewer is forced to reconcile the human dignity of the subject with the low status of the materials, creating a tension that provokes questions: what do we discard? Who do we overlook? The texture and colour of found materials are uncontrollable in ways paint is not — the artist must work with what exists rather than mixing an exact colour, which introduces an element of responsive improvisation absent from traditional portraiture. The materials also carry their own history: a piece of newspaper brings its own text and images, adding unintended meaning layers. Technically, the challenge shifts from depicting surface appearance to constructing recognisable form from irregular, resistant materials — a sculptural and compositional problem rather than a rendering one. The work references Cubist collage (Picasso, Braque), Dada assemblage (Schwitters), and contemporary artists like Vik Muniz, placing it within a tradition of using 'low' materials to question hierarchies of art and value.*

### Secondary concept: Art History: Periods, Styles and Movements (AD-KS3-C003)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Art history organises the development of visual art, architecture and craft/design into periods (broadly chronological divisions), styles (distinctive approaches to form, technique and subject matter) and movements (organised groups of practitioners sharing aesthetic aims and often manifestos). Major movements include Renaissance, Baroque, Romanticism, Impressionism, Expressionism, Modernism and its variants, and Postmodernism. Understanding periods, styles and movements enables pupils to contextualise individual works, understand how artistic traditions develop through innovation and reaction, and situate their own creative work within the broader history of visual culture.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can name a few famous artists (e.g., Van Gogh, Picasso) but has limited knowledge of when they worked, what movements they belonged to, or how their work relates to historical context. | Naming an artist without being able to connect them to a movement or explain what was distinctive about their approach; Describing what the paintings look like without explaining how they differed from what came before |
| **Developing** | Knows several major periods and movements in approximate chronological order, and can describe the distinctive characteristics of each with reference to specific artists and works. | Confusing the chronological order of movements; Describing Cubism as simply 'using shapes' without explaining the multiple-viewpoint concept |
| **Secure** | Understands how movements respond to historical, social and political contexts, makes connections across periods and cultures, and uses art historical knowledge to inform their own creative practice. | Describing Dada as merely 'weird' or 'random' without understanding its purposeful relationship to the war; Not connecting the artistic rejection to the broader cultural and political crisis |
| **Mastery** | Critically examines the construction of the art historical canon, recognises whose art has been included and excluded, and applies art historical understanding to evaluate contemporary practice. | Arguing for inclusion without providing specific examples of excluded artists and traditions; Treating the problem as simply 'adding more names' rather than questioning the criteria by which 'great art' was defined |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Technical proficiency is the capacity to control how a medium's physical structure (pigment behaviour, layering, mark-making) serves expressive function; developing a personal voice requires intentional deployment of these structural choices to communicate specific meanings.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- How does the structure at this scale enable the function we observe?
- What trade-offs were involved in this structural design?
- How is this structure adapted to solve a specific problem?
- What would you predict about an organism's function from its structure alone?

**Secondary lens:** Continuity and Change Over Time — The explicit sweep 'from ancient times to present' makes change over time the organising framework — pupils must understand how styles, movements and ideas develop, react against predecessors and persist or transform across centuries.

## Session structure: Creative Response

### Creative Response
A creative arts or writing sequence that develops technique through exposure to exemplary work, guided exploration of techniques, structured planning, independent creation, and peer critique. Balances creative freedom with technical skill development.

`exemplar_exposure` → `technique_exploration` → `planning` → `creating` → `critique`

**Assessment:** Final creative outcome (artwork, design, written piece) accompanied by a reflective evaluation discussing techniques used, influences, and areas for development.

**Teacher note:** Use the CREATIVE RESPONSE template: present exemplars from diverse traditions and guide critical analysis of technique, context, and meaning. Expect pupils to experiment with techniques, document their creative process, and produce work that demonstrates informed artistic or literary choices. Facilitate structured critique using subject-specific terminology and assessment criteria.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How does the context of this work influence its meaning?
- What techniques will you experiment with, and how do they serve your intention?
- How does your creative process connect to the exemplars you studied?
- What specific aspects of your work would you refine, and why?

## Art focus

**Artist:** Ernst Ludwig Kirchner / Edvard Munch (1880-1938 / 1863-1944)
**Art movement:** Expressionism
**Medium:** print
**Techniques:** reduction lino cutting, multi-colour printing, registration, ink mixing, edition printing
**Visual elements:** colour, line, pattern, tone
**Cultural context:** German/Norwegian

---

## Why this study matters

Reduction lino printing is one of the most satisfying and technically demanding printmaking processes accessible at KS3. Pupils print an edition, then cut away more of the block and print a second colour on top, building up layers. This teaches colour theory (how overlapping colours interact), planning (the process is irreversible -- each cut is permanent), and the discipline of registration. The technique connects to Hokusai (KS2) and extends to Expressionist woodcuts (Kirchner, Munch) for art history context.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Cutting away too much in early layers -- plan the whole sequence of cuts before starting
2. Poor registration between layers -- use a jig or registration marks from the first print
3. Safety with lino cutters -- always cut away from the body; use bench hooks; heat the lino for easier cutting
