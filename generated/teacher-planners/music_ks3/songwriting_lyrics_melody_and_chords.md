## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Compositional Techniques and Devices (MU-KS3-C003)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Compositional techniques are the methods composers use to develop, extend and transform musical material. Key devices include: ostinato (a repeated pattern over which other music is built), sequence (a melodic idea repeated at a different pitch level), imitation (one part echoing another after a time delay), augmentation and diminution (presenting a rhythm or melody in longer or shorter note values), and inversion (turning a melody upside down). Structure provides the large-scale organisation of a composition. At KS3, pupils develop the craft of composition by learning to use these techniques with intention and understanding their effect.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach each device through listening examples where it is clearly audible, then practice using it in simple compositional exercises before applying it in projects. Help pupils understand the effect of each device: ostinato creates continuity; sequence creates a sense of development; imitation creates dialogue. Analyse how professional composers use these devices in the repertoire pupils are performing and listening to. Set composition tasks that specify the use of particular devices, then allow pupils to choose devices freely in more open projects. Evaluate how effectively devices have been used in terms of their musical effect.

**Key vocabulary:** ostinato, sequence, imitation, augmentation, diminution, inversion, retrograde, motif, theme, development, variation, structure, form, binary, ternary, rondo

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may use compositional devices mechanically without understanding their effect; always discussing the musical consequences of each device prevents this. Imitation can be confused with strict canon; explaining that imitation need not be exact or complete distinguishes the concepts. Pupils may not see the connection between compositional devices and the music they listen to; deliberate analytical listening that identifies devices in real pieces makes the connection.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can create a short musical idea (a melody or rhythm), but does not develop or extend it beyond initial statement — compositions tend to be short, repetitive or structureless. | Compose a 4-bar melody using notes from the C major scale. It should have a clear beginning and ending. | Ending on a note other than the tonic, giving no sense of completion; Using only one rhythmic value throughout (e.g., all crotchets), creating a monotonous rhythm |
| **Developing** | Uses compositional devices such as repetition, sequence and contrast to develop musical ideas, and organises compositions into recognisable sections with some structural logic. | Take your 4-bar melody and extend it to 8 bars using the technique of sequence (repeating the melody at a different pitch level). | Repeating the melody at exactly the same pitch rather than transposing it (this is repetition, not sequence); Changing the rhythm or intervals when transposing, losing the sequential pattern |
| **Secure** | Composes with command of multiple devices, uses form deliberately (binary, ternary, rondo), and makes purposeful choices about texture, dynamics and instrumentation to achieve specific effects. | Compose a piece in ternary form (ABA) where section A uses an ostinato and section B uses imitation. Explain how the contrast between sections creates musical interest. | Writing three sections without genuine contrast between A and B; Not connecting the return of section A to what happened in section B |
| **Mastery** | Composes with sophistication, combining multiple devices fluently, creating pieces with emotional arc and structural coherence, and explaining compositional decisions with reference to the musical effects intended. | Analyse a compositional device used by a professional composer in a piece you have studied. Then demonstrate how you have applied a similar technique in your own composition. | Describing the professional technique without demonstrating how it was applied in their own work; Applying the technique mechanically without adapting it to serve their own musical intentions |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *The melody begins on C (the tonic, establishing the key), rises stepwise through D and E, leaps to G in bar 2 (creating interest), then descends through F, E, D in bar 3 before ending on C in bar 4 (returning home to the tonic, giving a sense of completion). The rhythm uses a mix of crotchets and quavers to create rhythmic variety.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Bars 1-4: original melody starting on C (C D E G F E D C). Bars 5-8: the same melodic pattern starting on G, a fifth higher (G A B D C B A G). This is a sequence because the intervals and rhythm are identical but everything is transposed up by a fifth. The sequence creates a sense of development — the musical idea has moved forward rather than simply being repeated. The higher pitch level adds energy and intensity before the piece could return to the original level for a final statement.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Section A: A repeating bass ostinato (C-G-Ab-G, 4 beats) creates a stable, hypnotic foundation. Over this, a melody enters on keyboard, building gradually. The ostinato gives section A a grounded, persistent character. Section B: The ostinato stops. Instead, a new melody is introduced on one instrument and then imitated (echoed) a bar later by a second instrument, a fifth higher. The imitation creates a conversational texture — two voices interacting rather than one voice over a static pattern. This contrasts with A's simplicity. Section A returns: the familiar ostinato reappears, but now I add a countermelody derived from the imitation in section B, so the return is enriched by what happened in the middle section. The contrast works because section A is static and layered while section B is linear and dialogic — the shift in texture and approach gives the listener something genuinely new before the satisfying return of familiar material.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *In Holst's 'Mars' from The Planets, the opening uses a 5/4 ostinato in the strings (col legno — hitting the strings with the wood of the bow) that creates a relentless, mechanical pulse suggesting a military march. Holst builds tension by layering increasingly aggressive melodic fragments over this unchanging rhythmic foundation. The contrast between the static ostinato and the developing upper parts creates extraordinary cumulative intensity. In my own composition, I applied a similar technique: I wrote a 7/8 ostinato on a bass guitar (an irregular metre that creates unease, like Holst's 5/4) and layered three successive melodic entries over it, each higher and louder than the last. I used augmentation in the final entry — stretching the rhythm to twice its original length — so the melody seems to struggle against the relentless bass, creating a sense of conflict between the parts. The technique works because the listener latches onto the ostinato as 'ground' and experiences the melodic additions as 'figure' — the growing complexity creates tension without losing the structural anchor.*

### Secondary concept: Advanced Performance Skills (MU-KS3-C001)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Advanced performance skills at KS3 encompass technical proficiency (accurate and fluent execution of pitches, rhythms and techniques), musical expression (the communication of character, emotion and musical meaning through phrasing, dynamics and articulation), stylistic awareness (adapting technique and expression to the demands of different musical styles and traditions), and ensemble musicianship (listening, balancing, responding and contributing to a shared musical outcome). These dimensions of performance are interdependent: technical accuracy without expression produces mechanical playing, while expressive intent without technical control cannot be reliably communicated.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can play simple pieces with basic accuracy in a group setting, but performance lacks fluency, expression or awareness of other players. | Rushing through the piece rather than maintaining a steady pulse; Playing correct notes but with no attention to rhythm or note duration |
| **Developing** | Performs with reasonable accuracy and fluency, begins to add dynamic variation and phrasing, and shows awareness of other parts in ensemble performance. | Playing at one volume throughout without dynamic contrast; Making the crescendo as an abrupt jump rather than a gradual increase |
| **Secure** | Performs confidently in both solo and ensemble contexts with accuracy, fluency and expression, adapts technique and phrasing to different musical styles, and listens and responds to other performers. | Playing both versions identically, showing no stylistic differentiation; Swinging the rhythm without also adjusting articulation, tone and accentuation |
| **Mastery** | Performs with interpretive depth, communicating musical character and structure to an audience, demonstrates sophisticated ensemble musicianship, and can discuss performance choices using musical terminology. | Describing technical decisions (fingering, breathing) rather than interpretive decisions that affect musical communication; Not explaining how each decision will affect the listener's experience |

### Secondary concept: Tonality and Harmony (MU-KS3-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Tonality refers to the organisation of music around a central pitch (the tonic) and the hierarchical relationships between all other pitches, creating a sense of stability, tension and resolution. Major and minor tonalities are the most common in Western music, each with characteristic emotional associations and scale patterns. Modal scales (Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian and others) organise pitch in different hierarchical patterns, each with a distinctive character. Harmony refers to the simultaneous sounding of two or more pitches and the way chords progress to create movement, tension and resolution. At KS3, pupils develop understanding of tonality and harmony as foundational elements of musical structure and expression.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify whether music sounds 'happy' (major) or 'sad' (minor) and recognise a simple chord change, but cannot name scales, keys or explain harmonic function. | Relying only on tempo (fast = happy, slow = sad) rather than listening to the tonality itself; Not being able to distinguish major and minor when both pieces are at the same tempo |
| **Developing** | Can play major and minor scales, identify primary chords (I, IV, V), and use simple chord progressions as a framework for composition and improvisation. | Playing the minor scale with incorrect flattened notes; Naming the chords by letter only (C, F, G) without understanding their functional Roman numeral designations |
| **Secure** | Understands the harmonic function of chords, uses modal scales in composition, hears and identifies harmonic movement aurally, and explains how tonality creates emotional and structural effects. | Writing a composition that sounds like natural minor because the characteristic raised 6th is not emphasised; Confusing the Dorian mode with other modes such as Aeolian (natural minor) or Mixolydian |
| **Mastery** | Analyses sophisticated harmonic language in real music, understands how composers use tonality for structural and expressive purposes, and applies advanced harmonic knowledge in their own composition and improvisation. | Not identifying the specific note or chord that signals the modulation; Confusing modulation (changing key) with merely using an accidental (a chromatic note within the same key) |

## Thinking lens: Systems and System Models (primary)

**Key question:** What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?

**Why this lens fits:** Advanced ensemble performance at KS3 requires modelling the performance as a coordinated system — each player's technical and expressive choices must be calibrated to the whole, with stylistic awareness shaping how the system sounds collectively.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- What feedback loops exist in this system?
- Does this model capture all the important interactions, or does it oversimplify?
- What emergent property arises from these components interacting?
- How would removing or adding a component change the system's behaviour?

**Secondary lens:** Patterns — Techniques such as sequence (transposing a motif) and ostinato (repeating a figure) are pattern operations applied to musical material; fluent use of these devices requires deep pattern recognition and manipulation ability.

## Session structure: Creative Response

### Creative Response
A creative arts or writing sequence that develops technique through exposure to exemplary work, guided exploration of techniques, structured planning, independent creation, and peer critique. Balances creative freedom with technical skill development.

`exemplar_exposure` → `technique_exploration` → `planning` → `creating` → `critique`

**Assessment:** Final creative outcome (artwork, design, written piece) accompanied by a reflective evaluation discussing techniques used, influences, and areas for development.

**Teacher note:** Use the CREATIVE RESPONSE template: present exemplars from diverse traditions and guide critical analysis of technique, context, and meaning. Expect pupils to experiment with techniques, document their creative process, and produce work that demonstrates informed artistic or literary choices. Facilitate structured critique using subject-specific terminology and assessment criteria.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How does the context of this work influence its meaning?
- What techniques will you experiment with, and how do they serve your intention?
- How does your creative process connect to the exemplars you studied?
- What specific aspects of your work would you refine, and why?

## Why this study matters

Songwriting is the composition vehicle that most naturally engages KS3 pupils because it connects music to language, personal expression, and the popular music they listen to daily. Pupils learn the craft of setting words to music: syllabic stress, melodic contour, verse-chorus structure, and the relationship between lyric meaning and harmonic colour. Using the four-chord progression (I-V-vi-IV) as a starting point provides harmonic security while allowing melodic creativity. The unit integrates composing, performing, and critical listening of popular music.

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Lyrics too personal or emotional for sharing in class -- offer neutral themes (a journey, a memory, a place) alongside free choice
2. Melody disconnected from chords -- teach how chord tones anchor the melody and passing notes connect them
3. No attention to song form -- teach verse, pre-chorus, chorus structure before free writing
