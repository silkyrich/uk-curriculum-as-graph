## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Compositional Techniques and Devices (MU-KS3-C003)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Compositional techniques are the methods composers use to develop, extend and transform musical material. Key devices include: ostinato (a repeated pattern over which other music is built), sequence (a melodic idea repeated at a different pitch level), imitation (one part echoing another after a time delay), augmentation and diminution (presenting a rhythm or melody in longer or shorter note values), and inversion (turning a melody upside down). Structure provides the large-scale organisation of a composition. At KS3, pupils develop the craft of composition by learning to use these techniques with intention and understanding their effect.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach each device through listening examples where it is clearly audible, then practice using it in simple compositional exercises before applying it in projects. Help pupils understand the effect of each device: ostinato creates continuity; sequence creates a sense of development; imitation creates dialogue. Analyse how professional composers use these devices in the repertoire pupils are performing and listening to. Set composition tasks that specify the use of particular devices, then allow pupils to choose devices freely in more open projects. Evaluate how effectively devices have been used in terms of their musical effect.

**Key vocabulary:** ostinato, sequence, imitation, augmentation, diminution, inversion, retrograde, motif, theme, development, variation, structure, form, binary, ternary, rondo

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may use compositional devices mechanically without understanding their effect; always discussing the musical consequences of each device prevents this. Imitation can be confused with strict canon; explaining that imitation need not be exact or complete distinguishes the concepts. Pupils may not see the connection between compositional devices and the music they listen to; deliberate analytical listening that identifies devices in real pieces makes the connection.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can create a short musical idea (a melody or rhythm), but does not develop or extend it beyond initial statement — compositions tend to be short, repetitive or structureless. | Compose a 4-bar melody using notes from the C major scale. It should have a clear beginning and ending. | Ending on a note other than the tonic, giving no sense of completion; Using only one rhythmic value throughout (e.g., all crotchets), creating a monotonous rhythm |
| **Developing** | Uses compositional devices such as repetition, sequence and contrast to develop musical ideas, and organises compositions into recognisable sections with some structural logic. | Take your 4-bar melody and extend it to 8 bars using the technique of sequence (repeating the melody at a different pitch level). | Repeating the melody at exactly the same pitch rather than transposing it (this is repetition, not sequence); Changing the rhythm or intervals when transposing, losing the sequential pattern |
| **Secure** | Composes with command of multiple devices, uses form deliberately (binary, ternary, rondo), and makes purposeful choices about texture, dynamics and instrumentation to achieve specific effects. | Compose a piece in ternary form (ABA) where section A uses an ostinato and section B uses imitation. Explain how the contrast between sections creates musical interest. | Writing three sections without genuine contrast between A and B; Not connecting the return of section A to what happened in section B |
| **Mastery** | Composes with sophistication, combining multiple devices fluently, creating pieces with emotional arc and structural coherence, and explaining compositional decisions with reference to the musical effects intended. | Analyse a compositional device used by a professional composer in a piece you have studied. Then demonstrate how you have applied a similar technique in your own composition. | Describing the professional technique without demonstrating how it was applied in their own work; Applying the technique mechanically without adapting it to serve their own musical intentions |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *The melody begins on C (the tonic, establishing the key), rises stepwise through D and E, leaps to G in bar 2 (creating interest), then descends through F, E, D in bar 3 before ending on C in bar 4 (returning home to the tonic, giving a sense of completion). The rhythm uses a mix of crotchets and quavers to create rhythmic variety.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Bars 1-4: original melody starting on C (C D E G F E D C). Bars 5-8: the same melodic pattern starting on G, a fifth higher (G A B D C B A G). This is a sequence because the intervals and rhythm are identical but everything is transposed up by a fifth. The sequence creates a sense of development — the musical idea has moved forward rather than simply being repeated. The higher pitch level adds energy and intensity before the piece could return to the original level for a final statement.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Section A: A repeating bass ostinato (C-G-Ab-G, 4 beats) creates a stable, hypnotic foundation. Over this, a melody enters on keyboard, building gradually. The ostinato gives section A a grounded, persistent character. Section B: The ostinato stops. Instead, a new melody is introduced on one instrument and then imitated (echoed) a bar later by a second instrument, a fifth higher. The imitation creates a conversational texture — two voices interacting rather than one voice over a static pattern. This contrasts with A's simplicity. Section A returns: the familiar ostinato reappears, but now I add a countermelody derived from the imitation in section B, so the return is enriched by what happened in the middle section. The contrast works because section A is static and layered while section B is linear and dialogic — the shift in texture and approach gives the listener something genuinely new before the satisfying return of familiar material.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *In Holst's 'Mars' from The Planets, the opening uses a 5/4 ostinato in the strings (col legno — hitting the strings with the wood of the bow) that creates a relentless, mechanical pulse suggesting a military march. Holst builds tension by layering increasingly aggressive melodic fragments over this unchanging rhythmic foundation. The contrast between the static ostinato and the developing upper parts creates extraordinary cumulative intensity. In my own composition, I applied a similar technique: I wrote a 7/8 ostinato on a bass guitar (an irregular metre that creates unease, like Holst's 5/4) and layered three successive melodic entries over it, each higher and louder than the last. I used augmentation in the final entry — stretching the rhythm to twice its original length — so the melody seems to struggle against the relentless bass, creating a sense of conflict between the parts. The technique works because the listener latches onto the ostinato as 'ground' and experiences the melodic additions as 'figure' — the growing complexity creates tension without losing the structural anchor.*

### Secondary concept: Musical Traditions and World Music (MU-KS3-C004)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

World music encompasses the musical traditions of diverse cultures across the globe, each with its own characteristic scales, rhythms, textures, instruments, performance practices and cultural functions. Understanding world music traditions requires both musical analysis (identifying characteristic features) and cultural contextualisation (understanding the social, spiritual and ceremonial roles music plays in different communities). At KS3, pupils extend their musical experience beyond Western art and popular music to develop appreciation and understanding of diverse global musical traditions, enriching both their listening and their compositional resources.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Has limited experience of music from different cultures and tends to evaluate unfamiliar music using the standards of familiar Western pop or classical genres. | Describing the music as 'just drums' without identifying the complex rhythmic relationships; Judging it as 'simple' because it has no melody or harmony in the Western sense |
| **Developing** | Can identify characteristic features of several world music traditions and understands that different traditions use different musical systems and serve different cultural functions. | Describing Indian music as 'not having structure' because it is improvised, not recognising the raga system as a sophisticated structural framework; Treating Western music as the norm and Indian music as the deviation |
| **Secure** | Studies world music traditions in depth, connecting musical features to cultural context and function, and uses diverse musical traditions as creative resources in their own composition and performance. | Describing gamelan using Western terms (melody, harmony, rhythm) without explaining the culture-specific structural concepts; Not connecting the musical structure to the cultural values it reflects |
| **Mastery** | Critically evaluates how world music is presented and consumed in Western contexts, understands issues of cultural appropriation versus appreciation, and engages with diverse traditions on their own terms. | Treating the issue as purely a copyright question rather than a cultural and ethical one; Not distinguishing between cultural appropriation (taking without consent or understanding) and cultural appreciation or collaboration |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Compositional Techniques and Devices — ostinato, sequence, imitation, augmentation, diminution, structural forms — are explicitly structural concepts whose value is understood through how each shapes the function and effect of a musical passage.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- How does the structure at this scale enable the function we observe?
- What trade-offs were involved in this structural design?
- How is this structure adapted to solve a specific problem?
- What would you predict about an organism's function from its structure alone?

**Secondary lens:** Perspective and Interpretation — Appraising world music and diverse cultural contexts requires pupils to suspend familiar Western conventions and listen from within unfamiliar aesthetic frameworks — the central cognitive demand is constructing and sustaining an interpretive position shaped by cultural knowledge.

## Session structure: Creative Response

### Creative Response
A creative arts or writing sequence that develops technique through exposure to exemplary work, guided exploration of techniques, structured planning, independent creation, and peer critique. Balances creative freedom with technical skill development.

`exemplar_exposure` → `technique_exploration` → `planning` → `creating` → `critique`

**Assessment:** Final creative outcome (artwork, design, written piece) accompanied by a reflective evaluation discussing techniques used, influences, and areas for development.

**Teacher note:** Use the CREATIVE RESPONSE template: present exemplars from diverse traditions and guide critical analysis of technique, context, and meaning. Expect pupils to experiment with techniques, document their creative process, and produce work that demonstrates informed artistic or literary choices. Facilitate structured critique using subject-specific terminology and assessment criteria.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How does the context of this work influence its meaning?
- What techniques will you experiment with, and how do they serve your intention?
- How does your creative process connect to the exemplars you studied?
- What specific aspects of your work would you refine, and why?

**Instruments:** keyboard, technology
**Notation level:** graphic
**Listening repertoire:** Jaws Theme - John Williams, Interstellar - Hans Zimmer, Final Fantasy VII - Nobuo Uematsu

## Why this study matters

Composing music to visual media (film clips, game scenarios) is the most motivating composition brief at KS3 because it gives compositional decisions an immediate dramatic purpose. Pupils learn how tempo, dynamics, timbre and silence create tension, excitement, sadness or comedy. Working to a timeline teaches structural awareness and precise timing. The unit connects to KS2 film music work but extends it with more sophisticated compositional devices (leitmotif, underscore, diegetic vs non-diegetic sound). Analysing scores by John Williams, Hans Zimmer and Nobuo Uematsu develops critical listening vocabulary.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Music plays continuously without silence -- teach that silence creates more tension than sound
2. Not matching music to on-screen events -- teach 'spotting' (identifying hit points)
3. Over-relying on pre-made loops -- require at least one originally composed melodic or rhythmic idea
