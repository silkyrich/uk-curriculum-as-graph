## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Advanced Performance Skills (MU-KS3-C001)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Advanced performance skills at KS3 encompass technical proficiency (accurate and fluent execution of pitches, rhythms and techniques), musical expression (the communication of character, emotion and musical meaning through phrasing, dynamics and articulation), stylistic awareness (adapting technique and expression to the demands of different musical styles and traditions), and ensemble musicianship (listening, balancing, responding and contributing to a shared musical outcome). These dimensions of performance are interdependent: technical accuracy without expression produces mechanical playing, while expressive intent without technical control cannot be reliably communicated.

**Teaching guidance:** Set performance goals that specify both technical and expressive targets. Use recordings of professional performances for analysis: what specific technical and expressive choices does this performer make? Develop ensemble listening skills through activities that require pupils to adjust their playing in response to others. Teach stylistic awareness by comparing performances of the same piece in different styles. Develop performance confidence through regular low-stakes performance opportunities as well as formal performances. Use self-recording and playback as a tool for reflective improvement.

**Key vocabulary:** technique, fluency, accuracy, expression, phrasing, dynamics, articulation, tone, stylistic, ensemble, balance, blend, communicate, interpret, perform

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may equate technical accuracy with good performance, overlooking the expressive dimension that makes music meaningful. Discussing and demonstrating how the same piece sounds different with different expressive choices addresses this. Pupils may believe they cannot play expressively until they are technically perfect; exploring expression within technical capability rather than waiting for technical mastery first builds expressive confidence earlier. Ensemble performance requires active listening as well as playing; developing the habit of listening across the ensemble needs consistent emphasis.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can play simple pieces with basic accuracy in a group setting, but performance lacks fluency, expression or awareness of other players. | Perform the melody of 'Ode to Joy' on your instrument. Play it at a steady tempo with correct notes. | Rushing through the piece rather than maintaining a steady pulse; Playing correct notes but with no attention to rhythm or note duration |
| **Developing** | Performs with reasonable accuracy and fluency, begins to add dynamic variation and phrasing, and shows awareness of other parts in ensemble performance. | Perform this 8-bar melody with the following dynamic markings: bars 1-4 piano (quiet), bars 5-6 crescendo, bars 7-8 forte (loud). Explain why the dynamics might change at bar 5. | Playing at one volume throughout without dynamic contrast; Making the crescendo as an abrupt jump rather than a gradual increase |
| **Secure** | Performs confidently in both solo and ensemble contexts with accuracy, fluency and expression, adapts technique and phrasing to different musical styles, and listens and responds to other performers. | Perform the same piece in two different styles: first as a classical piece with legato phrasing, then as a jazz piece with swing rhythm. Explain what you changed and why. | Playing both versions identically, showing no stylistic differentiation; Swinging the rhythm without also adjusting articulation, tone and accentuation |
| **Mastery** | Performs with interpretive depth, communicating musical character and structure to an audience, demonstrates sophisticated ensemble musicianship, and can discuss performance choices using musical terminology. | You are preparing to perform a piece for an audience. Describe three specific interpretive decisions you have made and how each will affect what the audience hears and feels. | Describing technical decisions (fingering, breathing) rather than interpretive decisions that affect musical communication; Not explaining how each decision will affect the listener's experience |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *The melody is played with correct pitches throughout, at a steady tempo maintained from start to finish. The rhythm is accurate, with crotchets and minims given their correct duration. Notes are clearly articulated rather than blurred together.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Performance demonstrates clear distinction between piano and forte sections, with a gradual crescendo over bars 5-6 rather than an abrupt change. The dynamics change at bar 5 because the melody rises to its highest pitch and the rhythm becomes more urgent — the crescendo supports the musical tension building towards the climax in bar 7, where the forte arrival feels like a resolution of that tension.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Classical version: I played with smooth, connected (legato) phrasing, even dynamics within each phrase with a slight swell towards the peak, and precise rhythmic values as written. The tone was clean and controlled. Jazz version: I swung the quavers (playing them as long-short pairs rather than evenly), added a slight accent on beats 2 and 4 (the backbeat), used a warmer, more relaxed tone, and added a small slide between some notes for a bluesy feel. The classical version communicates through precise control of the written notes; the jazz version communicates through rhythmic feel, tonal colour and subtle departures from the written score.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Decision 1: I will take a slight ritardando (slowing down) in bar 12 before the return of the main theme in bar 13. This signals to the audience that something important is about to happen — the familiar theme returning after the contrasting middle section. The brief pause creates anticipation. Decision 2: In the minor section (bars 8-12), I will use a thinner, more focused tone with less vibrato than in the major sections. The reduced warmth of tone reinforces the shift from major (bright, open) to minor (darker, more introspective), making the harmonic change audible through timbre as well as pitch. Decision 3: I will make the final phrase slightly softer than the rest of the piece, ending pianissimo rather than forte. This creates a reflective, contemplative ending rather than a triumphant one — which I believe suits the gentle, lyrical character of the piece better than a loud conclusion would.*

### Secondary concept: Tonality and Harmony (MU-KS3-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Tonality refers to the organisation of music around a central pitch (the tonic) and the hierarchical relationships between all other pitches, creating a sense of stability, tension and resolution. Major and minor tonalities are the most common in Western music, each with characteristic emotional associations and scale patterns. Modal scales (Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian and others) organise pitch in different hierarchical patterns, each with a distinctive character. Harmony refers to the simultaneous sounding of two or more pitches and the way chords progress to create movement, tension and resolution. At KS3, pupils develop understanding of tonality and harmony as foundational elements of musical structure and expression.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify whether music sounds 'happy' (major) or 'sad' (minor) and recognise a simple chord change, but cannot name scales, keys or explain harmonic function. | Relying only on tempo (fast = happy, slow = sad) rather than listening to the tonality itself; Not being able to distinguish major and minor when both pieces are at the same tempo |
| **Developing** | Can play major and minor scales, identify primary chords (I, IV, V), and use simple chord progressions as a framework for composition and improvisation. | Playing the minor scale with incorrect flattened notes; Naming the chords by letter only (C, F, G) without understanding their functional Roman numeral designations |
| **Secure** | Understands the harmonic function of chords, uses modal scales in composition, hears and identifies harmonic movement aurally, and explains how tonality creates emotional and structural effects. | Writing a composition that sounds like natural minor because the characteristic raised 6th is not emphasised; Confusing the Dorian mode with other modes such as Aeolian (natural minor) or Mixolydian |
| **Mastery** | Analyses sophisticated harmonic language in real music, understands how composers use tonality for structural and expressive purposes, and applies advanced harmonic knowledge in their own composition and improvisation. | Not identifying the specific note or chord that signals the modulation; Confusing modulation (changing key) with merely using an accidental (a chromatic note within the same key) |

## Thinking lens: Systems and System Models (primary)

**Key question:** What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?

**Why this lens fits:** Advanced ensemble performance at KS3 requires modelling the performance as a coordinated system — each player's technical and expressive choices must be calibrated to the whole, with stylistic awareness shaping how the system sounds collectively.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- What feedback loops exist in this system?
- Does this model capture all the important interactions, or does it oversimplify?
- What emergent property arises from these components interacting?
- How would removing or adding a component change the system's behaviour?

**Secondary lens:** Patterns — Tonality and harmony are pattern systems — scales, chord functions and harmonic progressions are recurring patterns whose recognition and manipulation underpins both analytical listening and compositional decision-making at KS3.

## Session structure: Performance

### Performance
A sequence building towards a culminating performance in music, drama, or physical activity. Pupils study repertoire or material, develop technical skills through focused practice, rehearse with attention to expression and communication, perform to an audience (real or virtual), and evaluate their own and others' performances.

`repertoire_study` → `technique_development` → `rehearsal` → `performance` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Performance assessed against subject-specific criteria (musical accuracy, expression, dramatic impact, physical skill execution) plus reflective self-evaluation.

**Teacher note:** Use the PERFORMANCE template: analyse repertoire or performance material in terms of style, structure, and technique. Develop skills through targeted exercises and progressively challenging practice. Guide independent and ensemble rehearsal with attention to interpretation, expression, and technical precision. Facilitate critical evaluation of performance using subject-specific criteria.

**KS3 question stems:**
- What stylistic and technical features define this piece or performance?
- How will you target your practice to address your weaknesses?
- What interpretive choices have you made, and how do they affect the performance?
- How would you evaluate your performance against the assessment criteria?

## Music focus

**Genre:** Pop
**Musical elements:** harmony, pitch, rhythm, notation
**Instruments:** keyboard
**Notation level:** staff and chord
**Listening repertoire:** Let It Be - The Beatles, Someone Like You - Adele, Pachelbel Canon in D

## Why this study matters

Keyboard proficiency is the most transferable instrumental skill at KS3 because the keyboard visualises music theory: scales, intervals and chord shapes are physically visible. Pupils learn primary triads (I, IV, V) in C major, then progress to four-chord pop progressions (I-V-vi-IV). The unit builds independence of hands (left-hand bass, right-hand chords or melody), introduces chord symbols and lead sheet notation, and develops the reading skills needed for GCSE composition and set work analysis.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Left hand ignored -- start with simple bass notes, not full chords, in the left hand
2. Fingers collapsing flat -- teach curved finger position from the first lesson
3. Moving too fast to songs before building technique -- dedicate time to hand independence exercises
