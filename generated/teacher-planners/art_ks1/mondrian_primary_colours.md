## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Artists, Craft Makers and Designers (AD-KS1-C006)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Knowledge of practitioners in art, craft and design gives pupils models of creative practice, historical context and cultural diversity. At KS1, pupils learn that different people make different things in different ways and for different purposes, and that these practices have histories and traditions. Comparing the work of different practitioners develops critical and analytical vocabulary.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce a diverse range of artists, craft makers and designers including those from different cultures, genders, historical periods and disciplines. Use high-quality reproductions and, where possible, real objects. Ask pupils to describe what they see, what they think the artist was trying to do, and what connections they can make to their own work. Use artists as starting points for pupils' own making activities. Include craft makers such as potters and textile artists alongside fine artists.

**Key vocabulary:** artist, designer, craft maker, painting, sculpture, drawing, textile, print, illustrator, architect, style, tradition, culture

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often begin with a narrow view of who artists are and what art looks like. Deliberately including diverse examples challenges this. Some pupils may find it difficult to connect what they see in an artist's work to their own making; structured links through projects and activities help build this bridge.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying that different people create art, craft and design in different ways and for different purposes. | Look at these pictures: a painting by an artist, a pot made by a potter, and a chair designed by a designer. How are they different? | Not recognising that craft and design are different from fine art; Thinking art is only paintings hung in galleries |
| **Developing** | Describing the work of specific artists, craft makers or designers studied in class, identifying distinctive features of their work. | What is special about how Andy Goldsworthy makes his art? | Describing what an artist's work looks like without saying what makes it distinctive; Not being able to recall specific details about the artists studied |
| **Expected** | Making connections between the work of artists studied and their own creative work, explaining how an artist's ideas or techniques have influenced their choices. | Create a piece of artwork inspired by an artist you have studied. Explain the connection. | Copying an artist's work directly rather than being inspired by their approach; Making artwork and then retrospectively claiming an artist connection that isn't genuine |

> **Model response (Entry):** *The painting is for looking at on a wall. The pot is for holding things and it looks nice. The chair is for sitting on. Different people make different things for different reasons.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Andy Goldsworthy uses natural materials like leaves, stones, ice and sticks to make sculptures outdoors. His work is special because it uses nature itself as the material and it changes over time — the wind blows it away or it melts. He doesn't use paint or a studio.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *I was inspired by Andy Goldsworthy. I collected autumn leaves and arranged them in a colour gradient from green to yellow to red in a spiral pattern on the grass. Like Goldsworthy, I used only natural materials and worked outdoors. I took a photograph because the wind would blow it away, which is part of the point — art doesn't have to last forever.*

### Secondary concept: Painting (AD-KS1-C003)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Painting involves applying colour to a surface using brushes or other tools to create images and expressions. At KS1, pupils explore colour mixing, brush control and different ways of applying paint. Painting develops understanding of colour as a visual element and builds physical skill and creative confidence.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Using paint freely to explore colour, discovering what happens when colours are mixed and applied in different ways. | Adding too much of one colour so the mix becomes muddy; Not cleaning the brush between colours, accidentally mixing unwanted shades |
| **Developing** | Mixing secondary colours from primaries with control, and beginning to create lighter and darker shades by adding white or black. | Adding too much black, which quickly overwhelms the colour; Not understanding that adding white changes a shade to a tint |
| **Expected** | Applying paint with control using different brush techniques to achieve specific effects, mixing colours purposefully to match or create a mood. | Using paint straight from the pot without mixing to match the observed colours; Using the same brush stroke for everything instead of varying technique |

### Secondary concept: Visual Elements: Colour, Pattern, Texture, Line, Shape, Form and Space (AD-KS1-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

The formal elements of art are the building blocks used by artists to construct visual compositions and communicate meaning. Colour carries emotional associations and creates harmony or contrast. Pattern involves repetition of motifs. Texture describes the surface quality of a material. Line can be expressive, directional or descriptive. Shape is two-dimensional and form is three-dimensional. Space refers to areas within and around forms. Understanding these elements gives pupils both a creative toolkit and a vocabulary for discussing art.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying and naming the visual elements — colour, line, shape — in artwork and the world around them. | Naming colours but not noticing other elements like line, shape or pattern; Using vague descriptions rather than specific element vocabulary |
| **Developing** | Describing how artists use visual elements to create effects, and using these elements purposefully in their own work. | Creating a random arrangement rather than a deliberate repeating pattern; Not considering how colour combinations affect the visual impact |
| **Expected** | Using all the visual elements (colour, pattern, texture, line, shape, form, space) to create artwork with specific intentions, explaining their choices. | Using elements randomly without connecting them to the intended mood or meaning; Not being able to explain why particular choices create particular effects |

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** Early making involves recognising and recreating visual patterns (line, shape, mark) across different surfaces and tools, forming the perceptual vocabulary that underpins all subsequent art-making.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What is the same about these?
- What is different?
- What comes next?
- Can you sort these into groups?

**Secondary lens:** Structure and Function — Pupils learn that each medium — drawing, painting, sculpture — has distinct material properties that determine what it can communicate; understanding how a medium works enables intentional creative choice. The bundling of all three media in one programme requires pupils to notice how structure (the material) constrains and enables function (the expressive outcome).

## Session structure: Creative Response

### Creative Response
A creative arts or writing sequence that develops technique through exposure to exemplary work, guided exploration of techniques, structured planning, independent creation, and peer critique. Balances creative freedom with technical skill development.

`exemplar_exposure` → `technique_exploration` → `planning` → `creating` → `critique`

**Assessment:** Final creative outcome (artwork, design, written piece) accompanied by a reflective evaluation discussing techniques used, influences, and areas for development.

**Teacher note:** Use the CREATIVE RESPONSE template: show children examples of artwork or creative writing that inspire curiosity and excitement. Let them explore materials and techniques through play and experimentation. Support them in planning what they want to make, then give them time to create. Encourage them to talk about what they made and what they like about it.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What do you notice about this artwork or writing?
- What materials or colours will you use?
- Can you tell me about what you have made?
- What is your favourite part? Why?

## Art focus

**Artist:** Piet Mondrian (1872-1944)
**Art movement:** De Stijl
**Medium:** paint
**Techniques:** colour mixing, painting within boundaries, straight line painting
**Visual elements:** colour, line, shape
**Cultural context:** Dutch/European

---

## Why this study matters

Mondrian's Composition with Red, Blue, and Yellow uses only primary colours and straight black lines, making it ideal for teaching colour mixing (primary to secondary) and geometric vocabulary to 5-6 year olds. The strong visual structure means pupils can create successful compositions quickly, building confidence. The geometric simplicity connects naturally to mathematics.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils copy Mondrian's exact grid rather than understanding geometric abstraction -- ensure original compositions
2. Only using poster paint -- try colour mixing with powder paint for richer learning about pigment
3. Treating it as a colouring exercise -- emphasise that Mondrian made deliberate choices about where to put each colour
