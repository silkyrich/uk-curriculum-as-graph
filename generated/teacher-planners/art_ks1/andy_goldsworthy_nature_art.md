## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Artists, Craft Makers and Designers (AD-KS1-C006)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Knowledge of practitioners in art, craft and design gives pupils models of creative practice, historical context and cultural diversity. At KS1, pupils learn that different people make different things in different ways and for different purposes, and that these practices have histories and traditions. Comparing the work of different practitioners develops critical and analytical vocabulary.

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce a diverse range of artists, craft makers and designers including those from different cultures, genders, historical periods and disciplines. Use high-quality reproductions and, where possible, real objects. Ask pupils to describe what they see, what they think the artist was trying to do, and what connections they can make to their own work. Use artists as starting points for pupils' own making activities. Include craft makers such as potters and textile artists alongside fine artists.

**Key vocabulary:** artist, designer, craft maker, painting, sculpture, drawing, textile, print, illustrator, architect, style, tradition, culture

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often begin with a narrow view of who artists are and what art looks like. Deliberately including diverse examples challenges this. Some pupils may find it difficult to connect what they see in an artist's work to their own making; structured links through projects and activities help build this bridge.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying that different people create art, craft and design in different ways and for different purposes. | Look at these pictures: a painting by an artist, a pot made by a potter, and a chair designed by a designer. How are they different? | Not recognising that craft and design are different from fine art; Thinking art is only paintings hung in galleries |
| **Developing** | Describing the work of specific artists, craft makers or designers studied in class, identifying distinctive features of their work. | What is special about how Andy Goldsworthy makes his art? | Describing what an artist's work looks like without saying what makes it distinctive; Not being able to recall specific details about the artists studied |
| **Expected** | Making connections between the work of artists studied and their own creative work, explaining how an artist's ideas or techniques have influenced their choices. | Create a piece of artwork inspired by an artist you have studied. Explain the connection. | Copying an artist's work directly rather than being inspired by their approach; Making artwork and then retrospectively claiming an artist connection that isn't genuine |

> **Model response (Entry):** *The painting is for looking at on a wall. The pot is for holding things and it looks nice. The chair is for sitting on. Different people make different things for different reasons.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Andy Goldsworthy uses natural materials like leaves, stones, ice and sticks to make sculptures outdoors. His work is special because it uses nature itself as the material and it changes over time — the wind blows it away or it melts. He doesn't use paint or a studio.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *I was inspired by Andy Goldsworthy. I collected autumn leaves and arranged them in a colour gradient from green to yellow to red in a spiral pattern on the grass. Like Goldsworthy, I used only natural materials and worked outdoors. I took a photograph because the wind would blow it away, which is part of the point — art doesn't have to last forever.*

### Secondary concept: Materials and Making (AD-KS1-C001)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Understanding that different materials have different properties and can be used in different ways to create artworks and products. Pupils learn that choosing an appropriate material is part of the creative process and that materials can be combined, transformed and manipulated. Experimenting with materials builds both practical skill and creative understanding.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Exploring different materials (paper, card, fabric, clay, found objects) through handling, feeling and simple making activities. | Using only one material instead of exploring and combining; Not noticing or describing the different properties of materials |
| **Developing** | Selecting materials for a purpose, explaining why a particular material is suitable for the intended artwork. | Choosing materials for colour alone without considering texture or form; Not being able to explain why the material matches the purpose |
| **Expected** | Experimenting with how materials can be changed, combined and manipulated to create specific visual or tactile effects, making deliberate creative choices. | Using materials in only their original form without transforming them; Not connecting material choices to the mood or subject of the artwork |

### Secondary concept: Sculpture and Three-Dimensional Work (AD-KS1-C004)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Sculpture involves creating three-dimensional forms using a range of materials such as clay, wire, card, found objects and natural materials. At KS1, pupils explore how forms can be constructed, modelled, assembled and manipulated to create objects that exist in space. Three-dimensional work develops spatial awareness, tactile sensitivity and understanding of form.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Handling and shaping three-dimensional materials (clay, playdough, found objects) to create simple forms. | Making all parts the same size instead of varying proportions; Not joining pieces securely so they fall apart |
| **Developing** | Using modelling, cutting and joining techniques to create three-dimensional work with more control, considering form from multiple viewpoints. | Only considering how the sculpture looks from one angle; Not using proper clay joining techniques (score and slip) |
| **Expected** | Creating sculptures that demonstrate awareness of form, proportion and surface texture, using appropriate materials and techniques to realise their design intention. | Creating a flat representation rather than working in three dimensions; Not adding surface detail and texture to bring the form to life |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Pupils learn that each medium — drawing, painting, sculpture — has distinct material properties that determine what it can communicate; understanding how a medium works enables intentional creative choice. The bundling of all three media in one programme requires pupils to notice how structure (the material) constrains and enables function (the expressive outcome).

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What shape is it? Why do you think it is that shape?
- What job does this part do?
- What would happen if this part were a different shape?
- Can you find something else that does the same job?

**Secondary lens:** Perspective and Interpretation — Comparing artists and designers from different cultural traditions requires pupils to recognise that aesthetic choices are shaped by viewpoint, context and intention — not universal — making perspective the central interpretive demand.

## Session structure: Creative Response

### Creative Response
A creative arts or writing sequence that develops technique through exposure to exemplary work, guided exploration of techniques, structured planning, independent creation, and peer critique. Balances creative freedom with technical skill development.

`exemplar_exposure` → `technique_exploration` → `planning` → `creating` → `critique`

**Assessment:** Final creative outcome (artwork, design, written piece) accompanied by a reflective evaluation discussing techniques used, influences, and areas for development.

**Teacher note:** Use the CREATIVE RESPONSE template: show children examples of artwork or creative writing that inspire curiosity and excitement. Let them explore materials and techniques through play and experimentation. Support them in planning what they want to make, then give them time to create. Encourage them to talk about what they made and what they like about it.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What do you notice about this artwork or writing?
- What materials or colours will you use?
- Can you tell me about what you have made?
- What is your favourite part? Why?

## Why this study matters

Goldsworthy's land art is perfect for KS1 because it uses natural materials children already find fascinating -- leaves, sticks, stones, petals. It teaches that art can be made anywhere with anything, expanding the definition of art beyond paint and paper. The ephemeral nature of the work (it melts, blows away, decays) teaches that the creative process matters as much as the finished product. Working outdoors connects art to science and geography.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Weather dependency -- have a backup indoor plan using collected natural materials
2. Pupils want to take their work home -- teach that photographing the work IS the final product
3. Materials too brittle or wet to arrange -- collect and sort materials before the creative session
