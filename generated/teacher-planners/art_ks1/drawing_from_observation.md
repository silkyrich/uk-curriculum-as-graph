## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Drawing (AD-KS1-C002)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Drawing is a fundamental art skill involving the use of line, mark-making, tone and observation to represent ideas, objects and experiences on a surface. At KS1, pupils develop confidence in mark-making and begin to use drawing purposefully to record, explore and communicate. Drawing underpins many other art and design activities.

**Teaching guidance:** Provide a variety of drawing tools including pencils, crayons, felt tips, chalk and charcoal. Encourage observational drawing from objects, natural forms and still life. Use drawing as a thinking tool - ask pupils to draw their ideas before making. Explore mark-making through rubbings, printing and gestural mark-making. Display pupils' drawings prominently to validate this form of expression.

**Key vocabulary:** line, mark, sketch, observe, detail, outline, shade, tone, pattern, pencil, charcoal

**Common misconceptions:** Young pupils often believe they 'can't draw' if their drawing does not look photorealistic. Teachers should validate expressive and schematic drawing as equally valid. Pupils may focus only on outlines; activities that build awareness of tone and texture extend their drawing vocabulary.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Making marks confidently using different drawing tools (pencils, crayons, chalk, charcoal), exploring what each can do. | Use a pencil, a crayon and charcoal to draw the same object. How do they feel different? | Pressing too hard or too lightly without varying pressure; Using only one tool throughout without exploring alternatives |
| **Developing** | Drawing from observation with increasing accuracy, using line and simple shading to represent what they see. | Draw this plant from observation. Look carefully at the shapes of the leaves and where they join the stem. | Drawing from imagination rather than looking at the actual object; Making all leaves the same size and shape rather than observing differences |
| **Expected** | Using drawing purposefully to explore ideas, record observations or communicate, with control over line, tone, pattern and detail. | Draw a detailed observational study of a shell. Show the texture, pattern and form using different line techniques. | Outlining everything with the same thickness of line instead of varying line quality; Not using shading techniques to show three-dimensional form |

> **Model response (Entry):** *The pencil makes thin, neat lines. The crayon makes thick, waxy marks. The charcoal is soft and smudgy. I like the charcoal because I can blend it with my finger.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *I looked carefully and drew the stem first, then added each leaf where I could see it joining. Some leaves are bigger than others. I used light and dark pencil pressure to show which leaves are in front and which are behind.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *I drew the overall spiral shape first, then added the ridged texture using parallel curved lines that follow the shell's form. I used cross-hatching for the darker areas inside the opening and left the highlights white. The pattern on the surface spirals outward, and I drew this carefully by following the lines I could see.*

### Secondary concept: Visual Elements: Colour, Pattern, Texture, Line, Shape, Form and Space (AD-KS1-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

The formal elements of art are the building blocks used by artists to construct visual compositions and communicate meaning. Colour carries emotional associations and creates harmony or contrast. Pattern involves repetition of motifs. Texture describes the surface quality of a material. Line can be expressive, directional or descriptive. Shape is two-dimensional and form is three-dimensional. Space refers to areas within and around forms. Understanding these elements gives pupils both a creative toolkit and a vocabulary for discussing art.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying and naming the visual elements — colour, line, shape — in artwork and the world around them. | Naming colours but not noticing other elements like line, shape or pattern; Using vague descriptions rather than specific element vocabulary |
| **Developing** | Describing how artists use visual elements to create effects, and using these elements purposefully in their own work. | Creating a random arrangement rather than a deliberate repeating pattern; Not considering how colour combinations affect the visual impact |
| **Expected** | Using all the visual elements (colour, pattern, texture, line, shape, form, space) to create artwork with specific intentions, explaining their choices. | Using elements randomly without connecting them to the intended mood or meaning; Not being able to explain why particular choices create particular effects |

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** Early making involves recognising and recreating visual patterns (line, shape, mark) across different surfaces and tools, forming the perceptual vocabulary that underpins all subsequent art-making.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What is the same about these?
- What is different?
- What comes next?
- Can you sort these into groups?

**Secondary lens:** Structure and Function — Pupils learn that each medium — drawing, painting, sculpture — has distinct material properties that determine what it can communicate; understanding how a medium works enables intentional creative choice. The bundling of all three media in one programme requires pupils to notice how structure (the material) constrains and enables function (the expressive outcome).

## Session structure: Observation Over Time

### Observation Over Time
Systematic observation and recording of changes or patterns over an extended period. Pupils make careful observations, record findings using drawings, measurements, or logs, classify what they observe, and identify patterns or trends. Particularly suited to biological processes and artistic study of the natural world.

`observation` → `recording` → `classifying` → `pattern_identification`

**Assessment:** Observation log or journal with dated entries, annotated drawings or measurements, classification of observations, and summary identifying the key patterns or changes observed.

**Teacher note:** Use the OBSERVATION OVER TIME template: give children something interesting to watch closely — a plant growing, ice melting, or shadows moving. Help them describe what they can see using their senses. Encourage drawing or simple recording of what they notice at different times. Talk about what changed and what stayed the same.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What can you see right now?
- What has changed since last time?
- Can you draw what it looks like today?
- What do you think will happen next?

## Art focus

**Medium:** drawing
**Techniques:** observational drawing, mark-making, shading, use of viewfinders
**Visual elements:** line, shape, tone

---

## Why this study matters

Observational drawing is the most direct way to train the eye-hand connection and build confidence in mark-making. Drawing from real objects -- rather than copying from photographs -- forces pupils to look carefully, make decisions about line and proportion, and develop their own visual language. Starting with natural forms (leaves, shells, fruit) provides organic shapes that are forgiving of imprecision.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils draw what they think something looks like rather than what they see -- use viewfinders to isolate details
2. Rushing to finish -- model slow, careful looking
3. Using only outlines -- teach shading and mark-making variety
