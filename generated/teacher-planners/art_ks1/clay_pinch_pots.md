## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Sculpture and Three-Dimensional Work (AD-KS1-C004)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Sculpture involves creating three-dimensional forms using a range of materials such as clay, wire, card, found objects and natural materials. At KS1, pupils explore how forms can be constructed, modelled, assembled and manipulated to create objects that exist in space. Three-dimensional work develops spatial awareness, tactile sensitivity and understanding of form.

**Teaching guidance:** Use air-drying clay for modelling activities, exploring pinching, rolling, coiling and slab-building techniques. Use reclaimed materials for construction and assemblage projects. Explore natural materials for temporary sculpture and installation. Discuss the work of sculptors such as Barbara Hepworth or Andy Goldsworthy. Help pupils consider how their sculpture will look from multiple viewpoints.

**Key vocabulary:** sculpture, three-dimensional, form, space, model, clay, construct, assemble, texture, surface, relief

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may think of sculpture only as large monuments. Exploring small-scale, handmade and ephemeral sculpture broadens this understanding. Some pupils may struggle with the non-permanence of clay work before firing; discussing transformation and process is important.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Handling and shaping three-dimensional materials (clay, playdough, found objects) to create simple forms. | Use clay to make a simple animal shape. Think about the body, head and legs. | Making all parts the same size instead of varying proportions; Not joining pieces securely so they fall apart |
| **Developing** | Using modelling, cutting and joining techniques to create three-dimensional work with more control, considering form from multiple viewpoints. | Make a clay figure of a person sitting down. Make sure it looks right from the front and the side. | Only considering how the sculpture looks from one angle; Not using proper clay joining techniques (score and slip) |
| **Expected** | Creating sculptures that demonstrate awareness of form, proportion and surface texture, using appropriate materials and techniques to realise their design intention. | Create a sculpture inspired by a natural form (shell, seed pod, leaf). Capture the form, texture and detail. | Creating a flat representation rather than working in three dimensions; Not adding surface detail and texture to bring the form to life |

> **Model response (Entry):** *I rolled a big piece of clay for the body and a smaller ball for the head. I rolled four thin pieces for legs and stuck them on. I pinched two ears on the head.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *I shaped the body sitting on a clay chair. I scored and slipped the joins so they are strong. I checked from the front — you can see the face and hands. From the side, the legs bend at the knees. The figure sits up straight because I made the back thick enough to support it.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *I chose a pinecone. I built the basic cone shape from clay, then added each scale individually, overlapping them like the real pinecone. I used a pointed tool to add texture to each scale. The base is wider and the top comes to a point. I looked at the real pinecone from all angles while I worked to make sure the proportions matched.*

### Secondary concept: Materials and Making (AD-KS1-C001)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Understanding that different materials have different properties and can be used in different ways to create artworks and products. Pupils learn that choosing an appropriate material is part of the creative process and that materials can be combined, transformed and manipulated. Experimenting with materials builds both practical skill and creative understanding.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Exploring different materials (paper, card, fabric, clay, found objects) through handling, feeling and simple making activities. | Using only one material instead of exploring and combining; Not noticing or describing the different properties of materials |
| **Developing** | Selecting materials for a purpose, explaining why a particular material is suitable for the intended artwork. | Choosing materials for colour alone without considering texture or form; Not being able to explain why the material matches the purpose |
| **Expected** | Experimenting with how materials can be changed, combined and manipulated to create specific visual or tactile effects, making deliberate creative choices. | Using materials in only their original form without transforming them; Not connecting material choices to the mood or subject of the artwork |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Pupils learn that each medium — drawing, painting, sculpture — has distinct material properties that determine what it can communicate; understanding how a medium works enables intentional creative choice. The bundling of all three media in one programme requires pupils to notice how structure (the material) constrains and enables function (the expressive outcome).

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What shape is it? Why do you think it is that shape?
- What job does this part do?
- What would happen if this part were a different shape?
- Can you find something else that does the same job?

**Secondary lens:** Patterns — Early making involves recognising and recreating visual patterns (line, shape, mark) across different surfaces and tools, forming the perceptual vocabulary that underpins all subsequent art-making.

## Session structure: Creative Response

### Creative Response
A creative arts or writing sequence that develops technique through exposure to exemplary work, guided exploration of techniques, structured planning, independent creation, and peer critique. Balances creative freedom with technical skill development.

`exemplar_exposure` → `technique_exploration` → `planning` → `creating` → `critique`

**Assessment:** Final creative outcome (artwork, design, written piece) accompanied by a reflective evaluation discussing techniques used, influences, and areas for development.

**Teacher note:** Use the CREATIVE RESPONSE template: show children examples of artwork or creative writing that inspire curiosity and excitement. Let them explore materials and techniques through play and experimentation. Support them in planning what they want to make, then give them time to create. Encourage them to talk about what they made and what they like about it.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What do you notice about this artwork or writing?
- What materials or colours will you use?
- Can you tell me about what you have made?
- What is your favourite part? Why?

## Art focus

**Medium:** clay
**Techniques:** pinch pot, rolling, smoothing, surface decoration, scoring and slipping
**Visual elements:** form, texture, shape

## Why this study matters

Pinch pots are the simplest and most satisfying introduction to three-dimensional work. The technique requires only thumbs and fingers, making it accessible to all pupils. The transformation from a ball of clay to a functional pot is immediate and magical for young children. It teaches that form can be created from a single piece of material through manipulation rather than construction.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Walls too thin and crack -- teach the pinch-and-rotate technique slowly
2. Not keeping the base thick enough -- demonstrate base thickness before starting
3. Rushing to decorate before the form is complete -- separate forming and decorating into different sessions
