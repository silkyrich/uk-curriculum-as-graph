## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Materials and Making (AD-KS1-C001)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Understanding that different materials have different properties and can be used in different ways to create artworks and products. Pupils learn that choosing an appropriate material is part of the creative process and that materials can be combined, transformed and manipulated. Experimenting with materials builds both practical skill and creative understanding.

**Teaching guidance:** Provide a rich range of materials including paper, card, fabric, clay, natural materials and found objects. Set open-ended making tasks that allow pupils to choose materials for a purpose. Discuss why different materials have been chosen and what effect they create. Include collage, modelling, weaving and construction activities alongside drawing and painting.

**Key vocabulary:** material, texture, surface, clay, fabric, paper, card, collage, model, construct, join, shape, form

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils sometimes believe that art is only about drawing or painting. Broadening activities to include three-dimensional and tactile making helps correct this. Some pupils may think they have 'done it wrong' if their work looks different from a model; teachers should emphasise that different outcomes from the same materials are valuable.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Exploring different materials (paper, card, fabric, clay, found objects) through handling, feeling and simple making activities. | Explore these materials: tissue paper, card, felt and clay. Make something using at least two of them. | Using only one material instead of exploring and combining; Not noticing or describing the different properties of materials |
| **Developing** | Selecting materials for a purpose, explaining why a particular material is suitable for the intended artwork. | Choose the best material to make a textured collage of an animal's fur. Explain your choice. | Choosing materials for colour alone without considering texture or form; Not being able to explain why the material matches the purpose |
| **Expected** | Experimenting with how materials can be changed, combined and manipulated to create specific visual or tactile effects, making deliberate creative choices. | Create a mixed-media piece that shows a stormy sea. Choose and combine materials to show the movement and power of the water. | Using materials in only their original form without transforming them; Not connecting material choices to the mood or subject of the artwork |

> **Model response (Entry):** *I scrunched the tissue paper to make a flower shape and stuck it onto card. The tissue paper is soft and you can see through it. The card is stiff and holds the flower up.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *I chose cotton wool for the sheep's body because it looks fluffy like real wool. I used sandpaper for the face because it is rough like a sheep's skin. I chose materials that feel like the real textures.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *I tore blue and white tissue paper into strips and layered them with PVA to create translucent wave shapes. I added string coated in paint to show the spray. I crumpled foil for the rocks. Tearing rather than cutting gives ragged edges that look like waves. The layering makes the sea look deep and the shiny foil contrasts with the soft paper.*

### Secondary concept: Visual Elements: Colour, Pattern, Texture, Line, Shape, Form and Space (AD-KS1-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

The formal elements of art are the building blocks used by artists to construct visual compositions and communicate meaning. Colour carries emotional associations and creates harmony or contrast. Pattern involves repetition of motifs. Texture describes the surface quality of a material. Line can be expressive, directional or descriptive. Shape is two-dimensional and form is three-dimensional. Space refers to areas within and around forms. Understanding these elements gives pupils both a creative toolkit and a vocabulary for discussing art.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying and naming the visual elements — colour, line, shape — in artwork and the world around them. | Naming colours but not noticing other elements like line, shape or pattern; Using vague descriptions rather than specific element vocabulary |
| **Developing** | Describing how artists use visual elements to create effects, and using these elements purposefully in their own work. | Creating a random arrangement rather than a deliberate repeating pattern; Not considering how colour combinations affect the visual impact |
| **Expected** | Using all the visual elements (colour, pattern, texture, line, shape, form, space) to create artwork with specific intentions, explaining their choices. | Using elements randomly without connecting them to the intended mood or meaning; Not being able to explain why particular choices create particular effects |

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** Early making involves recognising and recreating visual patterns (line, shape, mark) across different surfaces and tools, forming the perceptual vocabulary that underpins all subsequent art-making.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What is the same about these?
- What is different?
- What comes next?
- Can you sort these into groups?

**Secondary lens:** Structure and Function — Pupils learn that each medium — drawing, painting, sculpture — has distinct material properties that determine what it can communicate; understanding how a medium works enables intentional creative choice. The bundling of all three media in one programme requires pupils to notice how structure (the material) constrains and enables function (the expressive outcome).

## Session structure: Creative Response

### Creative Response
A creative arts or writing sequence that develops technique through exposure to exemplary work, guided exploration of techniques, structured planning, independent creation, and peer critique. Balances creative freedom with technical skill development.

`exemplar_exposure` → `technique_exploration` → `planning` → `creating` → `critique`

**Assessment:** Final creative outcome (artwork, design, written piece) accompanied by a reflective evaluation discussing techniques used, influences, and areas for development.

**Teacher note:** Use the CREATIVE RESPONSE template: show children examples of artwork or creative writing that inspire curiosity and excitement. Let them explore materials and techniques through play and experimentation. Support them in planning what they want to make, then give them time to create. Encourage them to talk about what they made and what they like about it.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What do you notice about this artwork or writing?
- What materials or colours will you use?
- Can you tell me about what you have made?
- What is your favourite part? Why?

## Art focus

**Medium:** collage
**Techniques:** tearing, cutting, layering, overlapping, arranging
**Visual elements:** texture, colour, pattern

---

## Why this study matters

Collage is an ideal first medium for exploring texture because it combines making decisions about materials with composition. Tearing, cutting and arranging different papers and fabrics teaches pupils that texture is a visual element they can control. It removes the pressure of drawing skill while still developing composition awareness.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils glue everything flat -- encourage overlapping and layering for depth
2. Using only one type of paper -- provide a rich variety of textures
3. Too much glue making work soggy -- teach paste spreading technique
