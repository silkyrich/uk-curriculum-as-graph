## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Drawing (AD-KS1-C002)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Drawing is a fundamental art skill involving the use of line, mark-making, tone and observation to represent ideas, objects and experiences on a surface. At KS1, pupils develop confidence in mark-making and begin to use drawing purposefully to record, explore and communicate. Drawing underpins many other art and design activities.

**Teaching guidance:** Provide a variety of drawing tools including pencils, crayons, felt tips, chalk and charcoal. Encourage observational drawing from objects, natural forms and still life. Use drawing as a thinking tool - ask pupils to draw their ideas before making. Explore mark-making through rubbings, printing and gestural mark-making. Display pupils' drawings prominently to validate this form of expression.

**Key vocabulary:** line, mark, sketch, observe, detail, outline, shade, tone, pattern, pencil, charcoal

**Common misconceptions:** Young pupils often believe they 'can't draw' if their drawing does not look photorealistic. Teachers should validate expressive and schematic drawing as equally valid. Pupils may focus only on outlines; activities that build awareness of tone and texture extend their drawing vocabulary.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Making marks confidently using different drawing tools (pencils, crayons, chalk, charcoal), exploring what each can do. | Use a pencil, a crayon and charcoal to draw the same object. How do they feel different? | Pressing too hard or too lightly without varying pressure; Using only one tool throughout without exploring alternatives |
| **Developing** | Drawing from observation with increasing accuracy, using line and simple shading to represent what they see. | Draw this plant from observation. Look carefully at the shapes of the leaves and where they join the stem. | Drawing from imagination rather than looking at the actual object; Making all leaves the same size and shape rather than observing differences |
| **Expected** | Using drawing purposefully to explore ideas, record observations or communicate, with control over line, tone, pattern and detail. | Draw a detailed observational study of a shell. Show the texture, pattern and form using different line techniques. | Outlining everything with the same thickness of line instead of varying line quality; Not using shading techniques to show three-dimensional form |

> **Model response (Entry):** *The pencil makes thin, neat lines. The crayon makes thick, waxy marks. The charcoal is soft and smudgy. I like the charcoal because I can blend it with my finger.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *I looked carefully and drew the stem first, then added each leaf where I could see it joining. Some leaves are bigger than others. I used light and dark pencil pressure to show which leaves are in front and which are behind.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *I drew the overall spiral shape first, then added the ridged texture using parallel curved lines that follow the shell's form. I used cross-hatching for the darker areas inside the opening and left the highlights white. The pattern on the surface spirals outward, and I drew this carefully by following the lines I could see.*

### Secondary concept: Painting (AD-KS1-C003)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Painting involves applying colour to a surface using brushes or other tools to create images and expressions. At KS1, pupils explore colour mixing, brush control and different ways of applying paint. Painting develops understanding of colour as a visual element and builds physical skill and creative confidence.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Using paint freely to explore colour, discovering what happens when colours are mixed and applied in different ways. | Adding too much of one colour so the mix becomes muddy; Not cleaning the brush between colours, accidentally mixing unwanted shades |
| **Developing** | Mixing secondary colours from primaries with control, and beginning to create lighter and darker shades by adding white or black. | Adding too much black, which quickly overwhelms the colour; Not understanding that adding white changes a shade to a tint |
| **Expected** | Applying paint with control using different brush techniques to achieve specific effects, mixing colours purposefully to match or create a mood. | Using paint straight from the pot without mixing to match the observed colours; Using the same brush stroke for everything instead of varying technique |

### Secondary concept: Visual Elements: Colour, Pattern, Texture, Line, Shape, Form and Space (AD-KS1-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

The formal elements of art are the building blocks used by artists to construct visual compositions and communicate meaning. Colour carries emotional associations and creates harmony or contrast. Pattern involves repetition of motifs. Texture describes the surface quality of a material. Line can be expressive, directional or descriptive. Shape is two-dimensional and form is three-dimensional. Space refers to areas within and around forms. Understanding these elements gives pupils both a creative toolkit and a vocabulary for discussing art.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying and naming the visual elements — colour, line, shape — in artwork and the world around them. | Naming colours but not noticing other elements like line, shape or pattern; Using vague descriptions rather than specific element vocabulary |
| **Developing** | Describing how artists use visual elements to create effects, and using these elements purposefully in their own work. | Creating a random arrangement rather than a deliberate repeating pattern; Not considering how colour combinations affect the visual impact |
| **Expected** | Using all the visual elements (colour, pattern, texture, line, shape, form, space) to create artwork with specific intentions, explaining their choices. | Using elements randomly without connecting them to the intended mood or meaning; Not being able to explain why particular choices create particular effects |

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** Early making involves recognising and recreating visual patterns (line, shape, mark) across different surfaces and tools, forming the perceptual vocabulary that underpins all subsequent art-making.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What is the same about these?
- What is different?
- What comes next?
- Can you sort these into groups?

**Secondary lens:** Structure and Function — Pupils learn that each medium — drawing, painting, sculpture — has distinct material properties that determine what it can communicate; understanding how a medium works enables intentional creative choice. The bundling of all three media in one programme requires pupils to notice how structure (the material) constrains and enables function (the expressive outcome).

## Session structure: Creative Response

### Creative Response
A creative arts or writing sequence that develops technique through exposure to exemplary work, guided exploration of techniques, structured planning, independent creation, and peer critique. Balances creative freedom with technical skill development.

`exemplar_exposure` → `technique_exploration` → `planning` → `creating` → `critique`

**Assessment:** Final creative outcome (artwork, design, written piece) accompanied by a reflective evaluation discussing techniques used, influences, and areas for development.

**Teacher note:** Use the CREATIVE RESPONSE template: show children examples of artwork or creative writing that inspire curiosity and excitement. Let them explore materials and techniques through play and experimentation. Support them in planning what they want to make, then give them time to create. Encourage them to talk about what they made and what they like about it.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What do you notice about this artwork or writing?
- What materials or colours will you use?
- Can you tell me about what you have made?
- What is your favourite part? Why?

## Art focus

**Medium:** drawing, paint
**Techniques:** observational drawing, mirror work, colour mixing for skin tones, proportional drawing
**Visual elements:** line, colour, shape, tone

## Why this study matters

Self-portraits combine observational drawing with identity and belonging -- a natural PSHE cross-curricular link. Pupils look carefully at their own faces in mirrors, developing observation skills while learning about proportion (eyes are halfway down the head, not near the top). Comparing self-portraits across different artists (Picasso, Kahlo, Van Gogh) shows that there is no single correct way to represent a face.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils draw tiny features at the top of a large head -- model facial proportions explicitly
2. All self-portraits look the same -- encourage attention to individual features: hair colour, eye shape, glasses
3. Rushing straight to colour -- do pencil observation first, then paint
