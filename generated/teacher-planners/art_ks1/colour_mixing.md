## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Painting (AD-KS1-C003)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Painting involves applying colour to a surface using brushes or other tools to create images and expressions. At KS1, pupils explore colour mixing, brush control and different ways of applying paint. Painting develops understanding of colour as a visual element and builds physical skill and creative confidence.

**Teaching guidance:** Use powder paint, ready-mixed paint and watercolours. Teach primary colour mixing to create secondary colours and explore tints and shades by adding white and black. Vary brush sizes and types, and also explore painting with sponges, rollers and fingers. Connect painting to observation, imagination and response to the work of artists. Allow experimentation with layering and mark-making with paint.

**Key vocabulary:** colour, mix, primary, secondary, tint, shade, brush, paint, wash, layer, blend, opaque, transparent

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often believe colours cannot be changed once mixed. Systematic colour mixing activities address this. Some pupils may be overly cautious with paint; activities that reward bold mark-making help build confidence. Pupils may not connect paint colour choices to emotional or expressive intent.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Using paint freely to explore colour, discovering what happens when colours are mixed and applied in different ways. | Mix red and yellow paint together. What colour do you get? Try mixing different amounts. | Adding too much of one colour so the mix becomes muddy; Not cleaning the brush between colours, accidentally mixing unwanted shades |
| **Developing** | Mixing secondary colours from primaries with control, and beginning to create lighter and darker shades by adding white or black. | Mix three different shades of green — a light green, a medium green and a dark green. | Adding too much black, which quickly overwhelms the colour; Not understanding that adding white changes a shade to a tint |
| **Expected** | Applying paint with control using different brush techniques to achieve specific effects, mixing colours purposefully to match or create a mood. | Paint a sunset scene. Mix the exact colours you need and use different brush strokes for the sky and the ground. | Using paint straight from the pot without mixing to match the observed colours; Using the same brush stroke for everything instead of varying technique |

> **Model response (Entry):** *When I mixed red and yellow I got orange. More red makes a darker orange, more yellow makes a lighter, yellowy orange.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *I mixed blue and yellow to get medium green. I added white to some to make light green. I added a tiny bit of black to make dark green. I had to add the black very carefully because a little goes a long way.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *I mixed warm oranges and pinks by adding white to red and orange. I used broad, horizontal strokes for the sky to show the bands of colour blending into each other. For the dark silhouette of trees on the ground, I used black with a thin brush and precise strokes. I blended the sky colours while they were still wet so they merged naturally.*

### Secondary concept: Visual Elements: Colour, Pattern, Texture, Line, Shape, Form and Space (AD-KS1-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

The formal elements of art are the building blocks used by artists to construct visual compositions and communicate meaning. Colour carries emotional associations and creates harmony or contrast. Pattern involves repetition of motifs. Texture describes the surface quality of a material. Line can be expressive, directional or descriptive. Shape is two-dimensional and form is three-dimensional. Space refers to areas within and around forms. Understanding these elements gives pupils both a creative toolkit and a vocabulary for discussing art.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying and naming the visual elements — colour, line, shape — in artwork and the world around them. | Naming colours but not noticing other elements like line, shape or pattern; Using vague descriptions rather than specific element vocabulary |
| **Developing** | Describing how artists use visual elements to create effects, and using these elements purposefully in their own work. | Creating a random arrangement rather than a deliberate repeating pattern; Not considering how colour combinations affect the visual impact |
| **Expected** | Using all the visual elements (colour, pattern, texture, line, shape, form, space) to create artwork with specific intentions, explaining their choices. | Using elements randomly without connecting them to the intended mood or meaning; Not being able to explain why particular choices create particular effects |

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** Early making involves recognising and recreating visual patterns (line, shape, mark) across different surfaces and tools, forming the perceptual vocabulary that underpins all subsequent art-making.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What is the same about these?
- What is different?
- What comes next?
- Can you sort these into groups?

**Secondary lens:** Structure and Function — Pupils learn that each medium — drawing, painting, sculpture — has distinct material properties that determine what it can communicate; understanding how a medium works enables intentional creative choice. The bundling of all three media in one programme requires pupils to notice how structure (the material) constrains and enables function (the expressive outcome).

## Session structure: Creative Response

### Creative Response
A creative arts or writing sequence that develops technique through exposure to exemplary work, guided exploration of techniques, structured planning, independent creation, and peer critique. Balances creative freedom with technical skill development.

`exemplar_exposure` → `technique_exploration` → `planning` → `creating` → `critique`

**Assessment:** Final creative outcome (artwork, design, written piece) accompanied by a reflective evaluation discussing techniques used, influences, and areas for development.

**Teacher note:** Use the CREATIVE RESPONSE template: show children examples of artwork or creative writing that inspire curiosity and excitement. Let them explore materials and techniques through play and experimentation. Support them in planning what they want to make, then give them time to create. Encourage them to talk about what they made and what they like about it.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What do you notice about this artwork or writing?
- What materials or colours will you use?
- Can you tell me about what you have made?
- What is your favourite part? Why?

## Art focus

**Medium:** paint
**Techniques:** colour mixing, wet-on-wet, colour wheel construction
**Visual elements:** colour

## Why this study matters

Colour mixing is the foundational practical skill of painting. Pupils need to discover through hands-on experimentation that two primary colours combine to make a secondary colour. This is more effectively learned through making than telling -- the surprise of yellow + blue = green creates memorable learning. Mixing also develops fine motor control and an intuitive understanding of colour relationships that supports all future painting work.

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils mix all colours together into brown -- set clear 'two at a time' rules
2. Using too much paint on the palette -- demonstrate small quantities
3. Not cleaning brushes between colours -- teach the wash-wipe-dip routine
