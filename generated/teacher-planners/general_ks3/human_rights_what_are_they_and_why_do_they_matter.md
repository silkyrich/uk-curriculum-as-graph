### Primary concept: Democracy, Elections and Political Systems (CI-KS34-C003)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Democracy is the system of government in which political authority is derived from and exercised on behalf of the people. In representative democracy, citizens elect representatives who make decisions on their behalf; in direct democracy, citizens vote directly on questions of policy. The UK uses a first-past-the-post system for general elections, in which the candidate with the most votes in each constituency wins, even without an overall majority. Other electoral systems - proportional representation, the alternative vote, the single transferable vote - have different characteristics and are used in different UK elections (Scottish Parliament, Welsh Senedd, London Assembly) and internationally. Understanding different forms of government - liberal democracy, constitutional monarchy, presidential systems, authoritarian government - develops comparative political literacy. At KS4, pupils can evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different democratic systems.

**Teaching guidance:** Simulate elections using different electoral systems with the same votes to demonstrate how the system affects outcomes. Discuss the values underlying different systems: does proportional representation better represent the diversity of views? Does FPTP produce stronger, more stable governments? Study real examples of different democratic systems: compare UK Parliament with the US Congress, the French presidential system, the German Bundestag. Examine what distinguishes liberal democracy from other forms of government. Study non-democratic systems comparatively: how are authoritarian governments different from democracies in their relationship to citizens? Connect to current events: elections, referenda, political movements.

**Key vocabulary:** democracy, election, representative, constituency, proportional representation, first-past-the-post, mandate, government, opposition, parliament, franchise, suffrage, referendum, political party, manifesto

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may assume that all elections work the same way; studying the different systems used in UK elections at different levels reveals the diversity of democratic mechanisms. The concept of a mandate - the democratic authority derived from election - is often misunderstood; a mandate has limits and is subject to parliamentary accountability. Pupils may equate democracy with elections alone; understanding that democratic systems require free press, independent judiciary, protection of civil liberties, and limits on executive power develops a more complete conception of democracy.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify that the UK holds elections and has political parties, but cannot explain how the electoral system works or compare it with alternatives. | How does the UK choose its government? | Not understanding that the UK uses a constituency-based system, not a national popular vote; Confusing voting for a local MP with voting directly for the Prime Minister |
| **Developing** | Can explain how the first-past-the-post system works, identify its advantages and disadvantages, and describe at least one alternative electoral system. | Explain how the first-past-the-post (FPTP) electoral system works and give one advantage and one disadvantage. (4 marks) | Not explaining the constituency basis of the system; Stating advantages or disadvantages without providing evidence |
| **Secure** | Can compare multiple electoral systems analytically, evaluate their consequences for representation and governance, and connect electoral systems to broader questions about democratic quality. | Which electoral system is best for democracy: FPTP, proportional representation, or the additional member system? Construct an argument supporting your choice. (6 marks) | Arguing for one system without explaining the criteria used to evaluate it; Not recognising that the 'best' system depends on what values and outcomes are prioritised |
| **Mastery** | Can critically analyse how electoral systems shape political culture and participation, evaluate the relationship between electoral reform and democratic quality, and connect electoral system debates to contemporary political issues. | Does the UK's electoral system need reform? Evaluate the case for and against changing FPTP, considering both the practical and democratic implications. | Treating electoral reform as a purely technical question without considering its wider implications for political culture; Not engaging with the specific evidence about how FPTP operates in practice |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *People vote for who they want to be in charge. The party that gets the most votes wins and their leader becomes Prime Minister.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *In FPTP, the UK is divided into 650 constituencies, each electing one MP. Voters choose one candidate, and the candidate with the most votes wins — they do not need a majority (over 50%), just more votes than any other candidate. One advantage is that FPTP usually produces a clear winner with a majority government, which can make decisive decisions without needing coalition partners. One disadvantage is that it is disproportionate: a party can win a large share of the national vote but very few seats. In 2015, UKIP won 3.9 million votes (12.6%) but only 1 seat, while the SNP won 1.5 million votes but 56 seats because their votes were concentrated in Scotland.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *The answer depends on what we value most in a democracy. If we prioritise strong, stable government that can implement its manifesto, FPTP is best because it typically produces single-party majority governments with clear mandates. However, this comes at the cost of representativeness: millions of votes for losing candidates have no effect on the composition of Parliament. If we prioritise accurate representation of voter preferences, proportional representation (PR) is best because it allocates seats in proportion to votes, ensuring that smaller parties and minority viewpoints are represented. However, PR often produces coalition governments that may be slower to act and may give disproportionate power to small parties who hold the balance of power. The Additional Member System (AMS), used in the Scottish Parliament, offers a compromise: constituency MPs provide local representation (elected by FPTP) while regional list members (allocated proportionally) correct the disproportionality. AMS balances local accountability with overall fairness. My assessment is that AMS is the best system because it captures the strengths of both FPTP and PR while mitigating their weaknesses. However, the most important point is that no electoral system is objectively 'best' — the choice reflects values about what democracy should prioritise: strong government, accurate representation, voter choice, local accountability, or coalition-building.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *The case for reform is strengthened by declining public trust in politics and falling voter turnout, both of which suggest that the current system is not serving democracy well. Under FPTP, the majority of constituencies are 'safe seats' where the outcome is predetermined, meaning millions of voters know their vote will not affect the result, which may contribute to disengagement. The system consistently produces governments with substantial parliamentary majorities despite winning well under 50% of the national vote — Boris Johnson's 80-seat majority in 2019 was based on 43.6% of votes cast, and only about 29% of the eligible electorate. This raises questions about the democratic mandate of governments that a majority of voters did not support. The case against reform emphasises the practical strengths of FPTP: it produces clear outcomes (usually within hours of polls closing), maintains a direct link between MP and constituency, and avoids the instability associated with coalition government in some PR countries (Italy, Israel, Belgium). The UK's experience with the 2011 AV referendum — in which voters rejected even a modest change by 67.9% to 32.1% — suggests limited public appetite for reform. Furthermore, changing the electoral system would likely transform the entire political landscape in unpredictable ways: FPTP constrains the UK to a broadly two-party system, while PR would likely fragment parties and create a multiparty system with very different dynamics. The strongest argument for reform is democratic principle: a system in which the majority of votes do not contribute to the outcome cannot claim to represent the will of the people. The strongest argument against is pragmatic: the current system, for all its flaws, has provided stable government for centuries and commands public familiarity if not enthusiasm. Any reform must consider not just the system's democratic properties in theory but its likely effects on governance, participation and political culture in practice.*

## Thinking lens: Perspective and Interpretation (primary)

**Key question:** Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?

**Why this lens fits:** Understanding how national, regional, ethnic and religious identities coexist requires pupils to take the perspective of communities whose experience of British society differs from their own, and to interpret 'shared values' as contested constructions rather than fixed givens.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- What contextual factors shaped this perspective?
- How does the author's position affect the reliability of this account?
- Whose perspective is missing from this record, and why does that matter?
- How have interpretations of this event changed over time, and what drove those changes?

**Secondary lens:** Systems and System Models — Social cohesion depends on the interaction of legal frameworks (equality law), civic institutions, cultural practices and shared norms; treating British society as a system helps pupils see how diversity and unity are maintained simultaneously through these intersecting mechanisms.

## Session structure: Research Enquiry

### Research Enquiry
A structured approach to answering questions through secondary research. Pupils formulate a research question, select appropriate sources, take and organise notes, synthesise findings from multiple sources, and present their conclusions. Develops information literacy alongside subject knowledge.

`question` → `source_selection` → `note_taking` → `synthesis` → `presentation`

**Assessment:** Research report or presentation that answers the original question using evidence from multiple sources, with evaluation of source reliability where appropriate.

**Teacher note:** Use the RESEARCH ENQUIRY template: frame a focused research question and guide pupils to select, evaluate, and synthesise information from multiple sources. Expect critical evaluation of source reliability and relevance. Prompt pupils to organise their findings thematically, note areas of agreement and disagreement between sources, and present a coherent synthesis.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How did you select your sources, and what criteria did you use?
- Where do your sources agree, and where do they contradict each other?
- How reliable is each source for answering this specific question?
- How would you synthesise these findings into a coherent answer?

## Why this study matters

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights provide the framework for understanding rights in a democratic society. Pupils examine real case studies where rights have been upheld or violated, developing the ability to apply abstract principles to concrete situations. This connects to RS (religious perspectives on human dignity) and History (how rights were won).

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Presenting rights as absolute without discussing limitations -- rights can conflict with each other
2. Only covering historical examples -- include contemporary rights debates
3. Not distinguishing legal rights from moral rights
