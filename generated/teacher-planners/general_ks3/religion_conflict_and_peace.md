## Session structure: Discussion and Debate

### Discussion and Debate
A structured sequence for exploring contested issues or multiple perspectives. Begins with a stimulus that raises a question or dilemma, builds knowledge through research, develops arguments through structured discussion techniques, captures thinking in writing, and reflects on how views may have changed.

`stimulus` → `research` → `structured_discussion` → `writing` → `reflection`

**Assessment:** Balanced written argument or persuasive piece demonstrating understanding of multiple perspectives, supported by evidence, with a reasoned personal conclusion.

**Teacher note:** Use the DISCUSSION AND DEBATE template: present a substantive question or ethical dilemma. Expect pupils to research different perspectives and prepare evidence-based arguments. Facilitate structured discussion using protocols such as Harkness or four corners. Guide pupils to produce a written response that acknowledges multiple viewpoints and justifies their own position.

**KS3 question stems:**
- What are the strongest arguments on each side of this issue?
- What evidence supports this perspective, and how reliable is it?
- How would you respond to the main counter-argument?
- How has the discussion changed or strengthened your view?

## Why this study matters

The relationship between religion and conflict is one of the most contested topics in public discourse. KS3 pupils need to understand that religion is invoked to justify both violence and peacemaking, and that the relationship is never simple. Case studies (the Crusades, Northern Ireland, Israel-Palestine, Buddhist peacemaking in Myanmar) combined with religious teachings on war and peace (just war theory, pacifism, jihad, ahimsa) develop nuanced understanding. This prepares directly for GCSE themes of peace and conflict.

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Presenting religion as the cause of conflict -- political, economic and ethnic factors are usually primary
2. Oversimplifying jihad as 'holy war' -- teach the distinction between greater jihad (inner struggle) and lesser jihad (defence)
3. Not covering religious peacemakers -- Desmond Tutu, the Dalai Lama, Malala Yousafzai counterbalance the conflict narrative

## Scaffolding and inclusion (Y9)

| Guideline | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Reading level | GCSE Preparation Reader (Lexile 950–1250) |
| Text-to-speech | Available |
| Vocabulary | GCSE-level academic vocabulary. Command words (analyse, evaluate, compare, justify, assess) must be explicitly taught and used correctly. |
| Scaffolding level | Minimal |
| Hint tiers | 3 tiers |
| Session length | 30–50 minutes |
| Feedback tone | Examination Coach |
| Normalize struggle | Yes |
| Example correct feedback | *Full marks — you addressed all three assessment objectives: identification, quotation, and analytical comment on the writer's method.* |
| Example error feedback | *This response would earn 2 of 6 marks. You identified the technique correctly (AO1 ✓) and quoted (AO2 ✓), but your analytical comment describes what happens rather than explaining the effect on the reader — that is the AO3 requirement. Revise the final sentence to explain why the technique is effective.* |
