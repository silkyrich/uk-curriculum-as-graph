## Session structure: Source Enquiry

### Source Enquiry
A disciplinary history enquiry centred on working with primary and secondary sources. Pupils select relevant sources, contextualise them within their historical period, interrogate them for reliability, utility, and bias, cross-reference between sources, interpret what they reveal, and construct an argument based on the evidence.

`source_selection` → `contextualisation` → `interrogation` → `cross_referencing` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Source-based extended writing that demonstrates ability to analyse provenance, cross-reference sources, reach substantiated interpretations, and construct a historical argument.

**Teacher note:** Use the SOURCE ENQUIRY template: provide a range of primary and secondary sources relevant to a focused enquiry question. Guide pupils through contextualisation, interrogation of content and provenance, and systematic cross-referencing. Expect pupils to evaluate the utility and reliability of each source for the specific enquiry, and to construct an evidence-based interpretation.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How useful is this source for our specific enquiry question?
- What does the provenance of this source tell us about its reliability?
- Where do these sources corroborate or contradict each other?
- What interpretation does the balance of evidence support?

## Why this study matters

The Holocaust is a mandatory history topic at KS3, and the RS perspective adds a critical dimension: how do religious believers respond to extreme evil? The Holocaust raises the Problem of Evil in its most acute form -- if God is all-powerful and all-loving, how could the Holocaust happen? Studying Jewish, Christian and secular responses (Elie Wiesel, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Viktor Frankl) develops the ability to engage with the most difficult questions in philosophy and theology.

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Reducing the Holocaust to statistics -- use testimony and personal narratives (age-appropriate) to maintain the human dimension
2. Only covering the religious dimension -- the historical context (antisemitism, Nazi ideology) must be understood first
3. Pupils finding the material emotionally overwhelming -- provide pastoral support and allow space for reflection

## Scaffolding and inclusion (Y9)

| Guideline | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Reading level | GCSE Preparation Reader (Lexile 950–1250) |
| Text-to-speech | Available |
| Vocabulary | GCSE-level academic vocabulary. Command words (analyse, evaluate, compare, justify, assess) must be explicitly taught and used correctly. |
| Scaffolding level | Minimal |
| Hint tiers | 3 tiers |
| Session length | 30–50 minutes |
| Feedback tone | Examination Coach |
| Normalize struggle | Yes |
| Example correct feedback | *Full marks — you addressed all three assessment objectives: identification, quotation, and analytical comment on the writer's method.* |
| Example error feedback | *This response would earn 2 of 6 marks. You identified the technique correctly (AO1 ✓) and quoted (AO2 ✓), but your analytical comment describes what happens rather than explaining the effect on the reader — that is the AO3 requirement. Revise the final sentence to explain why the technique is effective.* |
