## Session structure: Comparison Study

### Comparison Study
A structured comparison of two or more examples, places, periods, or perspectives. Introduces each example with sufficient context, applies a systematic comparison framework, analyses similarities and differences with supporting evidence, and reaches an evaluative conclusion about the significance of those differences.

`introduce_examples` → `systematic_comparison` → `analysis` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Comparative analysis using a structured framework (table, Venn diagram, or essay), demonstrating understanding of both examples and reaching a substantiated evaluative conclusion.

**Teacher note:** Use the COMPARISON STUDY template: introduce the examples with relevant contextual detail and guide pupils to develop their own criteria for comparison. Expect systematic analysis using appropriate frameworks, with attention to both similarities and differences. Prompt pupils to evaluate the significance of the comparison and consider what it reveals about broader patterns or processes.

**KS3 question stems:**
- What criteria will you use for comparison, and why are they appropriate?
- What does this comparison reveal about broader patterns or processes?
- Are the differences more significant than the similarities, or vice versa?
- How might the context explain both the similarities and the differences?

## Why this study matters

Comparing worship across Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Judaism and Buddhism teaches that human beings express their deepest beliefs through diverse practices. Visiting or virtually exploring places of worship (church, mosque, gurdwara, mandir, synagogue, temple) grounds the comparison in lived experience. The key learning is that different practices reflect different theological beliefs -- Islamic salah reflects Tawhid (submission to one God), while Hindu puja reflects bhakti (devotion through relationship with the divine).

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Superficial comparison (they all pray but in different ways) -- push for theological explanations of why practices differ
2. Only covering the 'Big 5' religions -- include Sikhism and Buddhism which are often underrepresented
3. Treating worship as exotic spectacle rather than meaningful practice -- invite guest speakers from faith communities
