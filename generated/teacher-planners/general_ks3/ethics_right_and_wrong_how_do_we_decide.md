## Session structure: Ethical Enquiry

### Ethical Enquiry
A structured approach to exploring moral and ethical questions. Begins with a stimulus that raises a genuine ethical dilemma, gathers diverse perspectives including religious, philosophical, and secular viewpoints, develops reasoning using ethical frameworks, engages in structured discussion, and produces a considered written response.

`stimulus` → `perspective_gathering` → `reasoning` → `discussion` → `written_response`

**Assessment:** Extended writing presenting a balanced exploration of the ethical question, demonstrating understanding of multiple perspectives and ethical frameworks, with a reasoned personal response.

**Teacher note:** Use the ETHICAL ENQUIRY template: present a stimulus that raises a genuine ethical question — a dilemma, case study, or real-world scenario. Guide pupils to identify the ethical issues, gather perspectives from different ethical traditions or stakeholders, and develop their own reasoned position. Facilitate structured discussion and expect a written response that presents reasoning clearly.

**KS3 question stems:**
- What are the ethical issues at stake in this scenario?
- What would different ethical traditions or stakeholders say about this?
- What is your reasoned position, and what principles support it?
- How would you respond to someone who holds the opposite view?

## Why this study matters

This unit introduces ethical frameworks (utilitarian, deontological, virtue ethics, situation ethics) at an accessible level and applies them to real-world moral dilemmas. Pupils learn that 'right and wrong' is not always obvious and that different frameworks produce different answers. Comparing religious moral codes (Ten Commandments, Five Pillars, Eightfold Path, Five Ks) with secular ethical theories develops the evaluative skills required at GCSE.

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Teaching ethics as 'religion says this is wrong' -- religious ethics is more nuanced than rules
2. Moral relativism without challenge -- while respecting different views, some actions can be evaluated against shared principles
3. Dilemmas too extreme (trolley problem only) -- include everyday ethical decisions that pupils actually face

| Example correct feedback | *Your method is correct and your reasoning is sound. The extension question: does this generalise? Try with a different case.* |
| Example error feedback | *Your approach identifies the right method but fails at step 3. The error is [specific]. A complete answer would [what is required].* |
