## Session structure: Comparison Study

### Comparison Study
A structured comparison of two or more examples, places, periods, or perspectives. Introduces each example with sufficient context, applies a systematic comparison framework, analyses similarities and differences with supporting evidence, and reaches an evaluative conclusion about the significance of those differences.

`introduce_examples` → `systematic_comparison` → `analysis` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Comparative analysis using a structured framework (table, Venn diagram, or essay), demonstrating understanding of both examples and reaching a substantiated evaluative conclusion.

**Teacher note:** Use the COMPARISON STUDY template: introduce the examples with relevant contextual detail and guide pupils to develop their own criteria for comparison. Expect systematic analysis using appropriate frameworks, with attention to both similarities and differences. Prompt pupils to evaluate the significance of the comparison and consider what it reveals about broader patterns or processes.

**KS3 question stems:**
- What criteria will you use for comparison, and why are they appropriate?
- What does this comparison reveal about broader patterns or processes?
- Are the differences more significant than the similarities, or vice versa?
- How might the context explain both the similarities and the differences?

## Why this study matters

Pilgrimage is a practice shared across all major world religions but expressed in vastly different ways. Comparing the Hajj (Islam), Lourdes (Christianity), Varanasi (Hinduism), the Golden Temple (Sikhism), and Bodh Gaya (Buddhism) teaches that the same human impulse (journeying to a sacred place for spiritual transformation) is expressed through radically different practices shaped by different beliefs. The geographical dimension (why are these places sacred?) connects naturally to geography.

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Treating pilgrimage as 'religious tourism' -- it is a spiritual practice with deep theological meaning
2. Only covering the physical journey -- the inner spiritual journey is the real purpose
3. Not distinguishing between pilgrimage traditions within a religion -- Catholic and Protestant views on Lourdes differ significantly

| Feedback tone | Academic Critical |
| Normalize struggle | Yes |
| Example correct feedback | *Your method is correct and your reasoning is sound. The extension question: does this generalise? Try with a different case.* |
| Example error feedback | *Your approach identifies the right method but fails at step 3. The error is [specific]. A complete answer would [what is required].* |
