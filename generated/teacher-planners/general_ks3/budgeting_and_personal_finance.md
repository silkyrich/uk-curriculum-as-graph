### Primary concept: Personal Financial Management (CI-KS34-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Financial literacy encompasses the knowledge and skills required to make informed, effective personal financial decisions across the life course. Core concepts include: income (money received from employment, benefits or investments), expenditure (money spent on goods and services), budgeting (planning income and expenditure to meet financial goals and avoid overspending), credit (borrowed money that must be repaid with interest), debt (money owed to creditors), insurance (paying regular premiums to protect against financial risk), saving (setting aside money for future needs) and pensions (saving for retirement income). Financial products - current accounts, savings accounts, credit cards, loans, mortgages - are the instruments through which these concepts are enacted. Understanding public finance - taxation, National Insurance, public spending - connects personal finance to the collective financial decisions of democratic society. At KS4, pupils develop the financial capability to navigate these decisions as adult citizens.

**Teaching guidance:** Ground financial concepts in realistic, relatable scenarios: a young person's first pay slip, a student loan decision, a household budget. Use real financial documents (anonymised) to make abstract concepts concrete. Teach compound interest through calculations that reveal the real cost of credit card debt and the real benefit of long-term saving. Develop pupils' critical awareness of financial product marketing: what are the real costs and risks of 'buy now, pay later' schemes? Connect personal finance to economic concepts: how do interest rates, inflation and employment levels affect personal financial decisions? Use case studies of financial problems (debt, redundancy, unexpected expenses) to develop financial resilience thinking.

**Key vocabulary:** income, expenditure, budget, credit, debt, interest, insurance, savings, pension, investment, tax, National Insurance, financial product, mortgage, compound interest

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often underestimate the real cost of credit because they focus on monthly repayments rather than total repayment including interest; calculating the total cost of a loan reveals the true price of borrowing. The distinction between credit and debt (one is a facility, the other is an obligation) is frequently confused. Pupils may not understand that bank accounts and financial products are not free - the business model of financial services needs explanation to develop informed consumer behaviour. Saving for retirement can seem irrelevant to teenagers; connecting it to compound interest mathematics and the real-world outcomes of starting early versus late makes it more compelling.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify that people earn money and need to manage it, but has limited understanding of specific financial concepts like credit, debt, interest or budgeting. | What does it mean to be 'in debt'? | Not distinguishing between manageable debt (like a mortgage) and problem debt; Not understanding how interest increases the cost of borrowing |
| **Developing** | Can explain basic financial concepts (income, expenditure, credit, debt, interest, tax) and apply them to realistic scenarios, demonstrating understanding of budgeting and financial risk. | Explain why it is important to understand compound interest when using a credit card. (4 marks) | Not understanding the difference between simple and compound interest; Not recognising how minimum payments extend the repayment period |
| **Secure** | Can analyse financial products critically, evaluate the risks and benefits of different financial decisions, connect personal finance to the broader economy (taxation, public spending), and demonstrate financial capability through realistic scenarios. | A friend is considering taking out a 'buy now, pay later' loan to buy a new phone. What advice would you give them, and what financial concepts would you explain? (6 marks) | Not considering the total cost of the purchase including potential interest; Not connecting the specific decision to broader financial capability skills |
| **Mastery** | Can critically evaluate the financial services industry, analyse the relationship between personal finance and public economic policy, and connect financial literacy to broader questions of economic citizenship and inequality. | Why is financial literacy important for citizenship in a democratic society? Consider the relationship between personal finance, taxation and public services. | Treating financial literacy as purely a personal skill without connecting it to civic participation; Not recognising the structural dimension: financial literacy alone cannot overcome economic inequality |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Being in debt means you owe money to someone. You have spent more than you have.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Credit cards charge interest on any balance you do not pay off each month. Compound interest means you pay interest on the interest already charged, not just on the original amount borrowed. For example, if you owe 1,000 at 20% annual interest and make only minimum payments, the interest is calculated on the growing balance each month. After one year, you might owe significantly more than 1,200 because interest has been added to previous interest charges. This is why paying only the minimum payment each month can mean it takes years to pay off the balance, with the total repayment far exceeding the original purchase price. Understanding compound interest is essential for making informed decisions about borrowing.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *I would advise careful consideration of several factors. First, the cost of credit: 'buy now, pay later' schemes often charge 0% interest during an initial period but then apply high interest rates (sometimes 20-40% APR) on any remaining balance. If the phone costs 800 and you miss the interest-free deadline, you could end up paying significantly more than the original price. Second, affordability: can you realistically make the repayments from your regular income? A budget calculation — listing monthly income against all expenses — would reveal whether the repayments are affordable without cutting essential spending. Third, opportunity cost: the money spent on repayments cannot be used for other purposes or saved for emergencies. Financial advisers recommend building an emergency fund before taking on consumer debt. Fourth, alternatives: could you save for several months and buy the phone outright, avoiding any interest? Could you buy a less expensive phone? Fifth, credit record: missing repayments affects your credit score, which determines your ability to borrow in the future (mortgages, car loans). I would explain that 'buy now, pay later' companies profit from people who miss the interest-free deadline, so their business model depends on a proportion of customers paying more than they expected.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Financial literacy is a citizenship issue because economic participation is a fundamental dimension of democratic life, and uninformed financial decisions have consequences that extend beyond the individual. At the personal level, financial literacy protects individuals from exploitation by predatory lenders (payday loans with APRs exceeding 1,000%), enables informed decisions about saving, borrowing and investing, and builds resilience against economic shocks. Financial illiteracy disproportionately affects lower-income groups, meaning it reinforces existing inequality. At the civic level, financial literacy is necessary for informed democratic participation because many of the most important political decisions are economic: how much to tax, how to fund public services, how to regulate financial markets, whether to run a budget deficit. Citizens who cannot evaluate these claims are vulnerable to misleading political arguments. Understanding the tax system (that income tax is progressive, that National Insurance funds the NHS and state pension, that VAT is regressive because it takes a larger proportion of income from poorer people) is essential for making informed voting decisions. Understanding public debt (the difference between the deficit and the national debt, and why governments can sustainably borrow in ways that individuals cannot) prevents misleading household-economy analogies that distort political debate. The most important insight is that financial literacy is not merely a personal skill but a democratic competence: an electorate that cannot evaluate economic arguments is vulnerable to manipulation, and a society where financial capability is unevenly distributed is one where economic power is unequally exercised.*

## Thinking lens: Systems and System Models (primary)

**Key question:** What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?

**Why this lens fits:** Individual financial decisions (saving, borrowing, spending) connect to the wider economic system through taxation, public spending and interest rates; pupils must trace how personal choices aggregate into macroeconomic patterns and how economic conditions in turn shape individual options.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- What feedback loops exist in this system?
- Does this model capture all the important interactions, or does it oversimplify?
- What emergent property arises from these components interacting?
- How would removing or adding a component change the system's behaviour?

**Secondary lens:** Cause and Effect — The practical focus on evaluating financial decisions is explicitly causal — what are the consequences of taking on credit, of not saving for retirement, of different tax policies? — requiring pupils to reason about short and long-term consequences of economic choices.

## Session structure: Practical Application

### Practical Application
A hands-on sequence where pupils apply knowledge and skills to solve a practical problem or create a functional outcome. Begins with a real-world context, builds skills through rehearsal, guides design or planning, supports making or problem-solving, and concludes with evaluation against success criteria.

`context` → `skill_rehearsal` → `design` → `make_or_solve` → `evaluate`

**Assessment:** Practical outcome (solution, product, program) evaluated against defined success criteria, with written or verbal explanation of the process and decisions made.

**Teacher note:** Use the PRACTICAL APPLICATION template: present a realistic problem context that requires pupils to select and apply relevant knowledge and skills. Expect pupils to rehearse key techniques, design a solution with justification, and carry out the task with attention to accuracy and quality. Guide evaluation that considers both the outcome and the effectiveness of their approach.

**KS3 question stems:**
- What knowledge and skills are relevant to this problem, and how do they connect?
- Why did you choose this approach over alternatives?
- How effectively does your solution address the original problem?
- What would you evaluate as the strengths and weaknesses of your approach?

## Why this study matters

Financial literacy is a life skill that many adults report wishing they had learned in school. At KS3, pupils learn budgeting through simulated scenarios: managing a weekly budget, planning for a school trip, understanding income and expenditure. The mathematical skills are simple (addition, subtraction, percentages) but the decision-making framework (needs vs wants, saving vs spending, risk) is sophisticated.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Making it too abstract -- use real-world prices and scenarios
2. Not addressing inequality -- some pupils' families have very different financial circumstances
3. Reducing it to maths -- the citizenship dimension is about financial decisions and their consequences
