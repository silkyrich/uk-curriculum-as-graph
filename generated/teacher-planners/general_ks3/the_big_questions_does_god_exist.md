## Session structure: Discussion and Debate

### Discussion and Debate
A structured sequence for exploring contested issues or multiple perspectives. Begins with a stimulus that raises a question or dilemma, builds knowledge through research, develops arguments through structured discussion techniques, captures thinking in writing, and reflects on how views may have changed.

`stimulus` → `research` → `structured_discussion` → `writing` → `reflection`

**Assessment:** Balanced written argument or persuasive piece demonstrating understanding of multiple perspectives, supported by evidence, with a reasoned personal conclusion.

**Teacher note:** Use the DISCUSSION AND DEBATE template: present a substantive question or ethical dilemma. Expect pupils to research different perspectives and prepare evidence-based arguments. Facilitate structured discussion using protocols such as Harkness or four corners. Guide pupils to produce a written response that acknowledges multiple viewpoints and justifies their own position.

**KS3 question stems:**
- What are the strongest arguments on each side of this issue?
- What evidence supports this perspective, and how reliable is it?
- How would you respond to the main counter-argument?
- How has the discussion changed or strengthened your view?

## Why this study matters

The existence of God is the foundational philosophical question in RS and the one that most engages KS3 pupils. Exploring classical arguments (cosmological, teleological, moral) alongside counter-arguments (Problem of Evil, science and religion debate) develops the analytical and evaluative skills required at GCSE. Pupils encounter genuinely different perspectives (theist, atheist, agnostic) and learn to construct reasoned arguments from evidence rather than assertion.

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Reducing to 'science vs religion' -- many scientists are religious; the relationship is more nuanced than conflict
2. Pupils stating opinions without reasoning -- require evidence and argument structure for every claim
3. Not covering non-Western perspectives on God -- include Hindu, Buddhist and Sikh concepts alongside Abrahamic monotheism

| Normalize struggle | Yes |
| Example correct feedback | *Correct — and the implication is worth noting: if this is true, then [connected consequence] should also hold. Does it?* |
| Example error feedback | *That reasoning has a gap: you assumed [X], but the evidence points the other way because [Y]. Revise your argument in light of that.* |
