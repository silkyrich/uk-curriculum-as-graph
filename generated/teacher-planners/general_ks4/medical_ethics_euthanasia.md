### Primary concept: Religious Pluralism and Interfaith Dialogue (RS-KS4-C004)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Religious pluralism refers to the coexistence of multiple religious traditions within a society, and to the theological question of how different religions relate to each other's claims to truth and salvation. Three theological positions are commonly distinguished: exclusivism (one religion alone has saving truth); inclusivism (one religion is normatively true, but other religions may participate in that truth imperfectly); and pluralism (all major religions are different but equally valid paths to the same ultimate reality or goal). Interfaith dialogue refers to structured conversation between representatives of different religious traditions, aiming at mutual understanding, cooperation and in some cases theological convergence. Issues of religious identity, community cohesion and the limits of tolerance are also addressed in this domain.

**Teaching guidance:** Develop pupils' understanding of the three positions on religious pluralism through specific religious examples: traditional Catholic inclusivism; exclusivist strands in Protestant Christianity and Salafi Islam; philosophical pluralism associated with John Hick. Avoid presenting pluralism as the obviously correct or more enlightened position; all three positions have sophisticated theological defences and genuine challenges. Develop understanding of interfaith dialogue through concrete examples: the Council of Christians and Jews; the Christian-Muslim Forum; Scriptural Reasoning. For examination questions on religious plurality, practise structured responses that acknowledge multiple perspectives without collapsing into relativism. Develop pupils' ability to distinguish between political tolerance (respecting others' rights to hold different beliefs) and theological pluralism (believing all religions are equally valid).

**Key vocabulary:** pluralism, exclusivism, inclusivism, interfaith dialogue, tolerance, religious identity, diversity, secular, ecumenism, truth claim, salvation, enlightenment, community cohesion, relativism, syncretism

**Common misconceptions:** The conflation of religious tolerance (a political commitment) with religious relativism (a theological position) is extremely common; developing the distinction prevents serious misunderstanding of what religious tolerance requires. The assumption that interfaith dialogue necessarily involves compromising one's own beliefs is incorrect; dialogue can be conducted from a position of firm conviction. Students may assume that secular liberal societies are neutral between religious positions, not understanding that secularism itself embodies a specific set of commitments about the proper relationship between religion and public life.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Identifies that different religions exist in the same society and recognises basic terms like pluralism and tolerance, with limited understanding of the theological issues involved. | What is meant by 'religious pluralism'? | Defines pluralism only as a social fact (many religions exist) without recognising it as a theological position (whether multiple religions can be equally true).; Confuses pluralism with secularism, thinking that a pluralist society is one where religion has no role in public life. |
| **Developing** | Explains the three theological positions on religious pluralism (exclusivism, inclusivism, pluralism) with examples, and describes the purpose of interfaith dialogue. | Explain the difference between exclusivism, inclusivism and pluralism, giving a religious example of each. | Presents pluralism as obviously correct and exclusivism as obviously wrong, rather than analysing the theological reasoning behind each position.; Describes the three positions without using any specific religious examples or thinkers to illustrate them. |
| **Secure** | Evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of different positions on religious pluralism, analyses the purpose and challenges of interfaith dialogue, and distinguishes between political tolerance and theological pluralism. | Evaluate whether interfaith dialogue requires giving up the belief that your own religion is the truest. Refer to different Christian perspectives in your answer. | Conflates political tolerance (respecting others' rights to believe differently) with theological pluralism (believing all religions are equally true), which are fundamentally different commitments.; Presents interfaith dialogue as always harmonious, without acknowledging genuine theological disagreements that participants may find irreconcilable. |
| **Mastery** | Critically analyses the philosophical assumptions underlying different positions on religious pluralism, evaluates truth claims across traditions with sophistication, and engages with the tension between religious conviction and pluralist commitments in contemporary society. | 'In a pluralist society, exclusivist religious truth claims are harmful and should not be expressed in public.' Evaluate this statement. | Fails to recognise the paradox that excluding exclusivist claims from public discourse is itself an exclusivist move, which undermines the internal coherence of the argument.; Does not distinguish between the right to hold and express exclusivist beliefs and the use of those beliefs to justify discrimination or coercion — these are fundamentally different issues. |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Religious pluralism means that many different religions exist together in the same society. In Britain, for example, there are Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, Jews, Buddhists and people with no religion all living together.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Exclusivism is the belief that only one religion has the full truth and is the path to salvation. For example, some evangelical Christians believe that only through faith in Jesus Christ can a person be saved (John 14:6 — 'I am the way, the truth and the life'). Inclusivism is the belief that one religion is the fullest expression of truth but that other religions may contain elements of truth. For example, the Catholic Church (since Vatican II) teaches that while the fullness of truth is in Christianity, other religions can contain 'seeds of the Word' and their followers may be saved through God's grace. Pluralism is the belief that all major religions are different but equally valid paths to the same ultimate reality. The philosopher John Hick argued that different religions are like people looking at the same mountain from different sides — each sees a true but partial view.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Interfaith dialogue does not necessarily require abandoning the belief that your own religion is truest. The purpose of dialogue can vary: it may aim at mutual understanding without theological agreement, practical cooperation on shared concerns (poverty, climate change, peace), or deeper theological exchange. An exclusivist Christian might engage in dialogue to bear witness to their faith while learning to understand others' beliefs more accurately — this is dialogue as mission, not compromise. An inclusivist, following the Vatican II document Nostra Aetate, might seek dialogue because they believe God's truth is partially present in other traditions and engagement can deepen everyone's understanding. A pluralist like John Hick would approach dialogue as an encounter between equally valid perspectives, where each participant may be transformed by encountering truth in another tradition. The key distinction is between political tolerance (respecting others' right to hold different beliefs, which all positions can affirm) and theological pluralism (believing all religions are equally true, which only one position affirms). Interfaith dialogue only requires the former, not the latter. The Scriptural Reasoning movement, which brings Jews, Christians and Muslims together to read each other's sacred texts, demonstrates that deep theological engagement is possible without anyone abandoning their own convictions. However, critics argue that meaningful dialogue requires genuine openness to being changed by the encounter, which may be difficult if one enters with the firm conviction that the other is fundamentally wrong.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *This statement reflects a tension at the heart of liberal pluralist societies: how to balance freedom of religious expression with the commitment to equal respect for all citizens. The case for restricting exclusivist truth claims in public rests on several arguments: such claims can marginalise minorities (telling someone their religion is false is inherently disrespectful), they can undermine social cohesion in diverse societies, and they may contribute to discrimination or hostility. From a Rawlsian perspective, public reason in a pluralist democracy should be conducted in terms accessible to all citizens, not in terms that depend on particular religious convictions. However, the statement is problematic for several reasons. First, it is self-contradictory: claiming that exclusivist truth claims should be excluded from public discourse is itself an exclusivist claim about what kinds of speech are legitimate. The philosopher Jurgen Habermas acknowledged this in his later work, arguing that secular citizens must recognise that religious contributions to public discourse may contain important truths that deserve translation rather than exclusion. Second, the historical evidence suggests that suppressing religious expression does not reduce social conflict but drives it underground — France's strict laicite has arguably intensified rather than resolved tensions around Muslim identity. Third, from a religious perspective, the right to proclaim one's faith is fundamental to religious freedom itself; a pluralism that permits only private religious conviction is not genuinely pluralist but covertly secularist. The most defensible position is that exclusivist truth claims are legitimate in public discourse provided they are expressed through reasoned argument rather than coercion, and provided they are accompanied by political tolerance — the recognition that others have the right to hold and express different views. The distinction between 'I believe my religion is true and others are mistaken' (a theological claim) and 'others should not be allowed to practise their religion' (a political claim) is crucial. A mature pluralist society can accommodate the former while firmly rejecting the latter.*

### Secondary concept: Sanctity of Life and Human Dignity (RS-KS4-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

The sanctity of life is the principle that all human life has intrinsic and inviolable value, typically grounded in religious claims about the divine origin or purpose of human life. In Christian, Jewish and Islamic thought, human life is sacred because humans are created in the image of God (imago Dei in Christianity and Judaism; khalifah — stewardship — in Islam). The concept of human dignity is the secular philosophical correlate, grounding the inviolable value of persons in their rational nature (Kantian) or their capacity for experience and relationship. Both principles generate strong prima facie obligations not to take human life and are invoked in ethical debates about abortion, euthanasia, capital punishment, war, genetic engineering and suicide.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Identifies the concept of sanctity of life and states that most religions teach that life is sacred, with limited ability to explain the reasoning or apply the principle. | Presents the sanctity of life as meaning that killing is always wrong in every circumstance, without recognising that most Christian traditions allow exceptions (e.g. just war, self-defence).; Cannot explain why life is considered sacred, stating only that 'it just is' rather than connecting it to theological reasoning about creation or divine purpose. |
| **Developing** | Explains the sanctity of life principle with reference to its theological foundations in at least two traditions, and applies it to at least one ethical issue with some awareness of different religious perspectives. | Presents all religious views as identical ('all religions are against abortion'), ignoring significant differences in reasoning and in the circumstances where exceptions are permitted.; Fails to explain the theological reasoning behind different positions, simply listing what each religion 'says' without analysing why. |
| **Secure** | Analyses the sanctity of life principle alongside alternative frameworks (quality of life, autonomy), evaluates its application to complex ethical issues from multiple religious and secular perspectives, and considers objections and counter-arguments. | Treats sanctity of life and quality of life as simple opposites rather than analysing how they interact and where they might be reconciled.; Ignores the practical safeguarding concerns that religious and secular opponents of euthanasia share — the risk of pressure on vulnerable people to choose death. |
| **Mastery** | Critically evaluates the philosophical coherence and practical implications of sanctity of life and human dignity frameworks, synthesises religious and secular reasoning with nuance, and engages with edge cases that test the limits of these principles. | Accepts the 'incoherence' charge at face value without analysing the sophisticated philosophical frameworks (double effect, just war, prima facie principles) that religious traditions have developed to resolve the apparent contradiction.; Fails to distinguish between a principle being absolute (no exceptions ever) and being prima facie (strong presumption that can be overridden by weighty reasons) — this distinction is essential to the coherence question. |

## Thinking lens: Perspective and Interpretation (primary)

**Key question:** Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?

**Why this lens fits:** Studying major normative ethical theories requires pupils to take each framework seriously on its own terms — understanding why a utilitarian reaches different conclusions about euthanasia from a natural law theorist, and evaluating the internal coherence of each rather than simply comparing outcomes.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- How do power structures determine whose perspective dominates this narrative?
- What are the epistemological limits of interpreting this source?
- How would you position your interpretation within the existing historiographical debate?
- Can two contradictory interpretations both be valid? Under what conditions?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Applying ethical frameworks to sanctity of life issues (abortion, euthanasia, capital punishment) requires pupils to construct structured arguments in which premises from an ethical theory lead logically to a conclusion, and to evaluate whether religious or secular premises are more convincing in each case.

---

## Session structure: Ethical Enquiry

### Ethical Enquiry
A structured approach to exploring moral and ethical questions. Begins with a stimulus that raises a genuine ethical dilemma, gathers diverse perspectives including religious, philosophical, and secular viewpoints, develops reasoning using ethical frameworks, engages in structured discussion, and produces a considered written response.

`stimulus` → `perspective_gathering` → `reasoning` → `discussion` → `written_response`

**Assessment:** Extended writing presenting a balanced exploration of the ethical question, demonstrating understanding of multiple perspectives and ethical frameworks, with a reasoned personal response.

**Teacher note:** Use the ETHICAL ENQUIRY template: present a complex ethical question with genuine philosophical depth. Expect pupils to analyse the issue using formal ethical frameworks — utilitarianism, deontology, virtue ethics, situation ethics — and to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Demand a sustained written response that engages critically with competing positions and constructs a coherent, justified argument.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How would different ethical frameworks analyse this issue, and what conclusions would each reach?
- What are the strengths and weaknesses of applying this ethical theory to this case?
- Where do the ethical frameworks conflict, and how would you resolve the tension?
- How would you construct a sustained ethical argument that addresses the strongest objections?

---

## Why this study matters

Euthanasia is a mandatory thematic study that requires pupils to evaluate competing ethical frameworks. It tests the ability to construct sustained, balanced arguments using both religious teachings (sanctity of life, sovereignty of God, compassion) and secular ethical theories (autonomy, utilitarianism, natural law). The topic generates genuine moral engagement because pupils recognise it as a real-world dilemma.

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Students stating opinions without evidence -- insist on textual/philosophical support for every claim
2. Only covering 'for and against' -- nuance requires distinguishing voluntary, non-voluntary, active, passive
3. Emotional reactions replacing analytical thinking -- validate feelings but redirect to argument
