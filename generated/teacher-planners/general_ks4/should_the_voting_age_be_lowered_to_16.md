## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Active Citizenship and Democratic Participation (CI-KS34-C006)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Active citizenship involves the knowledge, skills and dispositions to participate effectively in democratic life beyond the act of voting. At KS3 and KS4, citizenship education explicitly develops participatory skills: the ability to research issues, construct arguments, engage in debate, understand different perspectives, and take informed action. Understanding how citizens can engage with democratic processes - through petitions, contacting elected representatives, campaigning, community action, volunteering, media engagement - develops political efficacy (the belief that one's actions can make a difference). Community participation and voluntary service develop civic responsibility and build the social capital on which democratic communities depend. The skills of critical thinking, evidence-based argument and constructive debate are both citizenship skills and transferable intellectual capacities.

**Teaching guidance:** Provide genuine opportunities for pupils to engage with real issues and democratic processes, not only simulations. Organise links with local councillors, MPs or community organisations. Support pupils in identifying a real issue in their school or community and researching and proposing a response. Develop debate and discussion skills explicitly: how do you construct and present an argument? How do you engage respectfully with views you disagree with? Practise the practical skills of democratic participation: how do you write to an MP? How does a petition work? Connect to current events and news so that citizenship knowledge is applied to real political situations. Develop the habit of seeking reliable information from multiple sources.

**Key vocabulary:** citizen, participation, democracy, vote, campaign, petition, lobby, volunteer, community, representation, advocacy, engagement, political efficacy, civil society, accountability

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may believe that politics is only for politicians and that ordinary people have no effective voice; studying examples of successful citizen action and community campaigning challenges this belief. The idea that voting is the only form of political participation ignores the many other ways in which citizens can influence policy and public life. Pupils may feel that national and international political issues are too distant to engage with; connecting them to local and school-level issues they can directly influence builds political confidence.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify that voting is important and that citizens can participate in their communities, but has limited knowledge of the specific ways citizens can engage with democratic processes. | How can citizens participate in democracy? | Thinking voting is the only form of democratic participation; Not knowing any specific methods of civic engagement beyond voting |
| **Developing** | Can describe multiple forms of democratic participation (voting, campaigning, petitioning, volunteering, contacting representatives) and explain why participation matters for democratic health. | Describe three ways citizens can participate in democracy beyond voting. (4 marks) | Listing forms of participation without explaining why they are effective; Focusing only on formal political participation without mentioning community engagement |
| **Secure** | Can analyse the barriers to democratic participation, evaluate the effectiveness of different forms of civic action, and explain how active citizenship contributes to democratic health. | Why do some people choose not to vote, and does low voter turnout matter for democracy? (6 marks) | Attributing low turnout to a single cause (e.g. apathy) without recognising the multiple factors involved; Not connecting low turnout to issues of democratic legitimacy and representation |
| **Mastery** | Can critically evaluate different models of citizenship (passive vs active, liberal vs communitarian), assess the effectiveness of civic education, and construct independent arguments about what democratic participation requires in the 21st century. | Is active citizenship a duty or a choice? Evaluate the argument that citizens in a democracy have an obligation to participate beyond simply obeying the law. | Treating the question as having a simple answer without engaging with the philosophical complexity; Not connecting the theoretical argument to practical evidence about what promotes civic engagement |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Citizens can vote in elections and help in their local community.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *First, citizens can contact their elected representatives (MPs, councillors) by letter, email or attending surgeries to raise concerns about issues affecting their community. This is effective because representatives have a duty to respond and can raise issues in Parliament or council meetings. Second, citizens can organise or sign petitions: UK Parliament petitions that reach 100,000 signatures are considered for debate in the House of Commons. Third, citizens can volunteer for community organisations (food banks, youth clubs, environmental groups) that address local needs. Volunteering strengthens communities and demonstrates active citizenship. Other forms include campaigning for political parties, joining pressure groups, attending protests, and engaging in school or workplace democratic processes.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Non-voting has multiple causes. Some people feel their vote will not make a difference, particularly in safe seats where the outcome is predictable. Others feel that no party represents their views, or that politicians are untrustworthy. Practical barriers include registration requirements, polling station accessibility, and the fact that elections are held on weekdays. Young people consistently have the lowest turnout — 47% of 18-24 year olds voted in 2019 compared to 74% of over-65s — which may reflect disengagement, feeling under-represented, or practical barriers. Low turnout matters for democratic legitimacy because a government elected by a minority of eligible voters has a weaker mandate. It also matters for representation: if some groups vote less (young people, ethnic minorities, lower-income groups), their interests receive less political attention, creating a cycle in which under-represented groups feel further alienated. However, some argue that not voting is itself a legitimate democratic choice — a protest against the available options — and that compulsory voting (as in Australia) forces participation without genuine engagement. The most important response to low turnout is to address its causes: making registration automatic, introducing weekend or online voting, improving political education, and ensuring that political parties offer genuine policy choices that give citizens a reason to engage.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *This question touches a fundamental philosophical debate about the nature of citizenship. The communitarian argument (associated with thinkers like Aristotle and Sandel) holds that citizenship involves positive obligations: democracy requires active participants, not passive subjects, and the rights that citizens enjoy (freedom, security, public services) create corresponding duties to contribute to the community that provides them. On this view, a citizen who takes no interest in public life is free-riding on the civic engagement of others: enjoying the benefits of democracy without bearing its costs. Voting, jury service, informed engagement with public issues, and community contribution are not optional extras but essential components of democratic life. The liberal argument (associated with Mill and Rawls) holds that citizenship is primarily about rights: the purpose of democratic government is to protect individual liberty, and the most important obligation is to respect others' rights. Active participation is valuable but cannot be compelled without violating the freedom it is supposed to serve. Forcing people to vote, volunteer or engage undermines the voluntary character that gives participation its democratic meaning. The most productive synthesis recognises that a healthy democracy needs both rights protection and active participation, but that participation is better encouraged than compelled. Civic education, accessible democratic institutions, genuine responsiveness to citizen input, and a political culture that values engagement are more effective than obligations in fostering the active citizenship that democracy needs. The evidence from citizenship education research suggests that young people who experience real participation (school councils with genuine power, community projects with visible outcomes, direct contact with democratic institutions) develop stronger civic identities than those who merely learn about participation in the classroom.*

### Secondary concept: Identity, Diversity and Mutual Respect (CI-KS34-C004)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

British society is characterised by diverse national (English, Scottish, Welsh, Northern Irish, British), regional, religious and ethnic identities that coexist within a shared civic framework. Identity is complex and multiple: individuals hold several identities simultaneously that may relate to place, religion, ethnicity, culture, family background and personal characteristics. Mutual respect and understanding - the commitment to treating people with different identities and beliefs with dignity and to engaging with diverse perspectives - is a foundational principle of democratic citizenship. Understanding diversity requires both factual knowledge of the range of identities and communities present in UK society and attitudinal development: the capacity to empathise, to engage respectfully with difference, and to resist prejudice and discrimination. At KS3 and KS4, citizenship education develops both dimensions.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can recognise that the UK is a diverse country with people from different backgrounds, but has limited vocabulary for discussing identity, diversity or the reasons why mutual respect matters. | Defining diversity only in terms of ethnicity and religion, without considering other dimensions of identity; Not explaining why diversity matters for society |
| **Developing** | Can describe the multiple dimensions of identity (national, ethnic, religious, regional), explain why mutual respect is important for democratic society, and give examples of diversity in UK life. | Confusing respect with agreement (you can respect someone's right to hold a view without agreeing with it); Not giving specific examples of how diversity is expressed in UK society |
| **Secure** | Can analyse the relationship between identity, diversity and social cohesion, evaluate different approaches to managing diversity (multiculturalism, integration, assimilation), and discuss the challenges of maintaining mutual respect in practice. | Presenting multiculturalism and integration as entirely opposed approaches rather than as points on a spectrum; Not acknowledging the real tensions that can exist within diverse communities |
| **Mastery** | Can critically analyse the concept of identity, evaluate how social and political forces shape identity construction, and engage with contemporary debates about diversity, belonging and citizenship with analytical sophistication. | Presenting national identity as either inherently inclusive or inherently exclusive without engaging with the complexity; Not recognising the difference between civic identity (shared values) and ethnic/cultural identity (shared heritage) |

## Thinking lens: Systems and System Models (primary)

**Key question:** What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?

**Why this lens fits:** Comparing electoral systems (FPTP, proportional representation, AV) and different types of democracy requires pupils to model how the rules of a political system generate different outcomes — the same voter preferences produce different results under different systems, illustrating systemic logic.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- What assumptions does this model make, and how do they limit its predictions?
- Are there tipping points where small changes produce large systemic effects?
- How would you choose between two competing models of this system?
- Can this phenomenon be explained by looking at parts alone, or does it require a systems perspective?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Active citizenship skills — researching issues, forming reasoned arguments, campaigning — are applied forms of evidence-to-argument reasoning; pupils must gather evidence on an issue, evaluate its reliability, and construct a persuasive case for action.

## Session structure: Discussion and Debate

### Discussion and Debate
A structured sequence for exploring contested issues or multiple perspectives. Begins with a stimulus that raises a question or dilemma, builds knowledge through research, develops arguments through structured discussion techniques, captures thinking in writing, and reflects on how views may have changed.

`stimulus` → `research` → `structured_discussion` → `writing` → `reflection`

**Assessment:** Balanced written argument or persuasive piece demonstrating understanding of multiple perspectives, supported by evidence, with a reasoned personal conclusion.

**Teacher note:** Use the DISCUSSION AND DEBATE template: frame a complex, contested question with genuine scholarly or ethical disagreement. Expect independent research and preparation of a nuanced position. Facilitate formal discussion or debate with attention to the quality of reasoning and evidence. Demand a sustained written response that critically evaluates competing perspectives and constructs a justified judgement.

**KS4 question stems:**
- What are the underlying assumptions of each position in this debate?
- How would you evaluate the quality of evidence used by each side?
- Where does this debate sit within broader scholarly or ethical discourse?
- How would you construct a sustained argument that addresses the strongest counter-claims?

## Why this study matters

This debate is the most personally relevant democratic question for KS4 students: should THEY have the vote? It requires pupils to construct arguments using evidence (Scottish 16-year-old voting, international comparisons, brain development research, taxation without representation). The topic develops all core Citizenship skills: research, analysis, argument construction, and evaluation.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Students assuming the answer is obviously 'yes' -- challenge them to construct the strongest 'no' argument
2. Anecdotal evidence ('I'm mature enough') replacing analytical argument
3. Not connecting to broader democratic principles -- this is about representation, not maturity
