## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Scriptural Authority and Sources of Moral Guidance (RS-KS4-C003)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Scriptural authority refers to the status and weight given to sacred texts as a source of religious knowledge, moral guidance and spiritual insight. Different religious traditions hold their scriptures in different relationships to divine authority: some traditions regard scripture as the direct, unmediated word of God (Muslim understanding of the Qur'an; some Protestant understandings of the Bible); others regard scripture as divinely inspired but humanly mediated (mainstream Christian view of the Bible); others regard texts as records of enlightened teaching rather than divine revelation (Theravada Buddhism). Beyond scripture, religious moral guidance is drawn from tradition (the accumulated wisdom of the community over time), reason (rational reflection on moral principles) and experience (personal and communal encounter with the divine or the transcendent).

**Teaching guidance:** Teach the concept of scriptural authority carefully, avoiding the assumption that all religions relate to their texts in the same way. Develop pupils' understanding of the hermeneutic question: how should scripture be interpreted? What role do context, tradition, reason and experience play in interpretation? Use specific examples of how different religious communities interpret the same text differently to illustrate the hermeneutic diversity within traditions. For examination questions about sources of authority, develop precise responses that specify the source, explain how it functions as authority, and evaluate the significance and limitations of that source. Develop understanding of the relationship between the four sources (scripture, tradition, reason, experience) as a framework for comparing religious approaches.

**Key vocabulary:** scripture, revelation, inspiration, authority, Qur'an, Bible, Torah, Hadith, tradition, hermeneutics, interpretation, literalist, liberal, contextual, canonical

**Common misconceptions:** The assumption that all religious people read their scriptures literally is incorrect; most religious traditions have rich traditions of allegorical, typological and contextual interpretation. Students may not understand the difference between a text being authoritative (carrying weight in moral reasoning) and being read literally (taken at face value in its plain meaning). The relationship between scripture and tradition is complex in many religious traditions; in Catholicism, for example, tradition is a co-equal source of revelation alongside scripture, which is quite different from the Protestant 'scripture alone' position.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Identifies key sacred texts for at least two religions and states that they are considered authoritative, with limited understanding of how or why. | Name the main sacred text for Christianity and for Islam, and explain one way each is used by believers. | States that all religious people interpret their scripture literally, ignoring the range of approaches to interpretation within traditions.; Confuses the Qur'an (sacred text) with the Hadith (sayings and actions of the Prophet), or the Torah (first five books) with the Talmud (rabbinic commentary). |
| **Developing** | Explains how sacred texts function as sources of authority in at least two religions, with some awareness that traditions differ in how they understand the status of scripture. | Explain the difference between how Muslims and Christians typically understand the authority of their sacred texts. | Presents the Christian view of the Bible as uniform, ignoring that evangelical Christians often hold a much higher view of biblical authority than liberal Christians.; Describes the status of texts without explaining why these differences matter for how believers actually use and interpret them. |
| **Secure** | Analyses how different sources of authority (scripture, tradition, reason, experience) interact within religious traditions, and evaluates the significance and limitations of scriptural authority with reference to specific examples of interpretive disagreement. | Explain why Christians disagree about the authority of the Bible on ethical issues, using a specific example to illustrate your answer. | Presents the disagreement as simply 'some follow the Bible and some don't,' rather than analysing different approaches to interpretation that all claim to take the Bible seriously.; Fails to explain the hermeneutic principle at stake — that the same text can support different conclusions depending on the interpretive framework applied to it. |
| **Mastery** | Critically evaluates the epistemological basis of scriptural authority, analyses how the four sources of authority (scripture, tradition, reason, experience) generate both convergence and conflict within and between traditions, and engages with the hermeneutic challenges of treating ancient texts as contemporary moral guides. | 'Sacred texts cannot provide reliable moral guidance because they were written in a very different time and culture.' Evaluate this statement with reference to at least two religious traditions. | Treats the question as simply about whether scripture is 'outdated,' rather than engaging with the sophisticated hermeneutic traditions that religious communities have developed to address exactly this challenge.; Fails to recognise that the objection applies equally to all historical texts used as moral guides (Aristotle, Kant, Mill), not only to religious scripture. |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *The main sacred text for Christianity is the Bible, which is read in church services and used for personal prayer and guidance. The main sacred text for Islam is the Qur'an, which Muslims believe is the direct word of Allah revealed to Muhammad. Muslims recite it in daily prayers (salah).*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Muslims believe the Qur'an is the direct, unchanged word of Allah, revealed in Arabic to the Prophet Muhammad through the angel Jibril. This means the Qur'an has absolute authority — it is not a human text that can be revised or reinterpreted freely. Christians generally believe the Bible is divinely inspired but written by human authors, which means it reflects both God's message and the historical context in which it was written. This difference matters because it affects how the texts are used: Muslims learn to recite the Qur'an in Arabic and treat the physical text with great respect, while Christians are more likely to interpret the Bible in light of its historical context and to accept that some passages reflect the culture of their time rather than timeless commands.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Christians disagree about biblical authority on ethical issues because they hold different views about the nature of scripture and how it should be interpreted. Conservative evangelical Christians tend to hold that the Bible is the inerrant word of God and that its moral teachings are binding and timeless. Liberal Christians tend to see the Bible as divinely inspired but culturally situated, meaning its moral teachings must be interpreted in light of their historical context. The issue of homosexuality illustrates this clearly: Leviticus 18:22 and Romans 1:26-27 appear to prohibit same-sex relationships, and conservative Christians cite these passages as clear divine commands. Liberal Christians argue that these passages must be understood in their ancient cultural context, that the concept of a committed same-sex relationship did not exist in biblical times, and that the overarching biblical principle of love and inclusion should take precedence over specific prohibitions. The Catholic position adds a further dimension: the Magisterium (teaching authority of the Church) interprets scripture authoritatively, so individual Catholics are expected to follow the Church's interpretation rather than their own reading. This disagreement reveals that the Bible's authority is not self-interpreting — it requires a hermeneutic framework, and which framework is used determines what the text is understood to teach.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *This statement raises a genuine hermeneutic challenge: if sacred texts reflect the assumptions and norms of their historical context, their moral authority may be limited to that context. The Bible permits slavery (Ephesians 6:5), prescribes the death penalty for adultery (Leviticus 20:10), and assigns women subordinate roles (1 Timothy 2:12) — positions that virtually all contemporary Christians reject. Similarly, some Qur'anic passages on women's testimony and inheritance reflect 7th-century Arabian social structures. If these culturally embedded teachings are no longer binding, the question arises: on what basis do believers decide which teachings are timeless and which are culturally contingent? However, the statement is too sweeping for several reasons. First, religious traditions have always engaged in interpretive development: the Jewish tradition of midrash and Talmudic commentary represents two millennia of reinterpreting Torah for new contexts, and the principle that 'the Torah was not given to angels' (it must be applicable to real human life) has driven continuous reinterpretation. The Qur'anic concept of maqasid al-shariah (the higher objectives of Islamic law — preservation of life, intellect, faith, lineage and property) provides an internal framework for distinguishing between the specific rulings of a historical context and the underlying ethical principles they were intended to serve. Second, the claim that cultural distance makes moral guidance unreliable proves too much: by the same logic, we should dismiss Aristotle's virtue ethics or Kant's categorical imperative, which are also products of specific cultural contexts. The real question is not whether texts are culturally situated — all texts are — but whether they contain principles that transcend their original context. The philosophical hermeneutics of Gadamer suggests that the 'fusion of horizons' between text and reader is precisely where meaning is generated, making cultural distance productive rather than simply problematic. On balance, sacred texts cannot be applied mechanically as moral rulebooks, but they can provide reliable moral guidance when read within a mature interpretive tradition that distinguishes enduring principles from contingent applications.*

### Secondary concept: Ethical Frameworks and Moral Reasoning (RS-KS4-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Ethical frameworks are systematic approaches to moral reasoning that provide structured methods for determining right and wrong action. Key frameworks studied at GCSE include: Utilitarianism (the greatest happiness principle — the right action maximises overall welfare); Natural Law (moral rules derived from human nature and rational reflection, associated with Aquinas and used in Catholic moral theology); Situation Ethics (the primacy of agape — unconditional love — over fixed rules, associated with Joseph Fletcher); and Kantian ethics (the categorical imperative — act only on principles you could will to be universal laws). Religious ethical approaches draw on and extend these frameworks, often with the addition of divine command, scriptural guidance and community tradition as sources of moral authority.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Identifies basic ethical frameworks by name and gives simple definitions, with limited ability to apply them to specific issues. | Confuses Utilitarianism with selfishness or personal happiness, rather than understanding it as maximising overall welfare.; Cannot distinguish between different ethical frameworks, treating all non-religious ethics as the same thing. |
| **Developing** | Explains at least two ethical frameworks with some accuracy and applies them to a moral issue, showing awareness of how religious and secular approaches differ. | Applies frameworks inconsistently, e.g. using consequentialist reasoning when explaining Natural Law.; Presents religious ethics as simply 'following rules' without acknowledging the reasoned principles behind religious moral positions. |
| **Secure** | Applies multiple ethical frameworks accurately and consistently to contemporary issues, compares religious and secular approaches with precision, and evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of each framework. | Confuses Situation Ethics (a principled framework based on agape) with moral relativism (the view that there are no moral truths), failing to recognise that Fletcher's approach does have an absolute principle.; Evaluates frameworks only in the abstract without applying them to concrete medical ethics cases, which weakens the analysis. |
| **Mastery** | Critically analyses the philosophical foundations and internal coherence of ethical frameworks, evaluates their adequacy for complex contemporary issues from multiple perspectives, and constructs sophisticated arguments that synthesise religious and secular reasoning. | Treats the question as a simple yes/no rather than analysing which aspects of religious and secular ethics are compatible and which genuinely diverge.; Fails to engage with specific philosophical arguments (e.g. Natural Law's rationalist foundations, Rawls's overlapping consensus) that complicate the incompatibility thesis. |

## Thinking lens: Perspective and Interpretation (primary)

**Key question:** Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?

**Why this lens fits:** Understanding lived religious practice requires pupils to view rituals, rites of passage and devotional acts from the insider perspective of practitioners, rather than as external observers, which is the defining skill of phenomenological religious studies — grasping what these practices mean to those who perform them.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- How do power structures determine whose perspective dominates this narrative?
- What are the epistemological limits of interpreting this source?
- How would you position your interpretation within the existing historiographical debate?
- Can two contradictory interpretations both be valid? Under what conditions?

**Secondary lens:** Continuity and Change Over Time — Analysing how tradition and authority shape practice across denominations requires pupils to examine what has changed (liturgical reform, contemporary expressions of faith) and what has persisted (core sacraments, canonical texts) within and across religious traditions over time.

## Session structure: Comparison Study

### Comparison Study
A structured comparison of two or more examples, places, periods, or perspectives. Introduces each example with sufficient context, applies a systematic comparison framework, analyses similarities and differences with supporting evidence, and reaches an evaluative conclusion about the significance of those differences.

`introduce_examples` → `systematic_comparison` → `analysis` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Comparative analysis using a structured framework (table, Venn diagram, or essay), demonstrating understanding of both examples and reaching a substantiated evaluative conclusion.

**Teacher note:** Use the COMPARISON STUDY template: frame the comparison within a theoretical or conceptual framework. Expect independent identification of appropriate criteria and rigorous analysis using subject-specific terminology. Demand an evaluative conclusion that assesses the extent of similarity or difference and its significance, considering limitations of the comparative method itself.

**KS4 question stems:**
- What theoretical framework underpins your choice of comparison criteria?
- To what extent do the similarities outweigh the differences, and what does this suggest?
- What are the limitations of comparing these two cases?
- How would you construct a sustained evaluative argument from this comparison?

## Why this study matters

Christian worship varies enormously across denominations -- from Catholic Mass with Eucharist to Quaker silent worship. Studying this diversity teaches that Christianity is not monolithic and that the same beliefs produce different practices depending on tradition, interpretation, and emphasis. The sacraments (particularly baptism and Eucharist) demonstrate how theology is enacted in ritual.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Only covering one denomination -- the comparison between Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox practices is essential
2. Describing rituals without explaining their theological meaning
3. Students confusing 'sacrament' with 'ceremony' -- sacraments have specific theological significance
