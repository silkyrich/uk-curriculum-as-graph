### Primary concept: Sanctity of Life and Human Dignity (RS-KS4-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

The sanctity of life is the principle that all human life has intrinsic and inviolable value, typically grounded in religious claims about the divine origin or purpose of human life. In Christian, Jewish and Islamic thought, human life is sacred because humans are created in the image of God (imago Dei in Christianity and Judaism; khalifah — stewardship — in Islam). The concept of human dignity is the secular philosophical correlate, grounding the inviolable value of persons in their rational nature (Kantian) or their capacity for experience and relationship. Both principles generate strong prima facie obligations not to take human life and are invoked in ethical debates about abortion, euthanasia, capital punishment, war, genetic engineering and suicide.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach the sanctity of life principle with precision: what does it claim, on what grounds, and what does it require? Develop understanding of how the principle functions differently in different religious traditions and how it generates different conclusions in specific cases. Apply the principle to a range of ethical case studies: how does the sanctity of life principle bear on the ethics of abortion (from when does human life acquire full value?)? On euthanasia (does sanctity of life require that life be prolonged in all circumstances?)? On war (how can the killing of enemies be reconciled with the sanctity of their lives?)? For examination responses, develop the ability to explain the principle, apply it to a specific issue, consider objections (including religious objections from within the tradition) and evaluate its adequacy.

**Key vocabulary:** sanctity of life, imago Dei, human dignity, inviolable, intrinsic value, abortion, euthanasia, capital punishment, stewardship, quality of life, personhood, viability, proportionality, just war, rights

**Common misconceptions:** Students often present the sanctity of life as an absolute prohibition on killing in all circumstances, not understanding that most religious traditions have developed sophisticated accounts of exceptional circumstances (just war theory; capital punishment in some traditions; self-defence). The distinction between the sanctity of life as a principle and quality of life as an alternative framework for medical ethics is frequently confused; both principles need to be understood on their own terms. The assumption that the sanctity of life principle is exclusively religious ignores the secular philosophical tradition of human dignity grounded in Kantian ethics and human rights theory.

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Identifies the concept of sanctity of life and states that most religions teach that life is sacred, with limited ability to explain the reasoning or apply the principle. | What do Christians mean by the 'sanctity of life'? | Presents the sanctity of life as meaning that killing is always wrong in every circumstance, without recognising that most Christian traditions allow exceptions (e.g. just war, self-defence).; Cannot explain why life is considered sacred, stating only that 'it just is' rather than connecting it to theological reasoning about creation or divine purpose. |
| **Developing** | Explains the sanctity of life principle with reference to its theological foundations in at least two traditions, and applies it to at least one ethical issue with some awareness of different religious perspectives. | Explain how the sanctity of life principle is used in religious arguments about abortion. Refer to at least two religious perspectives. | Presents all religious views as identical ('all religions are against abortion'), ignoring significant differences in reasoning and in the circumstances where exceptions are permitted.; Fails to explain the theological reasoning behind different positions, simply listing what each religion 'says' without analysing why. |
| **Secure** | Analyses the sanctity of life principle alongside alternative frameworks (quality of life, autonomy), evaluates its application to complex ethical issues from multiple religious and secular perspectives, and considers objections and counter-arguments. | Evaluate whether the sanctity of life principle or the quality of life principle should be given more weight in decisions about euthanasia. Refer to religious and non-religious arguments. | Treats sanctity of life and quality of life as simple opposites rather than analysing how they interact and where they might be reconciled.; Ignores the practical safeguarding concerns that religious and secular opponents of euthanasia share — the risk of pressure on vulnerable people to choose death. |
| **Mastery** | Critically evaluates the philosophical coherence and practical implications of sanctity of life and human dignity frameworks, synthesises religious and secular reasoning with nuance, and engages with edge cases that test the limits of these principles. | 'The concept of the sanctity of life is incoherent because religious traditions that affirm it also permit killing in certain circumstances.' Evaluate this statement. | Accepts the 'incoherence' charge at face value without analysing the sophisticated philosophical frameworks (double effect, just war, prima facie principles) that religious traditions have developed to resolve the apparent contradiction.; Fails to distinguish between a principle being absolute (no exceptions ever) and being prima facie (strong presumption that can be overridden by weighty reasons) — this distinction is essential to the coherence question. |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Christians believe that all human life is sacred and special because humans are created by God in His image (imago Dei). This means that life should be protected and that it is wrong to take a human life.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *The sanctity of life principle teaches that human life has special value given by God and must be protected. Christians who hold a strong sanctity of life position, particularly Catholics, argue that life begins at conception and therefore abortion is always wrong because it destroys a life created by God. The Catholic Church teaches that the embryo has a soul from the moment of conception and that abortion violates the commandment 'thou shalt not kill.' However, some Protestant Christians, such as members of the Church of England, take a more nuanced view: while they affirm the sanctity of life, they accept that in some circumstances (such as risk to the mother's life or pregnancy resulting from rape) abortion may be the lesser of two evils. In Islam, most scholars agree that ensoulment occurs at 120 days after conception (based on a hadith), so abortion before this point may be permitted for serious reasons, though it is generally discouraged. After ensoulment, abortion is haram (forbidden) except to save the mother's life, because her established life takes precedence.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *The sanctity of life principle holds that life has intrinsic value regardless of its condition, which means it is wrong to intentionally end a life even when a person is suffering. The Catholic doctrine of double effect allows pain relief that may shorten life (because the intention is to relieve suffering, not to cause death) but prohibits direct euthanasia. This position has the strength of providing a clear, non-negotiable boundary that protects vulnerable people from pressure to end their lives. However, the quality of life principle argues that the value of life is connected to the experience of living — that a life of unrelievable suffering, with no prospect of improvement, may have lost the qualities that make it worth living. Secular ethicists like Peter Singer argue that respect for personal autonomy means individuals should be able to choose when their suffering becomes unbearable. From a utilitarian perspective, prolonging a life of suffering when the person wishes to die creates unnecessary harm. Some liberal Christians and Reform Jews argue that compassion — a core religious value — may sometimes require helping someone to die peacefully rather than insisting they endure prolonged suffering. The strongest religious counter-argument is that suffering can have redemptive meaning (Catholic theology of suffering) and that God alone has the right to determine when life ends. The practical concern is also significant: if quality of life becomes the criterion, who determines what quality is 'sufficient'? The experience of disabled people who report high life satisfaction despite conditions that others assume make life not worth living shows that quality of life judgements are subjective and potentially discriminatory. On balance, neither principle alone is adequate: the sanctity of life provides essential protections, but in extreme cases where a competent adult faces terminal suffering, the quality of life principle adds a necessary dimension of compassion and respect for autonomy.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *This statement identifies a genuine tension: if life is sacred and inviolable, how can the same traditions that affirm this also justify killing in war (just war theory in Christianity and Islam), capital punishment (historically affirmed in Judaism, Christianity and Islam), and self-defence? The charge of incoherence has force if the sanctity of life is understood as an absolute prohibition on taking life. However, the major religious traditions have never understood it in this simplistically absolute way. The Catholic tradition distinguishes between the direct, intentional killing of the innocent (which is always prohibited) and other forms of killing that may be justified under specific conditions. The principle of double effect allows actions whose primary intention is good (e.g. defending the innocent in war) even if death results as a foreseen but unintended side effect. Just war theory (developed by Augustine and Aquinas) does not abandon the sanctity of life but argues that sometimes protecting innocent life requires the use of lethal force against aggressors. In Islamic jurisprudence, the concept of darura (necessity) allows exceptions to general prohibitions in extreme circumstances, while the framework of jihad (in its military sense) is governed by strict conditions that aim to minimise harm to non-combatants. The more sophisticated understanding is that the sanctity of life is not a simple rule ('never kill') but a prima facie principle — it creates a strong presumption against taking life that can only be overridden by weighty moral reasons, typically involving the protection of other lives. This is philosophically coherent: medical ethics operates similarly with the principle of non-maleficence (do no harm), which generates a strong presumption against harmful interventions but allows them when the alternative is worse. The real test of coherence is whether the exceptions are principled (governed by clear criteria that preserve the spirit of the original principle) or ad hoc (invoked whenever convenient). The careful development of just war criteria, the principle of double effect, and the conditions for legitimate self-defence suggest principled exception-making rather than incoherence. Where traditions do become vulnerable to the charge of incoherence is when the exceptions expand to undermine the principle — as critics of capital punishment argue has happened in traditions that affirm sanctity of life while permitting the state to execute offenders.*

### Secondary concept: Religious Practices, Worship and Sources of Authority (RS-KS4-C006)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Religious practices are the ritualised actions, ceremonies, forms of worship and rites of passage through which believers express and enact their faith, build community and mark significant life events. These include collective worship (prayer, services, ceremonies), individual devotional practices (meditation, private prayer, fasting), rites of passage (birth ceremonies, coming of age rituals, marriage, death rites) and seasonal observances and festivals. Sources of authority are the texts, institutions, leaders and traditions that give guidance on how adherents should believe and practise: these may include sacred scriptures, religious leaders (priests, imams, rabbis), councils and institutions, and the accumulated tradition of the faith community. At GCSE, pupils study practices and authority in at least two religions, comparing how different traditions approach these questions and examining the diversity of practice within each tradition.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Identifies key practices and forms of worship in at least two religions and names basic sources of authority, with limited understanding of the connection between belief and practice. | Describes practices without any reference to the beliefs that give them meaning, e.g. describing the Eucharist without mentioning Jesus's Last Supper or the concept of sacrifice.; Presents practices as uniform across a religion, e.g. describing all Christian worship as if it follows the same pattern, ignoring differences between Catholic Mass, Quaker silence and Pentecostal worship. |
| **Developing** | Explains how specific practices express theological beliefs and describes the role of different sources of authority in governing practice, with some awareness of diversity within traditions. | Describes the mechanics of salah (times, movements, direction) without explaining how these connect to theological beliefs about God, community and submission.; Treats salah as identical for all Muslims, without acknowledging differences in practice between Sunni and Shi'a traditions (e.g. combining prayers, use of a turbah). |
| **Secure** | Analyses the relationship between belief, practice and authority within and between traditions, evaluates the significance of practices for believers and communities, and accounts for diversity of practice within traditions with specific examples. | Treats the belief-practice relationship as identical across all religions, rather than recognising that different traditions weight this relationship differently.; Discusses practices and beliefs in isolation rather than analysing how they interact — e.g. how performing salah reinforces belief in Tawhid, or how belief in Christ's presence shapes the experience of the Eucharist. |
| **Mastery** | Critically evaluates how sources of authority operate within traditions, including how authority is contested and negotiated, analyses the significance of practice in both theological and sociological terms, and engages with the question of how traditions maintain continuity while adapting to contemporary contexts. | Treats authority as either completely fixed or completely fluid, rather than analysing the dynamic between settled practice and ongoing contestation within specific communities and traditions.; Discusses authority in purely abstract terms without grounding the analysis in specific historical examples of how authority has been challenged, defended and renegotiated. |

## Thinking lens: Perspective and Interpretation (primary)

**Key question:** Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?

**Why this lens fits:** Theological attitudes to pluralism (exclusivism, inclusivism, pluralism) are themselves competing interpretations of religious truth and the status of other traditions; pupils must evaluate these positions from within each tradition's own frame of reference, which is a sophisticated application of perspective-taking in religious thought.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- How do power structures determine whose perspective dominates this narrative?
- What are the epistemological limits of interpreting this source?
- How would you position your interpretation within the existing historiographical debate?
- Can two contradictory interpretations both be valid? Under what conditions?

**Secondary lens:** Systems and System Models — Evaluating the contribution of interfaith dialogue to social cohesion requires pupils to model how multiple faith traditions, secular institutions and legal frameworks interact within a democratic society — understanding pluralism as a social system with feedback between religious communities, civic institutions and public discourse.

## Session structure: Discussion and Debate

### Discussion and Debate
A structured sequence for exploring contested issues or multiple perspectives. Begins with a stimulus that raises a question or dilemma, builds knowledge through research, develops arguments through structured discussion techniques, captures thinking in writing, and reflects on how views may have changed.

`stimulus` → `research` → `structured_discussion` → `writing` → `reflection`

**Assessment:** Balanced written argument or persuasive piece demonstrating understanding of multiple perspectives, supported by evidence, with a reasoned personal conclusion.

**Teacher note:** Use the DISCUSSION AND DEBATE template: frame a complex, contested question with genuine scholarly or ethical disagreement. Expect independent research and preparation of a nuanced position. Facilitate formal discussion or debate with attention to the quality of reasoning and evidence. Demand a sustained written response that critically evaluates competing perspectives and constructs a justified judgement.

**KS4 question stems:**
- What are the underlying assumptions of each position in this debate?
- How would you evaluate the quality of evidence used by each side?
- Where does this debate sit within broader scholarly or ethical discourse?
- How would you construct a sustained argument that addresses the strongest counter-claims?

## Why this study matters

The religion-science relationship is perennially engaging for KS4 pupils. The creation vs evolution debate is the entry point, but the deeper learning is about the nature of different truth claims: scientific truth (empirical, testable, provisional) vs religious truth (revealed, faith-based, absolute). Understanding that many scientists are religious, and many religious people accept evolution, prevents the false binary.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Presenting it as religion vs science -- many traditions see no conflict
2. Only covering creationism -- include intelligent design, theistic evolution, and day-age interpretations
3. Students picking a 'side' without understanding the nuances of each position
