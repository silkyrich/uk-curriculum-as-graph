This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Transactional Writing (ENL-KS4-C010)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Writing that fulfils a real-world communicative purpose — letters, articles, reports, speeches, reviews, essays — adapted to specific audience, purpose, form and context. Transactional writing requires students to understand and apply the conventions of non-fiction genres.

**Teaching guidance:** Transactional writing is assessed in Paper 2. Students must apply the conventions of the specified form: a report has a title, sections, subheadings and formal register; a speech has an opening address, rhetorical structure and acknowledgement of the audience; an article has a headline, engaging opening and journalist's voice. Teach students to make form, audience and purpose decisions within the first few lines and sustain them throughout. Higher-grade transactional writing shows sophisticated control of register — adjusting formality within a piece rather than maintaining a flat tone throughout.

**Key vocabulary:** transactional, letter, article, speech, report, review, essay, convention, register, formality, layout, headline, subheading, audience, purpose, inform, argue, advise

**Common misconceptions:** Students often write 'essay' responses to tasks specifying a different form (e.g., a speech or a letter). Students may forget form conventions mid-piece, abandoning a speech's direct address after the opening. Some students write in a uniformly formal or uniformly informal register rather than modulating between them appropriately.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can write for a specified purpose (e.g. a letter, a report) but does not consistently follow the conventions of the required form, and register may be inappropriate. | Write a letter to the editor of a local newspaper arguing that a new skate park should be built in your area. | Writing an informal appeal rather than a formal argument with evidence and structure; Not following letter conventions consistently (greeting, formal register, sign-off) |
| **Developing** | Follows the conventions of the required form (letter, article, speech, report) and maintains an appropriate register, though the argument structure may be simple and the range of techniques limited. | Write a report for your school council recommending changes to the school canteen. Follow the conventions of a formal report. | Mixing conventions from different forms (e.g. including rhetorical questions in a formal report); Following the form conventions but not developing the content beyond simple statements |
| **Secure** | Writes confidently in a range of transactional forms, maintaining the conventions of the form throughout, adapting register to audience and purpose, and constructing well-organised arguments supported by evidence and rhetorical technique. | Write a review of a book, film, exhibition or performance for a quality magazine aimed at adults. Your review should demonstrate the conventions of the form and a confident critical voice. | Writing a summary of the plot rather than a critical evaluation of the work; Adopting an overly formal or impersonal tone that lacks the confident critical voice expected in a quality review |
| **Mastery** | Writes transactional pieces with a distinctive voice, sophisticated control of form conventions, and the ability to modulate register within the piece for deliberate rhetorical effect. | Write an opinion piece for a broadsheet newspaper arguing that public libraries are more important now than ever. Your writing should demonstrate mastery of form, audience and rhetorical technique. | Writing a polished but impersonal argument that lacks the distinctive voice and controlled passion of the best opinion journalism; Using rhetorical devices as decoration rather than integrating them into the logical and emotional structure of the argument |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Dear editor, I think we should have a skate park because there is nothing for young people to do. We are always getting told off for hanging around in the town centre but there is nowhere else to go. A skate park would be good because it would give us something to do. Please build one.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Report: Proposed Changes to the School Canteen. Prepared by: [Name], Year 11 Student Representative. 1. Introduction: This report examines current student satisfaction with the school canteen and proposes three changes. It is based on a survey of 120 students across Years 7-11 conducted in January 2026. 2. Findings: 68% of respondents said the canteen does not offer enough healthy options. 54% said queuing time exceeds 15 minutes, meaning they lose a significant portion of their lunch break. 31% said they bring packed lunch specifically to avoid the queue. 3. Recommendations: (a) Introduce a pre-ordering system via the school app to reduce queuing. (b) Add a salad bar with daily rotation. (c) Extend opening hours by 10 minutes to reduce peak congestion. 4. Conclusion: These changes would improve student satisfaction, reduce food waste, and support the school's healthy eating policy.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Review: 'Small Island' by Andrea Levy -- Headline Books, 2004. There are novels that teach you history, and there are novels that make you feel it. 'Small Island' does both, and it does so with a warmth and structural elegance that belies the brutality of its subject. Levy weaves four narrative voices across two timelines -- wartime London and 1948 post-Windrush Britain -- to explore immigration, race, class and the gap between the Britain that the Empire promised and the Britain that immigrants actually found. What makes the novel exceptional is not its subject (the Windrush story has been told before) but its method. By giving equal narrative weight to Hortense (Jamaican, proud, disappointed) and Queenie (English, pragmatic, quietly radical), Levy refuses the simplistic framing of hero and villain. Neither woman is reducible to her circumstances. Hortense's snobbery is infuriating and completely understandable. Queenie's casual racism coexists with genuine kindness. It is this moral complexity that elevates the novel above a history lesson. The prose is deceptively simple -- Levy writes with the clarity of someone who has revised until every unnecessary word is gone -- and the structural decision to alternate voices creates a rhythm of anticipation and revelation that drives the reader forward. If the novel has a weakness, it is Gilbert's voice, which occasionally drifts into a jocularity that feels performative, as though he is narrating for an audience rather than to himself. But this is a minor flaw in an otherwise masterful work. Essential reading.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *In Defence of the Quiet Room -- The closure of a library never makes the front page. It is not dramatic enough. There is no fire, no flood, no scandal. Just a notice on a door, a stack of returned books, and a silence that used to be purposeful becoming a silence that is merely empty. Since 2010, over 800 public libraries have closed in the UK. The statistic is familiar. What is less familiar -- because it is harder to quantify -- is what disappears with them. A library is not a building full of books. If it were, we would not need them: the internet has more books than any library could hold, and most of them are free. What a library offers -- and what no digital platform has replicated -- is structured serendipity: the experience of looking for one thing and finding another, guided by proximity, by a librarian's recommendation, by the accident of what the previous borrower left on the return trolley. It is the teenager who came in for a graphic novel and left with a poetry collection. The retired man who came for the newspaper and stayed for the reading group. The mother who came for the baby rhyme-time session and found, in the twenty minutes of adult conversation that followed, the first moment of her week that was entirely her own. These are not quantifiable outcomes. They will never appear in a cost-benefit analysis. But they are the reason that communities fight for their libraries with a ferocity that surprises politicians, who tend to assume that anything free must be undervalued. The case for libraries is not nostalgic. It is urgent. In an information ecosystem designed to confirm what you already believe, a library is one of the last public spaces that organises knowledge by subject rather than by algorithm, that places unfamiliar ideas next to familiar ones without asking which you prefer. It does not track your reading habits, sell your data or recommend what you already like. It simply offers. And in that simplicity -- that radical, old-fashioned, increasingly rare simplicity -- lies something we cannot afford to lose.*

### Secondary concept: Audience, Purpose and Form (ENL-KS4-C007)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Understanding the relationship between the intended audience of a piece of writing, its purpose (to argue, inform, persuade, describe, narrate, entertain), and the form it takes (letter, speech, article, review, narrative). Writers adapt all aspects of their writing — vocabulary, tone, structure, register — to serve audience, purpose and form.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Writes with a general sense of audience (e.g. knows to be more formal for a letter to a headteacher) but does not consistently adapt tone, vocabulary or structure to match the demands of the task. | Using informal register ('rubbish', 'loads of') in a formal letter without recognising the mismatch; Not sustaining the letter form throughout -- forgetting conventions like formal sign-off |
| **Developing** | Demonstrates awareness of audience, purpose and form and makes deliberate choices to adapt writing accordingly, though the adaptation may be inconsistent or over-simplified. | Maintaining a formal tone throughout without varying it for rhetorical effect; Following the conventions of one form (e.g. article with headline) but losing the audience-awareness within the body of the text |
| **Secure** | Adapts tone, register, vocabulary and structural conventions confidently and consistently to match audience, purpose and form, demonstrating awareness of how these three elements interact. | Adopting a formal speech register that sounds artificial when addressing peers; Forgetting to use spoken-language features (direct address, rhetorical questions, varied pacing) that distinguish a speech from an essay |
| **Mastery** | Controls audience, purpose and form with sophisticated precision, modulating register within a piece for deliberate effect and demonstrating critical awareness of how writing conventions shape the reader's response. | Maintaining a single tone throughout rather than modulating register for rhetorical variety (serious argument, concession, analogy, direct address); Using sophisticated vocabulary without ensuring it serves clarity and effect rather than mere display |

### Secondary concept: Rhetorical Devices and Persuasion (ENL-KS4-C008)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The deliberate use of language techniques to persuade, convince or move an audience. Rhetorical devices include direct address, rhetorical questions, anaphora, tricolon, hyperbole, emotive language, counter-argument and rebuttal, and appeals to logos, ethos and pathos.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can use basic persuasive techniques (e.g. rhetorical questions, emotive language) but deploys them without clear purpose or integration into a coherent argument. | Stacking rhetorical devices without connecting them to a logical argument; Using emotive language so heavily that the writing loses credibility |
| **Developing** | Uses a range of rhetorical devices with some awareness of their purpose and integrates them into a recognisable argument structure, though the argument may lack subtlety or counter-argument. | Using tricolon and anaphora without varying the techniques across the piece; Acknowledging a counter-argument only to dismiss it immediately rather than engaging with it seriously |
| **Secure** | Deploys a varied repertoire of rhetorical devices purposefully and effectively, integrating them into a coherent and well-structured argument that anticipates and addresses counter-arguments. | Deploying devices mechanically rather than allowing them to emerge from the argument's logic; Not varying the pacing -- alternating between longer analytical passages and shorter punchy ones creates more effective persuasion |
| **Mastery** | Uses rhetorical devices with precision and restraint, integrating them seamlessly into a sophisticated and multi-layered argument that anticipates the audience's resistance, makes strategic concessions, and builds towards a compelling conclusion. | Relying on a single rhetorical register throughout rather than modulating between concession, assertion, evidence and appeal; Making the argument one-sided -- the most persuasive writing acknowledges the strongest counter-argument and engages with it honestly |

### Secondary concept: Sentence Structure and Syntax for Effect (ENL-KS4-C013)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The ability to consciously vary sentence structures — simple, compound, complex and compound-complex — to create pacing, emphasis, rhythm and reader engagement. Students should understand how syntax choices (fronted adverbials, passive voice, embedded clauses, short sentences for impact) function as deliberate craft choices.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Writes mostly in simple and compound sentences, with limited variation in sentence openings and occasional errors in complex sentence construction. | Varying sentence length without varying sentence structure -- a short sentence and a long sentence that both begin 'subject + verb' is not genuine structural variety; Attempting complex sentences but creating run-on sentences or comma splices |
| **Developing** | Uses a range of sentence structures including complex sentences with subordinate clauses, and begins to vary sentence openings (fronted adverbials, participial phrases), though the variety may feel mechanical rather than purposeful. | Using fronted adverbials and participial openers so frequently that they become a new kind of monotony; Varying sentence structures for the sake of variety without considering which structure best serves the meaning |
| **Secure** | Selects sentence structures deliberately to create specific effects -- short sentences for impact, complex sentences for nuance, fragments for dramatic emphasis -- and can explain why specific syntactic choices are effective in both their own writing and published texts. | Explaining what sentence structures do in general terms ('short sentences create tension') without analysing why that specific short sentence in that specific context creates that specific effect; Writing effectively in one register (e.g. complex, literary prose) but not demonstrating the ability to control contrasting registers |
| **Mastery** | Deploys syntax as a fully integrated element of style, using sentence structure not just for variety but as a meaning-making tool that reinforces content, controls pacing, and positions the reader, with the same analytical precision applied to both reading and writing. | Analysing sentence structure in isolation from content -- syntactic analysis must always connect form to meaning; Imitating a syntactic technique without adapting it to a different purpose, producing pastiche rather than original application |

### Secondary concept: Vocabulary Range and Precision (ENL-KS4-C014)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The ability to choose vocabulary that is precise, varied and appropriate to purpose and context, demonstrating a wide lexical range. Vocabulary choices should be evaluated in reading contexts and deployed deliberately in writing.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Uses a basic vocabulary that is adequate for communication but lacks precision, variety or awareness of register, with frequent repetition of common words. | Replacing common words with longer words that are not necessarily more precise ('utilise' instead of 'use' does not improve precision); Not considering whether the replacement word fits the register and tone of the writing |
| **Developing** | Selects vocabulary with increasing precision and awareness of connotation, uses some subject-specific terminology in analytical writing, and avoids obvious repetition. | Discussing vocabulary choices at the level of 'positive' and 'negative' connotations without specifying what associations the word activates; Using sophisticated vocabulary in analysis ('the writer juxtaposes') but not in creative writing, or vice versa |
| **Secure** | Deploys vocabulary with consistent precision in both analytical and creative writing, demonstrating awareness of denotation, connotation and register, and using lexical choices to create specific effects. | Achieving precise vocabulary in creative writing but reverting to generic analytical vocabulary ('effective', 'powerful', 'creates an atmosphere'); Using sophisticated vocabulary inconsistently -- a precise word choice followed by several vague ones undermines the overall effect |
| **Mastery** | Demonstrates exceptional lexical range and precision in all forms of writing, selecting vocabulary that operates on multiple levels simultaneously and creating effects that depend on the reader's sensitivity to nuance, connotation and semantic field. | Analysing vocabulary at a single level (denotation or connotation) without exploring how the same word operates across multiple registers; Selecting vocabulary for sophistication rather than precision -- the best word is not always the most complex one |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Narrative and descriptive writing with craft requires pupils to make deliberate structural choices (narrative arc, descriptive sequence, sentence variety) that serve the function of sustaining the reader's interest and creating a specific imaginative effect.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- How do structural features at different scales interact to produce this function?
- What structural constraints limit what this system can do?
- Why have unrelated organisms evolved similar structures for similar functions?
- How would you apply structure-function analysis to improve this design?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Rhetorical devices, persuasive techniques and transactional writing forms are all tools for constructing arguments adapted to audience — the cognitive demand is selecting the most effective evidence and rhetorical strategies for the specific persuasive task.

---

## Session structure: Writer's Workshop

### Writer's Workshop
A process-writing sequence that develops pupils as independent writers. Studies a mentor text to identify craft techniques, practises those techniques in isolation, plans an original piece, drafts with attention to audience and purpose, engages in peer review for feedback, revises and edits, and publishes the final piece.

`mentor_text` → `technique_identification` → `planning` → `drafting` → `peer_review` → `editing` → `publication`

**Assessment:** Final published piece demonstrating identified craft techniques, with writing portfolio showing development through the drafting and revision process.

**Teacher note:** Use the WRITER'S WORKSHOP template: analyse a mentor text at a sophisticated level, examining the relationship between technique, purpose, and audience. Expect independent and purposeful drafting that demonstrates control of a range of techniques. Facilitate critical peer review and self-editing focused on precision, style, and the overall quality of written communication. Develop exam-standard writing that meets GCSE assessment objectives for accuracy, impact, and crafted expression.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does the mentor text balance technique with authenticity and voice?
- What range of techniques have you deployed, and how effectively do they serve your purpose?
- How would you evaluate the quality of your writing against GCSE assessment objectives?
- What final revisions would elevate your writing from competent to compelling?

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Non Fiction
**Features to teach:** direct address (rhetorical questions, imperatives, inclusive pronouns), tricolon and anaphora for emphasis, structural signposting (opening hook, logical argument, emotive close), register shift (formal persuasion with controlled informality), counter-argument and rebuttal

**Writing outcome:** Write a speech (450-600 words) arguing for or against a proposition, using rhetorical devices, structural techniques, and appropriate register for a specific audience

**Literary terms:** rhetoric, anaphora, tricolon, hyperbole, direct address, imperative, modal verb

---

## Genre

- **Transactional:** Purpose-driven non-fiction forms written for a specific audience and context. The KS3-KS4 progression from KS2 persuasion and discussion: at GCSE, transactional writing encompasses all non-fiction forms (letter, article, speech, review, report) and is assessed on audience awareness, register control, and rhetorical effectiveness. The most frequently examined writing form on GCSE Language Paper 2.

---

## Why this study matters

Speech writing is the most frequently examined transactional form on GCSE English Language Paper 2. It requires students to combine persuasive technique, structural control, and audience awareness in a timed condition. Explicit teaching of rhetorical devices (tricolon, anaphora, direct address) gives students a transferable toolkit they can deploy in articles, letters, and reviews too.

## Sequencing

**Leads to:** Transactional Writing: Article and Letter

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Opening with 'Hello, my name is...' instead of a hook
2. Rhetorical questions overused as the only persuasive technique
3. No structural logic — arguments presented as a list rather than a building case
4. Register too informal for the specified audience
