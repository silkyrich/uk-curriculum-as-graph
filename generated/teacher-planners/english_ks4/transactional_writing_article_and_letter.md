This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Transactional Writing (ENL-KS4-C010)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Writing that fulfils a real-world communicative purpose — letters, articles, reports, speeches, reviews, essays — adapted to specific audience, purpose, form and context. Transactional writing requires students to understand and apply the conventions of non-fiction genres.

**Teaching guidance:** Transactional writing is assessed in Paper 2. Students must apply the conventions of the specified form: a report has a title, sections, subheadings and formal register; a speech has an opening address, rhetorical structure and acknowledgement of the audience; an article has a headline, engaging opening and journalist's voice. Teach students to make form, audience and purpose decisions within the first few lines and sustain them throughout. Higher-grade transactional writing shows sophisticated control of register — adjusting formality within a piece rather than maintaining a flat tone throughout.

**Key vocabulary:** transactional, letter, article, speech, report, review, essay, convention, register, formality, layout, headline, subheading, audience, purpose, inform, argue, advise

**Common misconceptions:** Students often write 'essay' responses to tasks specifying a different form (e.g., a speech or a letter). Students may forget form conventions mid-piece, abandoning a speech's direct address after the opening. Some students write in a uniformly formal or uniformly informal register rather than modulating between them appropriately.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can write for a specified purpose (e.g. a letter, a report) but does not consistently follow the conventions of the required form, and register may be inappropriate. | Write a letter to the editor of a local newspaper arguing that a new skate park should be built in your area. | Writing an informal appeal rather than a formal argument with evidence and structure; Not following letter conventions consistently (greeting, formal register, sign-off) |
| **Developing** | Follows the conventions of the required form (letter, article, speech, report) and maintains an appropriate register, though the argument structure may be simple and the range of techniques limited. | Write a report for your school council recommending changes to the school canteen. Follow the conventions of a formal report. | Mixing conventions from different forms (e.g. including rhetorical questions in a formal report); Following the form conventions but not developing the content beyond simple statements |
| **Secure** | Writes confidently in a range of transactional forms, maintaining the conventions of the form throughout, adapting register to audience and purpose, and constructing well-organised arguments supported by evidence and rhetorical technique. | Write a review of a book, film, exhibition or performance for a quality magazine aimed at adults. Your review should demonstrate the conventions of the form and a confident critical voice. | Writing a summary of the plot rather than a critical evaluation of the work; Adopting an overly formal or impersonal tone that lacks the confident critical voice expected in a quality review |
| **Mastery** | Writes transactional pieces with a distinctive voice, sophisticated control of form conventions, and the ability to modulate register within the piece for deliberate rhetorical effect. | Write an opinion piece for a broadsheet newspaper arguing that public libraries are more important now than ever. Your writing should demonstrate mastery of form, audience and rhetorical technique. | Writing a polished but impersonal argument that lacks the distinctive voice and controlled passion of the best opinion journalism; Using rhetorical devices as decoration rather than integrating them into the logical and emotional structure of the argument |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Dear editor, I think we should have a skate park because there is nothing for young people to do. We are always getting told off for hanging around in the town centre but there is nowhere else to go. A skate park would be good because it would give us something to do. Please build one.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Report: Proposed Changes to the School Canteen. Prepared by: [Name], Year 11 Student Representative. 1. Introduction: This report examines current student satisfaction with the school canteen and proposes three changes. It is based on a survey of 120 students across Years 7-11 conducted in January 2026. 2. Findings: 68% of respondents said the canteen does not offer enough healthy options. 54% said queuing time exceeds 15 minutes, meaning they lose a significant portion of their lunch break. 31% said they bring packed lunch specifically to avoid the queue. 3. Recommendations: (a) Introduce a pre-ordering system via the school app to reduce queuing. (b) Add a salad bar with daily rotation. (c) Extend opening hours by 10 minutes to reduce peak congestion. 4. Conclusion: These changes would improve student satisfaction, reduce food waste, and support the school's healthy eating policy.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Review: 'Small Island' by Andrea Levy -- Headline Books, 2004. There are novels that teach you history, and there are novels that make you feel it. 'Small Island' does both, and it does so with a warmth and structural elegance that belies the brutality of its subject. Levy weaves four narrative voices across two timelines -- wartime London and 1948 post-Windrush Britain -- to explore immigration, race, class and the gap between the Britain that the Empire promised and the Britain that immigrants actually found. What makes the novel exceptional is not its subject (the Windrush story has been told before) but its method. By giving equal narrative weight to Hortense (Jamaican, proud, disappointed) and Queenie (English, pragmatic, quietly radical), Levy refuses the simplistic framing of hero and villain. Neither woman is reducible to her circumstances. Hortense's snobbery is infuriating and completely understandable. Queenie's casual racism coexists with genuine kindness. It is this moral complexity that elevates the novel above a history lesson. The prose is deceptively simple -- Levy writes with the clarity of someone who has revised until every unnecessary word is gone -- and the structural decision to alternate voices creates a rhythm of anticipation and revelation that drives the reader forward. If the novel has a weakness, it is Gilbert's voice, which occasionally drifts into a jocularity that feels performative, as though he is narrating for an audience rather than to himself. But this is a minor flaw in an otherwise masterful work. Essential reading.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *In Defence of the Quiet Room -- The closure of a library never makes the front page. It is not dramatic enough. There is no fire, no flood, no scandal. Just a notice on a door, a stack of returned books, and a silence that used to be purposeful becoming a silence that is merely empty. Since 2010, over 800 public libraries have closed in the UK. The statistic is familiar. What is less familiar -- because it is harder to quantify -- is what disappears with them. A library is not a building full of books. If it were, we would not need them: the internet has more books than any library could hold, and most of them are free. What a library offers -- and what no digital platform has replicated -- is structured serendipity: the experience of looking for one thing and finding another, guided by proximity, by a librarian's recommendation, by the accident of what the previous borrower left on the return trolley. It is the teenager who came in for a graphic novel and left with a poetry collection. The retired man who came for the newspaper and stayed for the reading group. The mother who came for the baby rhyme-time session and found, in the twenty minutes of adult conversation that followed, the first moment of her week that was entirely her own. These are not quantifiable outcomes. They will never appear in a cost-benefit analysis. But they are the reason that communities fight for their libraries with a ferocity that surprises politicians, who tend to assume that anything free must be undervalued. The case for libraries is not nostalgic. It is urgent. In an information ecosystem designed to confirm what you already believe, a library is one of the last public spaces that organises knowledge by subject rather than by algorithm, that places unfamiliar ideas next to familiar ones without asking which you prefer. It does not track your reading habits, sell your data or recommend what you already like. It simply offers. And in that simplicity -- that radical, old-fashioned, increasingly rare simplicity -- lies something we cannot afford to lose.*

### Secondary concept: Audience, Purpose and Form (ENL-KS4-C007)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Understanding the relationship between the intended audience of a piece of writing, its purpose (to argue, inform, persuade, describe, narrate, entertain), and the form it takes (letter, speech, article, review, narrative). Writers adapt all aspects of their writing — vocabulary, tone, structure, register — to serve audience, purpose and form.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Writes with a general sense of audience (e.g. knows to be more formal for a letter to a headteacher) but does not consistently adapt tone, vocabulary or structure to match the demands of the task. | Using informal register ('rubbish', 'loads of') in a formal letter without recognising the mismatch; Not sustaining the letter form throughout -- forgetting conventions like formal sign-off |
| **Developing** | Demonstrates awareness of audience, purpose and form and makes deliberate choices to adapt writing accordingly, though the adaptation may be inconsistent or over-simplified. | Maintaining a formal tone throughout without varying it for rhetorical effect; Following the conventions of one form (e.g. article with headline) but losing the audience-awareness within the body of the text |
| **Secure** | Adapts tone, register, vocabulary and structural conventions confidently and consistently to match audience, purpose and form, demonstrating awareness of how these three elements interact. | Adopting a formal speech register that sounds artificial when addressing peers; Forgetting to use spoken-language features (direct address, rhetorical questions, varied pacing) that distinguish a speech from an essay |
| **Mastery** | Controls audience, purpose and form with sophisticated precision, modulating register within a piece for deliberate effect and demonstrating critical awareness of how writing conventions shape the reader's response. | Maintaining a single tone throughout rather than modulating register for rhetorical variety (serious argument, concession, analogy, direct address); Using sophisticated vocabulary without ensuring it serves clarity and effect rather than mere display |

### Secondary concept: Rhetorical Devices and Persuasion (ENL-KS4-C008)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The deliberate use of language techniques to persuade, convince or move an audience. Rhetorical devices include direct address, rhetorical questions, anaphora, tricolon, hyperbole, emotive language, counter-argument and rebuttal, and appeals to logos, ethos and pathos.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can use basic persuasive techniques (e.g. rhetorical questions, emotive language) but deploys them without clear purpose or integration into a coherent argument. | Stacking rhetorical devices without connecting them to a logical argument; Using emotive language so heavily that the writing loses credibility |
| **Developing** | Uses a range of rhetorical devices with some awareness of their purpose and integrates them into a recognisable argument structure, though the argument may lack subtlety or counter-argument. | Using tricolon and anaphora without varying the techniques across the piece; Acknowledging a counter-argument only to dismiss it immediately rather than engaging with it seriously |
| **Secure** | Deploys a varied repertoire of rhetorical devices purposefully and effectively, integrating them into a coherent and well-structured argument that anticipates and addresses counter-arguments. | Deploying devices mechanically rather than allowing them to emerge from the argument's logic; Not varying the pacing -- alternating between longer analytical passages and shorter punchy ones creates more effective persuasion |
| **Mastery** | Uses rhetorical devices with precision and restraint, integrating them seamlessly into a sophisticated and multi-layered argument that anticipates the audience's resistance, makes strategic concessions, and builds towards a compelling conclusion. | Relying on a single rhetorical register throughout rather than modulating between concession, assertion, evidence and appeal; Making the argument one-sided -- the most persuasive writing acknowledges the strongest counter-argument and engages with it honestly |

### Secondary concept: Vocabulary Range and Precision (ENL-KS4-C014)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The ability to choose vocabulary that is precise, varied and appropriate to purpose and context, demonstrating a wide lexical range. Vocabulary choices should be evaluated in reading contexts and deployed deliberately in writing.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Uses a basic vocabulary that is adequate for communication but lacks precision, variety or awareness of register, with frequent repetition of common words. | Replacing common words with longer words that are not necessarily more precise ('utilise' instead of 'use' does not improve precision); Not considering whether the replacement word fits the register and tone of the writing |
| **Developing** | Selects vocabulary with increasing precision and awareness of connotation, uses some subject-specific terminology in analytical writing, and avoids obvious repetition. | Discussing vocabulary choices at the level of 'positive' and 'negative' connotations without specifying what associations the word activates; Using sophisticated vocabulary in analysis ('the writer juxtaposes') but not in creative writing, or vice versa |
| **Secure** | Deploys vocabulary with consistent precision in both analytical and creative writing, demonstrating awareness of denotation, connotation and register, and using lexical choices to create specific effects. | Achieving precise vocabulary in creative writing but reverting to generic analytical vocabulary ('effective', 'powerful', 'creates an atmosphere'); Using sophisticated vocabulary inconsistently -- a precise word choice followed by several vague ones undermines the overall effect |
| **Mastery** | Demonstrates exceptional lexical range and precision in all forms of writing, selecting vocabulary that operates on multiple levels simultaneously and creating effects that depend on the reader's sensitivity to nuance, connotation and semantic field. | Analysing vocabulary at a single level (denotation or connotation) without exploring how the same word operates across multiple registers; Selecting vocabulary for sophistication rather than precision -- the best word is not always the most complex one |

### Secondary concept: Punctuation and Spelling Accuracy (ENL-KS4-C015)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Accurate and deliberate use of the full range of punctuation marks and consistent, accurate spelling of a wide vocabulary. Punctuation should function both for grammatical accuracy and for stylistic effect — for example, using a colon to introduce an idea with drama, or a dash to signal a parenthetical aside.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Uses basic punctuation (full stops, capital letters, commas) mostly correctly but makes frequent errors with apostrophes, and avoids higher-level punctuation marks. Spelling of common words is generally accurate but errors increase with more ambitious vocabulary. | Confusing 'their', 'there' and 'they're', or 'its' and 'it's'; Using commas to join two complete sentences (comma splice) instead of a full stop, semi-colon or conjunction |
| **Developing** | Uses commas, apostrophes and speech marks correctly in most contexts, attempts higher-level punctuation (semi-colons, colons, dashes) with some accuracy, and spells most words correctly including commonly misspelled ones. | Using a semi-colon where a colon is needed, or vice versa; Misspelling words that are attempted precisely because they are ambitious -- e.g. 'definately', 'seperate', 'occassion' |
| **Secure** | Deploys the full range of punctuation marks accurately and for deliberate effect, and spells a wide vocabulary correctly and consistently, including subject-specific and literary terminology. | Using higher-level punctuation marks correctly but not exploiting their stylistic potential; Spelling ambitious vocabulary correctly in careful work but making errors under timed conditions |
| **Mastery** | Demonstrates flawless technical accuracy across extended writing under timed conditions, with punctuation functioning as a fully integrated element of style and meaning, and spelling that is consistently accurate even with the most ambitious vocabulary. | Maintaining accuracy in the opening paragraphs but allowing errors to creep in during the final third of timed writing; Deploying technically correct punctuation that nonetheless fails to enhance the writing's clarity or style |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Narrative and descriptive writing with craft requires pupils to make deliberate structural choices (narrative arc, descriptive sequence, sentence variety) that serve the function of sustaining the reader's interest and creating a specific imaginative effect.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- How do structural features at different scales interact to produce this function?
- What structural constraints limit what this system can do?
- Why have unrelated organisms evolved similar structures for similar functions?
- How would you apply structure-function analysis to improve this design?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Rhetorical devices, persuasive techniques and transactional writing forms are all tools for constructing arguments adapted to audience — the cognitive demand is selecting the most effective evidence and rhetorical strategies for the specific persuasive task.

---

## Session structure: Writer's Workshop

### Writer's Workshop
A process-writing sequence that develops pupils as independent writers. Studies a mentor text to identify craft techniques, practises those techniques in isolation, plans an original piece, drafts with attention to audience and purpose, engages in peer review for feedback, revises and edits, and publishes the final piece.

`mentor_text` → `technique_identification` → `planning` → `drafting` → `peer_review` → `editing` → `publication`

**Assessment:** Final published piece demonstrating identified craft techniques, with writing portfolio showing development through the drafting and revision process.

**Teacher note:** Use the WRITER'S WORKSHOP template: analyse a mentor text at a sophisticated level, examining the relationship between technique, purpose, and audience. Expect independent and purposeful drafting that demonstrates control of a range of techniques. Facilitate critical peer review and self-editing focused on precision, style, and the overall quality of written communication. Develop exam-standard writing that meets GCSE assessment objectives for accuracy, impact, and crafted expression.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does the mentor text balance technique with authenticity and voice?
- What range of techniques have you deployed, and how effectively do they serve your purpose?
- How would you evaluate the quality of your writing against GCSE assessment objectives?
- What final revisions would elevate your writing from competent to compelling?

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Non Fiction
**Features to teach:** headline and subheadings for articles, formal letter conventions (address, salutation, sign-off), topic sentences and paragraph organisation, register matching to publication or recipient, evidence and examples to support arguments

**Writing outcome:** Write either a newspaper article (450-600 words) with headline, subheadings, and journalistic register, or a formal letter (450-600 words) with appropriate conventions, in response to a specified viewpoint

**Literary terms:** register, tone, headline, subheading, topic sentence, formal register

---

## Genre

- **Transactional:** Purpose-driven non-fiction forms written for a specific audience and context. The KS3-KS4 progression from KS2 persuasion and discussion: at GCSE, transactional writing encompasses all non-fiction forms (letter, article, speech, review, report) and is assessed on audience awareness, register control, and rhetorical effectiveness. The most frequently examined writing form on GCSE Language Paper 2.

---

## Why this study matters

Articles and formal letters are the two other transactional forms most commonly examined on Paper 2. Teaching them together allows students to compare how audience and form shape register and structural choices. The article demands a journalistic voice with punchy sentences; the letter demands formal conventions and measured argument. Students who can write confidently in both forms are prepared for any Paper 2 question.

---

## Sequencing

**Follows:** Transactional Writing: Speech

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Article lacks a clear headline and uses personal essay register rather than journalistic style
2. Letter opens with 'I am writing to you...' rather than establishing the issue immediately
3. Both forms written identically without adjusting register for the different audiences
4. Paragraph structure breaks down in the middle of the piece
