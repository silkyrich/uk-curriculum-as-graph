## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **3 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Victorian Narrative Fiction — Genre and Form (ELT-KS4-C004)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

The conventions of 19th-century prose fiction genres including the realist novel, the Gothic novel, the sensation novel, the bildungsroman and the novella. Students must understand how genre conventions shape readers' expectations and how specific writers work within, extend or subvert those conventions.

**Teaching guidance:** Understanding genre convention allows students to make sophisticated AO2 and AO3 points. Realist fiction creates verisimilitude through detailed social observation, psychological characterisation and plausible causal narrative — students can then analyse when a specific moment departs from realism and why. Gothic fiction employs darkness, the uncanny, physical setting as psychological externalisation, doubles and transgression — understanding this allows analysis of specific Gothic effects. The bildungsroman tracks a protagonist's moral and social development — students should trace the arc of change across the whole text. The novella form (A Christmas Carol, Jekyll and Hyde) makes structural analysis possible even in examination: its compactness means that opening and ending can be compared in a single response.

**Key vocabulary:** realism, Gothic, bildungsroman, novella, sensation fiction, social realism, melodrama, narrative voice, first-person narrator, third-person omniscient, free indirect discourse, verisimilitude, characterisation, setting, atmosphere

**Common misconceptions:** Students often describe narrative events without analysing the narrative technique through which they are presented. Students may not distinguish between the author, the narrator and the character, leading to confused analysis. Some students treat Gothic elements as simply 'spooky' without understanding their function within the ideological concerns of the period.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify basic genre features of the studied 19th-century text (e.g. 'it is a Gothic novel' or 'it is about poverty') but does not explain how genre conventions shape the reader's experience. | What genre is 'A Christmas Carol' by Dickens? How can you tell? | Naming the genre without explaining how its conventions shape the writing; Treating genre as a label rather than a set of conventions that create specific reader expectations |
| **Developing** | Identifies genre conventions in the studied text and explains how they shape characterisation, setting or narrative structure, making some connections between form and meaning. | How does Stevenson use the conventions of Gothic fiction in 'The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde'? Give two examples. | Identifying Gothic features (dark settings, supernatural elements) without explaining how they function within the specific concerns of this text; Listing conventions without connecting them to the text's thematic or ideological purpose |
| **Secure** | Analyses how the 19th-century writer works within, extends or subverts genre conventions, connecting formal choices to the social and ideological concerns of the period and demonstrating understanding of narrative technique. | Analyse how Dickens uses the conventions of the novella form and the ghost story genre in 'A Christmas Carol' to create a text that is both entertaining and politically purposeful. | Analysing genre conventions without connecting them to the text's political or social purpose; Treating narrative technique as decoration rather than as a tool that serves the writer's ideological aims |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates how 19th-century genre conventions encode the ideological assumptions of the period, analyses how the writer both employs and interrogates those conventions, and considers how modern readers may respond differently to the text than its original audience. | Evaluate how the genre conventions of 'The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde' encode specifically Victorian anxieties. Consider how a modern reader might interpret these conventions differently from a Victorian audience. | Analysing Victorian genre conventions without acknowledging that they encode ideological assumptions the writer may not have been fully conscious of; Comparing Victorian and modern readings without being precise about what has changed and why |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *It is a ghost story because there are ghosts in it. It is also a morality tale because Scrooge learns to be a better person. The supernatural elements and the moral lesson tell us what genre it is.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Stevenson uses Gothic conventions to create an atmosphere of concealment and dread. First, the setting of London is presented as a labyrinth of dark streets and hidden doors -- the description of Hyde's entrance as 'the door, which was equipped with neither bell nor knocker, was blistered and distained' uses adjectives that suggest neglect and decay, typical of Gothic architecture. The hidden door literally leads to Jekyll's respectable house, making the building itself a physical metaphor for the duality theme. Second, Stevenson uses the convention of the fragmented narrative -- the story is told through multiple accounts, letters and third-person observation rather than a single authoritative narrator. This fragmentation is a Gothic convention that creates uncertainty: the reader, like the characters, must piece together the truth from incomplete evidence, which mirrors the epistemological anxiety of a society that fears what lies beneath respectable surfaces.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Dickens exploits the compactness of the novella form and the supernatural machinery of the ghost story to deliver a polemic against Victorian economic individualism disguised as a Christmas entertainment. The novella's brevity is essential to the text's rhetorical strategy: Scrooge's transformation from miser to philanthropist takes place in a single night, compressing what would be a gradual psychological change into an urgent, theatrical one. This formal compression serves Dickens's purpose: he is not interested in realistic character development but in demonstrating that moral transformation is possible immediately -- a direct challenge to Malthusian economics, which argued that poverty was a natural and irremediable condition. The ghost story genre provides the mechanism for this compression. Each spirit operates as a different mode of persuasion: the Ghost of Christmas Past uses memory and empathy (pathos), the Ghost of Christmas Present uses evidence of suffering (logos -- Dickens shows Scrooge the Cratchit family as a living counter-argument to his philosophy), and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come uses fear (a silent, hooded figure whose method is pure Gothic terror). The genre convention of the supernatural visitation allows Dickens to bypass the realist novel's requirement for plausibility -- no one asks how ghosts can transport a man through time, because the genre has already established the contract. The result is a text that is simultaneously a ghost story (entertainment), a novella (literary form), a sermon (moral argument) and a political pamphlet (critique of the New Poor Law). Dickens's genius is in recognising that the Christmas genre -- festive, communal, emotionally generous -- is the perfect vehicle for an argument about social responsibility, because it allows him to present redistribution of wealth not as radical politics but as seasonal goodwill.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Stevenson's novella works simultaneously as Gothic horror, detective fiction and psychological case study, and each generic layer encodes a distinct Victorian anxiety. The Gothic layer -- Hyde's deformity, his association with darkness and back streets, the locked laboratory -- externalises the fear of degeneration: the scientific theory, prevalent in the 1880s, that civilisation could regress, that the veneer of respectability concealed an atavistic violence that might erupt at any moment. Hyde is consistently described in terms that invoke evolutionary regression -- 'hardly human', 'ape-like fury', 'troglodytic' -- which places the novella within a post-Darwinian anxiety about what humanity might revert to when moral restraints are removed. The detective fiction layer -- Utterson's investigation, the fragmented narrative, the locked-room mystery -- encodes epistemological anxiety: the fear that the truth is not merely hidden but structurally unknowable. Victorian society was organised around public performance of respectability, and Stevenson's fragmented form mirrors a social order in which no single perspective has access to the whole truth. The revelation that Jekyll and Hyde are the same person is not just a plot twist but a structural argument: identity itself is multiple, and the detective's search for a single explanation is destined to fail. A modern reader encounters these conventions differently. The duality of Jekyll and Hyde, which for Victorian readers dramatised the repression required by respectability, is now more commonly read through a psychological lens: the text becomes an allegory of addiction, mental illness, or the fragmentation of modern identity. The Gothic deformity of Hyde, which Stevenson's original readers might have read as moral physiognomy (evil visible in the body), is now more likely to prompt discomfort about the text's equation of physical difference with moral corruption -- a reading that reveals the ableist and potentially racist assumptions embedded in Victorian Gothic convention. The genre conventions that made the text legible in 1886 have not changed, but the ideological frameworks through which we interpret them have, which is precisely why 19th-century texts remain valuable objects of study: they reveal not only the anxieties of their own period but the assumptions of ours.*

### Secondary concept: Victorian Social and Historical Context (ELT-KS4-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

The social, economic and historical conditions of the Victorian era that shape 19th-century literary texts: industrialisation, poverty, class stratification, the role of women, the British Empire, religious doubt, the rise of science, the workhouse, child labour, philanthropy and social reform movements.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows basic facts about the Victorian period (e.g. 'there was a lot of poverty', 'women had fewer rights') but includes them as general background rather than connecting them to specific textual moments. | Making general statements about the Victorian period without connecting them to specific moments in the text; Presenting context as 'in those days...' without explaining how that historical reality shapes a specific character, scene or language choice |
| **Developing** | Connects specific Victorian social or historical conditions to specific moments in the text, explaining how context illuminates the writer's choices, though connections may be limited to the most obvious examples. | Explaining Victorian class structure accurately but not connecting it to a specific quotation or moment in the text; Treating the writer's attitude as identical to the characters' attitudes -- Dickens criticises what Pip admires |
| **Secure** | Integrates Victorian social and historical context fluently into literary analysis, using context to explain why specific language, character and structural choices resonate within their historical moment, and distinguishing between the author's perspective and the characters' perspectives. | Describing the setting without connecting it to the social anxieties of the period; Using context to explain what the writer describes rather than why the writer describes it in this specific way |
| **Mastery** | Uses Victorian contextual knowledge with critical sophistication, recognising that 19th-century writers are both products of and commentators on their culture, and evaluating how the text both reflects and challenges the ideological assumptions of its period. | Praising the writer's social critique without evaluating whether the text's resolution actually challenges or reinforces the structures it criticises; Treating the Victorian period as monolithic rather than recognising that writers like Dickens were in dialogue with specific political and economic debates of their moment |

### Secondary concept: Characterisation and Narrative Voice (ELT-KS4-C006)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

How writers construct character through multiple techniques: physical description, dialogue, action, the responses of other characters, narrative commentary, and the reliability or unreliability of the narrative voice. Students must distinguish between the author's implied values and those of the characters and narrator.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can describe what characters do and say but treats them as real people rather than analysing how the writer constructs them through specific techniques. | Describing the character's qualities without explaining how the writer creates those impressions; Writing about characters as though they are real people making choices rather than constructions made by the author |
| **Developing** | Analyses how the writer presents character through specific techniques (description, dialogue, action, others' reactions) and begins to distinguish between what a character says and what the writer implies. | Analysing one method of characterisation (e.g. description) without considering how multiple methods work together; Identifying that other characters react to Scrooge but not explaining how these reactions shape the reader's understanding |
| **Secure** | Analyses characterisation as a deliberate authorial strategy, examining how the writer controls sympathy, uses narrative voice to position the reader, and develops character across the whole text to serve thematic purposes. | Analysing characterisation without considering the role of narrative voice in shaping the reader's response; Tracing character development without connecting it to the text's thematic concerns |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates characterisation as an ideological strategy, analysing how the writer's construction of character encodes specific values and assumptions, how narrative voice positions the reader to accept or challenge those values, and how different critical perspectives produce different readings of the same character. | Offering a single interpretation of the characterisation without recognising that the text's deliberate ambiguity invites multiple readings; Analysing characterisation only through what characters do and say, without considering what the text withholds and why |

### Secondary concept: Whole-Text Knowledge and Quotation Retention (ELT-KS4-C014)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The ability to demonstrate detailed knowledge of a complete literary text — novel, play or poetry selection — including the ability to recall and deploy relevant quotations accurately in a closed-book examination. Whole-text knowledge supports the ability to trace development of character, theme and technique across a complete work.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows the plot of the studied text and can recall a few key quotations, but quotations tend to be from the opening or the most famous scenes, and the student struggles to connect quotations to analytical points. | Using a quotation that is famous but not well-suited to the specific point being made; Including a quotation but not analysing its language -- the quotation sits in the response without doing analytical work |
| **Developing** | Can recall quotations from across the text (not just the opening or the most famous scenes) and uses them to support analytical points, though quotations may be long and imprecisely selected. | Selecting quotations that are longer than necessary -- a shorter, more precise quotation usually generates better analysis; Recalling quotations accurately from the early acts but becoming less precise for later parts of the text |
| **Secure** | Deploys memorised quotations precisely and strategically across the whole text, selecting short, analytically rich quotations that generate multiple points of analysis, and connecting specific textual moments to whole-text arguments. | Deploying quotations to illustrate the theme without using them to build a developing argument across the essay; Drawing on quotations from only two or three scenes rather than demonstrating knowledge of the whole text |
| **Mastery** | Demonstrates comprehensive and precise knowledge of the complete text, deploying quotations with strategic selectivity to build a complex and sustained argument, and using textual knowledge to connect specific moments to whole-text patterns, contextual significance and critical debates. | Demonstrating extensive quotation recall but not using it strategically -- quantity of quotation is less important than precision and analytical yield; Drawing on well-known quotations without demonstrating knowledge of less frequently discussed scenes that would strengthen the argument |

## Thinking lens: Perspective and Interpretation (primary)

**Key question:** Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?

**Why this lens fits:** Victorian social and historical context is the perspectival framework within which 19th-century texts must be read — understanding the values and assumptions of the period allows pupils to interpret why characters, narrators and authors take the positions they do.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- How do power structures determine whose perspective dominates this narrative?
- What are the epistemological limits of interpreting this source?
- How would you position your interpretation within the existing historiographical debate?
- Can two contradictory interpretations both be valid? Under what conditions?

**Secondary lens:** Continuity and Change Over Time — Victorian genre and social context situate the text within a specific historical moment — pupils must understand what was distinctive about that moment (industrialisation, class, gender) and how those conditions shaped the literary forms that emerged.

---

## Session structure: Text Study (Literature)

### Text Study (Literature)
A KS4 literature study sequence designed for GCSE English Literature preparation. Contextualises the text within its literary and historical period, develops close reading skills, applies literary analysis using subject terminology, supports comparison across texts, and scaffolds essay writing in exam-appropriate formats.

`context_setting` → `close_reading` → `literary_analysis` → `comparison` → `essay_writing`

**Assessment:** Timed essay response in GCSE format demonstrating close textual analysis, use of literary terminology, contextual understanding, and structured argument with embedded quotations.

**Teacher note:** Use the LITERATURE TEXT STUDY template: establish the historical, social, and literary context of the text. Guide close reading with attention to language, form, structure, and the effects on the reader. Expect analysis using precise literary terminology and comparison with other texts where appropriate. Develop essay writing skills including thesis construction, embedded quotation, and sustained analytical argument in line with GCSE assessment objectives.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does the writer use language, form, and structure to create meaning?
- What is the significance of this passage in the context of the whole text?
- How does the social or historical context shape our understanding of this text?
- How would you construct an essay that analyses this text with reference to the assessment objectives?

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Fiction
**Features to teach:** gothic conventions (secrecy, darkness, double, transgression), narrative structure and perspective (Utterson as narrator, delayed revelation), symbolism (the door, the laboratory, the mirror), Victorian duality (public respectability versus private desire)

**Writing outcome:** Write an analytical essay (600-800 words) exploring how Stevenson presents the theme of duality in Jekyll and Hyde, analysing how gothic conventions and narrative structure create meaning

**Literary terms:** gothic, duality, allegory, symbolism, unreliable narrator, foreshadowing, epistolary, novella

---

## Genre

- **Literary Fiction:** Prose fiction studied analytically for its literary qualities rather than simply read for plot. The progression from KS2 narrative: at KS3-KS4, fiction becomes an object of critical study where students analyse how authors construct meaning through language, structure, and form. Includes both reading (textual analysis) and writing (creative composition).

---

## Set texts

- **Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde** by Robert Louis Stevenson

---

## Why this study matters

Jekyll and Hyde is a strong alternative to A Christmas Carol as the 19th-century novel choice. Its gothic genre and themes of duality appeal to students who find Dickens' moral earnestness less engaging. The novella's complex narrative structure (Utterson's limited perspective, the final chapter reveal) teaches analytical skills about how form shapes meaning. Victorian repression and the public/private divide connect to modern debates about identity and social media personas.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Treating the story as a horror story rather than analysing its allegorical and thematic depth
2. Ignoring the narrative structure (students assume it is told in chronological order from Jekyll's perspective)
3. Victorian context about repression and respectability presented without linking to Stevenson's specific textual choices
