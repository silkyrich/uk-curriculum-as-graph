## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **3 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Modern Drama — Theatrical Technique and Stagecraft (ELT-KS4-C007)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

How modern playwrights use dramatic technique — stage directions, dialogue, dramatic irony, monologue, staging, symbol and set — to create meaning and effect. Students must understand the relationship between written dramatic text and theatrical performance, and how different production choices affect interpretation.

**Teaching guidance:** AO2 responses to modern drama must engage with theatrical as well as literary techniques. Teach students to treat stage directions as significant meaning-making choices: an expressionist set design signals something about the playwright's intentions that differs from a naturalist one. Dramatic irony in modern drama often operates as social or political critique — the audience knows something the character refuses to acknowledge. Teach students how Miller, Priestly and Russell use the form of well-made play, drawing room drama or musical theatre to create specific expectations and then subvert them. Questions about drama should always consider the effect on an audience, not just a reader.

**Key vocabulary:** stage directions, stagecraft, dramatic irony, soliloquy, monologue, aside, naturalism, expressionism, set design, symbolism, tragic hero, social realism, political theatre, theatre of the absurd, tension, climax, denouement

**Common misconceptions:** Students often analyse modern drama as if it were prose fiction, ignoring theatrical conventions and the relationship between text and performance. Students may treat stage directions as stage management instructions rather than as deliberate authorial choices that carry meaning. Some students fail to consider the effect of theatrical decisions on an audience, writing only about the reader.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify basic dramatic elements in a modern play (e.g. stage directions, dialogue) but analyses the text as though it were prose rather than a script intended for performance. | Read this extract from 'An Inspector Calls'. What do the stage directions tell us about the character of Mr Birling? | Treating stage directions as factual description rather than as the playwright's instructions to actors and set designers; Analysing dialogue without considering how it would be delivered on stage |
| **Developing** | Analyses how the playwright uses specific dramatic techniques (stage directions, dramatic irony, entrances and exits, the relationship between dialogue and action) to create meaning for an audience. | Analyse how Priestley uses dramatic irony in Act 1 of 'An Inspector Calls'. Give two examples and explain their effect on the audience. | Identifying dramatic irony without explaining how it shapes the audience's relationship with the characters; Describing the effect of stage directions without considering how different directorial choices might realise them |
| **Secure** | Analyses modern drama as a theatrical text, integrating understanding of stagecraft, dramatic structure, the playwright's use of space and time, and the relationship between text and performance to produce a sustained and coherent interpretation. | Analyse how Priestley uses the structure of 'An Inspector Calls' to develop his argument about collective responsibility. Consider the play as a whole. | Analysing the play's themes without connecting them to its structural and dramatic choices; Treating the Inspector as a realistic character rather than analysing his function as a dramatic and rhetorical device |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates modern drama with critical sophistication, considering how the playwright's theatrical choices encode political and philosophical arguments, how different production choices affect interpretation, and how the text operates differently on stage and on the page. | Evaluate how effectively Priestley uses the form of the well-made play in 'An Inspector Calls' to deliver a political argument. Consider whether the theatrical form supports or limits the political message. | Evaluating the political argument without evaluating whether the theatrical form supports or constrains it; Discussing the play only as a text without considering how production choices can extend, limit or transform its meaning |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *The stage directions say that Mr Birling is 'heavy-looking, rather portentous'. This tells us he is big and important-looking. He is probably quite rich because the stage directions describe the dining room as having 'good solid furniture'.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Priestley uses dramatic irony extensively in Act 1 to undermine Birling's authority before the Inspector even arrives. When Birling announces that 'the Germans don't want war' and that the Titanic is 'unsinkable -- absolutely unsinkable', the 1945 audience knows both predictions are catastrophically wrong: the First World War killed millions and the Titanic sank on its maiden voyage. This dramatic irony is devastating because it destroys Birling's credibility at the very moment he is asserting it. By the time the Inspector arrives, the audience already distrusts Birling's judgement -- so when he dismisses responsibility for Eva Smith, the audience is primed to side with the Inspector. Priestley also uses the timing of the Inspector's entrance as dramatic irony: he arrives immediately after Birling's speech about 'a man has to mind his own business', interrupting the philosophy of individualism with a literal embodiment of collective responsibility. The doorbell becomes a dramatic punctuation mark that answers Birling's speech before a word of rebuttal is spoken.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Priestley structures 'An Inspector Calls' as a systematic demolition of bourgeois self-image, and the three-act structure serves this purpose with architectural precision. Act 1 establishes the family's self-congratulatory unity -- the engagement celebration, the comfortable dining room, Birling's expansive speeches -- and then introduces the Inspector, whose method is to address each family member in turn. This sequential interrogation is structurally important: each revelation makes the next harder to deny, because the cumulative effect of multiple connections to Eva Smith transforms coincidence into complicity. Priestley uses the well-made play structure (exposition, complication, crisis, resolution) but subverts its conventional resolution. In a traditional well-made play, the final act restores order: the guilty are punished, the innocent vindicated, the audience reassured. Priestley denies this resolution twice. First, the family discovers that there may be no Inspector and no death -- and the older generation (Birling, Mrs Birling) immediately revert to their original positions, treating the evening as 'nothing but a lot of moonshine'. This false resolution exposes the shallowness of their moral awakening: they are relieved, not reformed. The second subversion -- the telephone call announcing that a real inspector is on the way -- destroys the false resolution and reinstates the play's moral argument with even greater force. The circular structure (ending where it began) is a theatrical device that functions as a trap: the audience watches the Birlings repeat their failure, and the repetition implies that without genuine change, society will continue to produce Eva Smiths. Sheila's refusal to accept the false resolution -- 'You're pretending everything is just as it was' -- positions her as the play's moral centre, but Priestley makes clear that individual enlightenment is insufficient without collective transformation.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Priestley's choice of the well-made play form is both strategically brilliant and ideologically limited, and evaluating this tension is essential to understanding the play's lasting impact and its contradictions. The well-made play -- parlour setting, limited cast, unities of time and place, detective-plot structure -- is a bourgeois form: it was developed to entertain the very class Priestley critiques. By using this form to deliver a socialist argument, Priestley performs a kind of rhetorical Trojan horse: the audience expects entertainment and receives an indictment. The form's reliance on revelation and surprise -- each character's connection to Eva is uncovered in turn -- creates a propulsive momentum that makes the political argument feel like a thriller. The audience wants to know what happens next, and Priestley exploits this narrative desire to force them through a political education they did not sign up for. However, the form also contains the argument in ways that may limit it. The well-made play resolves in a single evening, in a single room, with a single family -- and this containment risks reducing systemic injustice to individual guilt. Eva Smith's death is presented as the consequence of specific decisions by specific people, which is dramatically satisfying but sociologically simplistic: exploitation is structural, not accidental, and the implication that it can be prevented by individual moral improvement is precisely the liberal position that Priestley's socialism should challenge. The 1992 Stephen Daldry production addressed this limitation by literalising what the text only implies: the house was placed on stilts above a crowd of working-class figures, and at the Inspector's exit, the house collapsed onto the stage, physically destroying the bourgeois space and suggesting that the Birlings' world is structurally unsustainable, not merely morally compromised. This production choice reveals what the text constrains: the political argument is present but can only fully emerge when the theatrical form is disrupted. The telephone call at the end -- the circular return -- is the text's most sophisticated formal device because it refuses both resolution and resignation. The play does not end in reform or in despair; it ends in repetition, which is Priestley's bleakest and most honest statement: history will repeat itself unless something changes, and the play itself is the argument for change.*

### Secondary concept: Characterisation and Narrative Voice (ELT-KS4-C006)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

How writers construct character through multiple techniques: physical description, dialogue, action, the responses of other characters, narrative commentary, and the reliability or unreliability of the narrative voice. Students must distinguish between the author's implied values and those of the characters and narrator.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can describe what characters do and say but treats them as real people rather than analysing how the writer constructs them through specific techniques. | Describing the character's qualities without explaining how the writer creates those impressions; Writing about characters as though they are real people making choices rather than constructions made by the author |
| **Developing** | Analyses how the writer presents character through specific techniques (description, dialogue, action, others' reactions) and begins to distinguish between what a character says and what the writer implies. | Analysing one method of characterisation (e.g. description) without considering how multiple methods work together; Identifying that other characters react to Scrooge but not explaining how these reactions shape the reader's understanding |
| **Secure** | Analyses characterisation as a deliberate authorial strategy, examining how the writer controls sympathy, uses narrative voice to position the reader, and develops character across the whole text to serve thematic purposes. | Analysing characterisation without considering the role of narrative voice in shaping the reader's response; Tracing character development without connecting it to the text's thematic concerns |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates characterisation as an ideological strategy, analysing how the writer's construction of character encodes specific values and assumptions, how narrative voice positions the reader to accept or challenge those values, and how different critical perspectives produce different readings of the same character. | Offering a single interpretation of the characterisation without recognising that the text's deliberate ambiguity invites multiple readings; Analysing characterisation only through what characters do and say, without considering what the text withholds and why |

### Secondary concept: Whole-Text Knowledge and Quotation Retention (ELT-KS4-C014)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The ability to demonstrate detailed knowledge of a complete literary text — novel, play or poetry selection — including the ability to recall and deploy relevant quotations accurately in a closed-book examination. Whole-text knowledge supports the ability to trace development of character, theme and technique across a complete work.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows the plot of the studied text and can recall a few key quotations, but quotations tend to be from the opening or the most famous scenes, and the student struggles to connect quotations to analytical points. | Using a quotation that is famous but not well-suited to the specific point being made; Including a quotation but not analysing its language -- the quotation sits in the response without doing analytical work |
| **Developing** | Can recall quotations from across the text (not just the opening or the most famous scenes) and uses them to support analytical points, though quotations may be long and imprecisely selected. | Selecting quotations that are longer than necessary -- a shorter, more precise quotation usually generates better analysis; Recalling quotations accurately from the early acts but becoming less precise for later parts of the text |
| **Secure** | Deploys memorised quotations precisely and strategically across the whole text, selecting short, analytically rich quotations that generate multiple points of analysis, and connecting specific textual moments to whole-text arguments. | Deploying quotations to illustrate the theme without using them to build a developing argument across the essay; Drawing on quotations from only two or three scenes rather than demonstrating knowledge of the whole text |
| **Mastery** | Demonstrates comprehensive and precise knowledge of the complete text, deploying quotations with strategic selectivity to build a complex and sustained argument, and using textual knowledge to connect specific moments to whole-text patterns, contextual significance and critical debates. | Demonstrating extensive quotation recall but not using it strategically -- quantity of quotation is less important than precision and analytical yield; Drawing on well-known quotations without demonstrating knowledge of less frequently discussed scenes that would strengthen the argument |

### Secondary concept: Literary Critical Writing Style (ELT-KS4-C015)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The ability to write in a sustained, formal analytical style appropriate to literary criticism: using a critical vocabulary, sustaining a coherent argument across an extended piece of writing, embedding quotations fluently, avoiding retelling plot, and developing an informed and individual perspective on a text.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Writes about literature in a predominantly narrative mode ('Then Macbeth kills Duncan...'), uses informal register, and does not embed quotations or sustain an analytical argument. | Retelling what happens rather than analysing how the writer creates effects; Using quotations as illustration rather than as the starting point for analysis |
| **Developing** | Writes in a recognisably analytical mode, uses some critical vocabulary, embeds quotations within sentences, and sustains a point across a paragraph, though the argument may not develop beyond a single idea. | Sustaining a point within a paragraph but not developing it across multiple paragraphs into a full argument; Embedding quotations grammatically but not analysing the specific language within the quotation |
| **Secure** | Writes sustained literary essays in a formal critical style, developing a coherent argument across multiple paragraphs, embedding quotations fluently, using precise critical vocabulary, and maintaining a personal interpretive voice. | Writing competent analytical paragraphs that do not connect into a developing argument -- each paragraph should advance the essay's position, not just illustrate it; Using critical vocabulary ('Shakespeare suggests', 'the imagery conveys') without precision -- what specifically does the imagery convey? |
| **Mastery** | Writes literary essays of exceptional quality: a distinctive critical voice, a sustained and sophisticated argument, precise quotation deployment, confident engagement with alternative interpretations, and a prose style that is itself a demonstration of the analytical and stylistic skills the essay discusses. | Writing a technically accomplished essay that lacks a distinctive critical voice -- the best essays sound like a specific, thinking person, not a template; Producing a sustained argument that does not engage with the strongest counter-argument -- critical confidence requires the willingness to address the best objection to your position |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Modern drama theatrical technique/stagecraft and modern fiction narrative technique are structure-function analytical skills — pupils explain how directors' and authors' formal choices (lighting, staging, narrative perspective, time structure) create specific effects on audience and reader.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- How do structural features at different scales interact to produce this function?
- What structural constraints limit what this system can do?
- Why have unrelated organisms evolved similar structures for similar functions?
- How would you apply structure-function analysis to improve this design?

**Secondary lens:** Perspective and Interpretation — Analysing narrative technique (point of view, unreliable narrator, free indirect discourse) requires pupils to ask whose perspective is being constructed and how the author manipulates reader access to characters' inner lives.

## Session structure: Text Study (Literature)

### Text Study (Literature)
A KS4 literature study sequence designed for GCSE English Literature preparation. Contextualises the text within its literary and historical period, develops close reading skills, applies literary analysis using subject terminology, supports comparison across texts, and scaffolds essay writing in exam-appropriate formats.

`context_setting` → `close_reading` → `literary_analysis` → `comparison` → `essay_writing`

**Assessment:** Timed essay response in GCSE format demonstrating close textual analysis, use of literary terminology, contextual understanding, and structured argument with embedded quotations.

**Teacher note:** Use the LITERATURE TEXT STUDY template: establish the historical, social, and literary context of the text. Guide close reading with attention to language, form, structure, and the effects on the reader. Expect analysis using precise literary terminology and comparison with other texts where appropriate. Develop essay writing skills including thesis construction, embedded quotation, and sustained analytical argument in line with GCSE assessment objectives.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does the writer use language, form, and structure to create meaning?
- What is the significance of this passage in the context of the whole text?
- How does the social or historical context shape our understanding of this text?
- How would you construct an essay that analyses this text with reference to the assessment objectives?

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Drama
**Features to teach:** three unities (time, place, action) for dramatic tension, Inspector as dramatic device (morality play conventions), generational divide (Birling parents versus Sheila and Eric), dramatic irony (1912 setting, 1945 audience, 21st-century reader)

**Writing outcome:** Write an analytical essay (600-800 words) exploring how Priestley presents ideas about responsibility in An Inspector Calls, using quotations and contextual knowledge of 1912 and 1945

**Literary terms:** dramatic irony, morality play, three unities, symbolism, cliff-hanger, stage directions, didactic

---

## Genre

- **Drama:** Dramatic literature studied for its theatrical and literary qualities. Distinct from KS1-KS2 playscript writing: at KS3-KS4, drama means studying published plays as literary texts, analysing dramatic conventions, and understanding performance context. Shakespeare study is the dominant form at KS4.

---

## Set texts

- **An Inspector Calls** by J.B. Priestley

---

## Why this study matters

An Inspector Calls is the dominant modern text on AQA (75-80% of entries). Its tight structure (one room, one evening) makes it manageable for close study. Priestley's didactic purpose and the 1912/1945 dual timeline provide excellent AO3 opportunities. The generational divide resonates with teenage students, and the play's socialist message provokes genuine debate about responsibility.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Treating the play as a whodunit rather than a moral argument
2. Context about 1912 and 1945 presented as background information rather than integrated into analysis of Priestley's choices
3. The Inspector treated as a realistic character rather than analysed as a dramatic device
