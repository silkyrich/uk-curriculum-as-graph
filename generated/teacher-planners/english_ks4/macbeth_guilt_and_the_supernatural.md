## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **3 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Shakespearean Dramatic Conventions (ELT-KS4-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

The theatrical conventions of Elizabethan and Jacobean drama that Shakespeare employs: blank verse (unrhymed iambic pentameter) versus prose, soliloquy, the aside, dramatic irony, the five-act structure, the role of the chorus, disguise and mistaken identity. Students must understand how these conventions create specific theatrical effects.

**Teaching guidance:** AO2 responses to Shakespeare must engage with form as well as language. Teach students to identify when Shakespeare shifts between verse and prose (prose typically signals lower-class characters, heightened emotion, or madness) and why. Soliloquy analysis should consider what it reveals (inner life, true motive) versus what is concealed from other characters (dramatic irony). The five-act structure provides a framework for understanding dramatic pace — Acts 3 and 4 typically contain the crisis and turning point. Students should be able to explain how a specific formal or structural choice creates a specific effect on the audience. Examination command words: 'explore', 'analyse', 'how does Shakespeare present'.

**Key vocabulary:** blank verse, iambic pentameter, prose, soliloquy, aside, dramatic irony, five-act structure, prologue, chorus, tragedy, comedy, history, protagonist, antagonist, tragic flaw, hubris, catharsis, stagecraft

**Common misconceptions:** Students often describe what a character does or says without analysing how Shakespeare constructs that character through specific language and dramatic choices. Students frequently write about Shakespeare's characters as real people rather than dramatic constructions. Many students ignore the theatrical context, writing literary analyses that do not consider the effect on an audience in a theatre.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify basic dramatic features in Shakespeare (e.g. recognises a soliloquy or aside) but does not explain how these conventions create specific theatrical effects. | Read this extract from Act 1, Scene 7 of 'Macbeth'. What dramatic convention is Shakespeare using when Macbeth speaks alone on stage? Why might Shakespeare have chosen this moment for a soliloquy? | Defining the convention ('a soliloquy is when a character speaks alone') without analysing its dramatic function in this specific moment; Treating the soliloquy as simply 'the character's thoughts' rather than a deliberate dramatic device that creates tension between public and private selves |
| **Developing** | Explains the function of key dramatic conventions (soliloquy, aside, verse/prose shifts, dramatic irony) with reference to specific moments, and begins to consider the effect on an audience rather than just a reader. | In 'Macbeth', Shakespeare shifts between verse and prose. Find one example of each in the extract and explain why Shakespeare makes this shift. | Identifying the verse/prose distinction without explaining why Shakespeare shifts between them at specific moments; Discussing Shakespeare's language as though it is being read silently rather than performed to a live audience |
| **Secure** | Analyses how Shakespeare uses dramatic conventions as interconnected tools to create meaning, control audience response and develop character, integrating analysis of convention with close reading of language. | Read Act 3, Scene 4 of 'Macbeth' (the banquet scene). Analyse how Shakespeare uses dramatic conventions to present Macbeth's deteriorating mental state. | Analysing dramatic conventions in isolation rather than showing how multiple conventions interact in a single scene; Describing the effect on 'the reader' rather than 'the audience', missing the theatrical dimension of the text |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates Shakespeare's use of dramatic conventions with critical sophistication, considering how different theatrical interpretations affect meaning, and connecting formal choices to the broader thematic and political concerns of the play. | Evaluate how Shakespeare uses the conventions of tragedy in 'Macbeth'. Consider whether Macbeth fits the classical model of the tragic hero and how Shakespeare adapts or subverts tragic convention. | Applying the classical tragic framework mechanically without evaluating whether Shakespeare adapts or subverts it; Treating Shakespeare's dramatic conventions as static features rather than as dynamic tools that evolve across the play |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *This is a soliloquy because Macbeth is speaking alone. Shakespeare uses it so the audience can hear what Macbeth is thinking. He is thinking about whether to kill Duncan.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Macbeth speaks in blank verse when addressing the court: 'If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well / It were done quickly.' The iambic pentameter creates a rhythmic, elevated register appropriate to his status as a nobleman and warrior. However, the Porter in Act 2 Scene 3 speaks in prose: 'Here's a knocking indeed!' This shift signals a change in social class -- the Porter is a commoner -- and also a change in dramatic mode from the tense, poetic atmosphere of the murder scene to vulgar comic relief. The prose allows the actor to improvise and the audience to breathe after the intensity of Duncan's killing.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Shakespeare uses the banquet scene to externalise Macbeth's psychological collapse through three converging dramatic conventions. First, dramatic irony: the audience knows Banquo has been murdered on Macbeth's orders, so when Macbeth says 'I drink to the general joy o' the whole table, and to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss', the irony is excruciating -- the audience watches Macbeth perform hospitality while the ghost of his crime literally sits at the table. Second, the ghost itself functions as a theatrical convention that makes internal guilt visible: whether the audience sees the ghost (as in many productions) or sees only an empty chair (as the stage direction is ambiguous), the effect is a splitting of reality -- what Macbeth sees and what his guests see are different, dramatising his isolation from the world of the sane. Third, the disruption of verse signals the disruption of order: Macbeth's lines become increasingly fragmented -- 'Avaunt, and quit my sight! Let the earth hide thee!' -- the exclamatory syntax and caesurae breaking the iambic line, formally enacting the loss of composure that the action dramatises. Lady Macbeth's asides to the lords -- 'Sit, worthy friends. My lord is often thus' -- create a secondary dramatic register, a performance-within-a-performance, as she attempts to manage public perception while privately recognising that her husband is losing control. The banquet scene thus uses Shakespeare's full repertoire of dramatic convention to stage the moment when Macbeth's public and private selves can no longer be held apart.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Shakespeare both employs and complicates the classical tragic model in 'Macbeth', creating a protagonist who resists comfortable categorisation. The Aristotelian framework -- hamartia, peripeteia, anagnorisis, catharsis -- is present but deliberately distorted. Macbeth's hamartia is traditionally identified as ambition, but this reading is insufficient: ambition alone would produce a political drama, not a tragedy. What makes Macbeth tragic is his imagination -- the capacity to see, in horrifying detail, the moral consequences of what he is about to do ('his virtues will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against the deep damnation of his taking-off') and to do it anyway. This is not a flaw of ignorance but of will, which makes Macbeth closer to Milton's Satan than to Oedipus. The peripeteia (reversal) is also complicated. In classical tragedy, the reversal is external -- fate turns against the hero. In 'Macbeth', the reversal is internal: the murder of Duncan, which Macbeth commits to seize control, initiates a psychological disintegration that strips him of the very agency he sought. By Act 5, the man who killed to become king cannot feel anything: 'I have almost forgot the taste of fears.' Shakespeare uses the convention of the soliloquy to chart this trajectory -- from the agonised moral reasoning of 'Is this a dagger' to the nihilistic 'Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow' -- making the soliloquy not just a window into thought but a measure of what has been lost. The anagnorisis (recognition) is the most contested element. Does Macbeth achieve self-knowledge? 'Tomorrow and tomorrow' might be read as existential insight -- the recognition that his choices have emptied life of meaning -- or as the final failure of understanding, a man who blames 'a tale told by an idiot' rather than acknowledging his own authorship of the catastrophe. This ambiguity is Shakespeare's most sophisticated subversion of tragic convention: he denies the audience the cathartic resolution that classical tragedy provides. We do not leave the play feeling that justice has been done and order restored. We leave it haunted by the possibility that Macbeth was right -- that all the sound and fury signified nothing.*

### Secondary concept: Shakespearean Language Analysis (ELT-KS4-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Close analysis of Shakespeare's lexical, syntactic and figurative choices, including his use of imagery (particularly extended metaphors and metaphorical clusters), puns, wordplay, rhetorical structures, inverted syntax, archaisms, and the semantic range of Early Modern English vocabulary.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify figurative language in Shakespeare (e.g. spots a metaphor or simile) but struggles with the density of Shakespeare's imagery and tends to paraphrase rather than analyse. | Translating the metaphor into modern English without analysing the effect of Shakespeare's specific word choices; Identifying the vehicle of the metaphor ('a horse jumping') but not connecting it to the play's themes |
| **Developing** | Analyses Shakespeare's language choices with some precision, exploring connotations of specific words and connecting imagery to character or theme, though analysis may be limited to one or two features per extract. | Analysing individual words without connecting them to the overall image pattern of the speech; Identifying what the imagery means but not how it functions as dramatic language -- how would this sound to an audience? |
| **Secure** | Analyses Shakespeare's language at multiple levels simultaneously -- lexical choice, imagery, syntax, sound -- and traces image patterns across the whole play, connecting specific moments to broader thematic development. | Tracing an image across the play without analysing the specific language of each instance; Identifying the image cluster without explaining how Shakespeare transforms its meaning across different dramatic contexts |
| **Mastery** | Produces sophisticated close readings of Shakespeare's language that engage with the full complexity of his imagery, syntax, sound and dramatic register, considering how multiple layers of meaning operate simultaneously and how language functions in performance. | Producing a comprehensive catalogue of techniques without building a sustained interpretive argument about what the language achieves as a whole; Analysing Shakespeare's language only as written text without considering its theatrical dimension -- how it sounds, how it would be performed, how it addresses an audience |

### Secondary concept: Elizabethan and Jacobean Context (ELT-KS4-C003)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

The social, political, religious and theatrical contexts that shaped Shakespeare's plays: the Elizabethan world picture (Great Chain of Being), attitudes to gender, kingship, witchcraft, race and class, the construction of the public playhouse, the role of patronage, and the political sensitivities of staging histories and tragedies.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows basic facts about the Elizabethan or Jacobean period but tends to include context as a separate paragraph rather than connecting it to specific textual choices. | Stating contextual facts without connecting them to specific moments in the text; Beginning a paragraph with 'In the Elizabethan era...' and narrating historical information that is never linked back to the play |
| **Developing** | Uses contextual knowledge to explain specific textual choices, connecting historical/social information to why a scene, character or speech has particular significance, though the connection may be surface-level. | Explaining the Divine Right of Kings accurately but not connecting it to a specific moment in the text; Treating the context as background rather than as something that shapes the meaning of specific language choices |
| **Secure** | Integrates contextual knowledge fluently into textual analysis, using context to illuminate why specific language, structural or dramatic choices resonate in their historical moment, without allowing context to substitute for close reading. | Using context to explain the audience's likely reaction without connecting it to the specific language Shakespeare chooses; Presenting contextual knowledge as certain when historical attitudes were diverse and contested |
| **Mastery** | Uses contextual knowledge with critical sophistication, recognising that context is not a fixed background but a contested set of attitudes that Shakespeare both reflects and challenges, and evaluating how different historical or critical frameworks produce different interpretations of the same text. | Presenting a single contextual reading as definitive rather than recognising that different contexts produce different but equally valid interpretations; Including multiple contexts but treating them as sequential paragraphs rather than showing how they interact, compete or illuminate different aspects of the same text |

### Secondary concept: Whole-Text Knowledge and Quotation Retention (ELT-KS4-C014)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The ability to demonstrate detailed knowledge of a complete literary text — novel, play or poetry selection — including the ability to recall and deploy relevant quotations accurately in a closed-book examination. Whole-text knowledge supports the ability to trace development of character, theme and technique across a complete work.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Knows the plot of the studied text and can recall a few key quotations, but quotations tend to be from the opening or the most famous scenes, and the student struggles to connect quotations to analytical points. | Using a quotation that is famous but not well-suited to the specific point being made; Including a quotation but not analysing its language -- the quotation sits in the response without doing analytical work |
| **Developing** | Can recall quotations from across the text (not just the opening or the most famous scenes) and uses them to support analytical points, though quotations may be long and imprecisely selected. | Selecting quotations that are longer than necessary -- a shorter, more precise quotation usually generates better analysis; Recalling quotations accurately from the early acts but becoming less precise for later parts of the text |
| **Secure** | Deploys memorised quotations precisely and strategically across the whole text, selecting short, analytically rich quotations that generate multiple points of analysis, and connecting specific textual moments to whole-text arguments. | Deploying quotations to illustrate the theme without using them to build a developing argument across the essay; Drawing on quotations from only two or three scenes rather than demonstrating knowledge of the whole text |
| **Mastery** | Demonstrates comprehensive and precise knowledge of the complete text, deploying quotations with strategic selectivity to build a complex and sustained argument, and using textual knowledge to connect specific moments to whole-text patterns, contextual significance and critical debates. | Demonstrating extensive quotation recall but not using it strategically -- quantity of quotation is less important than precision and analytical yield; Drawing on well-known quotations without demonstrating knowledge of less frequently discussed scenes that would strengthen the argument |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Shakespearean dramatic conventions (blank verse, soliloquy, aside, dramatic irony) and language analysis are structure-function skills — pupils explain how specific structural features of Shakespeare's craft create dramatic and thematic effects on an audience.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- How do structural features at different scales interact to produce this function?
- What structural constraints limit what this system can do?
- Why have unrelated organisms evolved similar structures for similar functions?
- How would you apply structure-function analysis to improve this design?

**Secondary lens:** Perspective and Interpretation — Staging interpretation requires pupils to understand that a play script is a set of perspectival choices — different productions construct different readings of the same text, and analysing stagecraft means asking whose interpretation is being expressed.

---

## Session structure: Text Study (Literature)

### Text Study (Literature)
A KS4 literature study sequence designed for GCSE English Literature preparation. Contextualises the text within its literary and historical period, develops close reading skills, applies literary analysis using subject terminology, supports comparison across texts, and scaffolds essay writing in exam-appropriate formats.

`context_setting` → `close_reading` → `literary_analysis` → `comparison` → `essay_writing`

**Assessment:** Timed essay response in GCSE format demonstrating close textual analysis, use of literary terminology, contextual understanding, and structured argument with embedded quotations.

**Teacher note:** Use the LITERATURE TEXT STUDY template: establish the historical, social, and literary context of the text. Guide close reading with attention to language, form, structure, and the effects on the reader. Expect analysis using precise literary terminology and comparison with other texts where appropriate. Develop essay writing skills including thesis construction, embedded quotation, and sustained analytical argument in line with GCSE assessment objectives.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does the writer use language, form, and structure to create meaning?
- What is the significance of this passage in the context of the whole text?
- How does the social or historical context shape our understanding of this text?
- How would you construct an essay that analyses this text with reference to the assessment objectives?

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Drama
**Features to teach:** imagery of blood, darkness, and sleeplessness as guilt markers, the witches as structural devices and thematic catalysts, Lady Macbeth's disintegration (5.1 sleepwalking scene), Jacobean audience's belief in witchcraft and the supernatural

**Writing outcome:** Write an analytical essay (600-800 words) exploring how Shakespeare uses the supernatural to present guilt in Macbeth, integrating contextual knowledge of Jacobean attitudes to witchcraft

**Literary terms:** imagery, motif, symbolism, pathetic fallacy, soliloquy, aside, foreshadowing

---

## Genre

- **Drama:** Dramatic literature studied for its theatrical and literary qualities. Distinct from KS1-KS2 playscript writing: at KS3-KS4, drama means studying published plays as literary texts, analysing dramatic conventions, and understanding performance context. Shakespeare study is the dominant form at KS4.

---

## Set texts

- **The Tragedy of Macbeth** by William Shakespeare

---

## Why this study matters

This second Macbeth unit addresses the supernatural and guilt themes — the second most common essay focus after ambition. Separating ambition from guilt allows deeper analytical work on each. The supernatural thread (witches, hallucinations, sleepwalking) provides an accessible entry point for AO3 contextual work because Jacobean attitudes to witchcraft are well-documented and genuinely interesting to students.

---

## Sequencing

**Follows:** Macbeth: Ambition and Moral Decline

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Treating the witches as either 'real' or 'not real' rather than exploring their dramatic function
2. Context about James I and Daemonologie presented as facts to memorise rather than as evidence for analysis
3. Blood imagery discussed without tracking its development across the play's structure
