## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Formal Presentation and Speech (ENL-KS4-C011)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

The ability to deliver a well-structured, purposeful and audience-appropriate presentation or speech using Standard English, varied vocal delivery, and appropriate non-verbal communication including gesture and eye contact.

**Teaching guidance:** For the spoken language endorsement, students must demonstrate clear organisation, adaptation to audience, and use of Standard English. Teach students to structure their presentation with a clear opening, sequenced body and memorable conclusion. Encourage use of visual aids where appropriate. Students should practise controlling pace, volume and emphasis — recording themselves allows for self-review. Questions and challenges should be anticipated and planned for. Assessment criteria: fluency, range of vocabulary, control of Standard English, organisation, interaction with audience.

**Key vocabulary:** presentation, speech, Standard English, vocal delivery, register, formal, structure, audience, eye contact, pace, emphasis, non-verbal communication, fluency

**Common misconceptions:** Students often read directly from notes rather than speaking to the audience. Students may neglect to adapt their language register to the formality of the context. Some students struggle to sustain a presentation beyond an opening, having not planned the full sequence of their talk.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can speak to a group but relies heavily on reading from notes, uses informal language in formal contexts, and does not structure the talk with a clear beginning, middle and end. | Give a two-minute presentation to the class on a topic you feel strongly about. You should speak clearly and use Standard English. | Relying on filler words ('like', 'basically', 'so yeah') rather than pausing confidently; Not preparing a clear structure -- beginning with the argument rather than establishing context |
| **Developing** | Delivers a structured presentation with a clear opening, body and conclusion, uses Standard English mostly consistently, and makes some eye contact with the audience. | Prepare and deliver a three-minute presentation arguing for a change you would like to see in your local community. Use Standard English and engage your audience. | Maintaining a single pace and tone throughout without varying emphasis for key points; Making eye contact only intermittently, reverting to reading from notes during the most important sections |
| **Secure** | Delivers a well-paced, clearly structured presentation that adapts to the audience, uses varied vocal delivery (pace, emphasis, pause) for effect, and handles questions from the audience with composure. | Deliver a five-minute presentation on a social issue you care about. You will be asked questions by the audience afterwards. Your presentation should be well-structured, use Standard English, and engage your audience through vocal delivery and eye contact. | Delivering a well-prepared presentation but struggling to adapt when questions challenge the argument; Using pauses and emphasis effectively in the prepared sections but reverting to a flat delivery when responding to questions |
| **Mastery** | Delivers a polished, compelling presentation that demonstrates complete command of spoken Standard English, sophisticated audience engagement, confident handling of challenges, and the ability to think on their feet while maintaining formal register. | Deliver a presentation and participate in a follow-up discussion on a controversial topic. You must present a clear argument, respond to challenges, and demonstrate the ability to adapt your position in response to new points without losing coherence. | Delivering a flawless prepared presentation but becoming defensive rather than genuinely responsive when challenged; Conceding points strategically but not genuinely -- audiences can detect inauthentic concessions |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *So, um, I am going to talk about why school should start later. Basically, teenagers need more sleep and like, the science says we should be sleeping till about 9am. So yeah, it is really unfair that school starts at 8:30 because we are all tired. And also, like, other countries have tried it and it works. So yeah, that is basically it.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *[Delivered with notes as prompts, not read verbatim] Good morning. I want to talk to you about something that affects everyone in this room: the lack of safe cycling routes in our town. There are currently no dedicated cycle lanes on any of the main roads between here and the town centre. As a result, cyclists share the road with buses, lorries and cars, often at rush hour. Last year, three cyclists were injured on the A412 alone. My proposal is straightforward: convert the unused pavement on the north side of the High Street into a segregated cycle lane. The pavement is already wide enough, the cost would be modest, and the precedent has been set in neighbouring towns. I would like this council to commission a feasibility study before the next budget cycle. Thank you.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *[Delivered without notes, using confident eye contact and deliberate pacing] I am going to ask you a question, and I would like you to answer honestly. [Pause] When was the last time you had a conversation -- a real conversation, face to face, lasting more than ten minutes -- with someone over the age of seventy? [Pause] If you are struggling to remember, you are not alone. We live in a society that segregates by age more than almost any other variable. Children in schools, adults in offices, elderly people in care homes. And the result is a loneliness epidemic that affects 1.4 million older adults in the UK -- people who go entire weeks without speaking to another person. [Continues with evidence, personal anecdote, and a concrete proposal for an intergenerational community programme] [Responding to a question: 'How would you fund this?'] That is a fair challenge, and I want to answer it honestly rather than dodge it. The programme I described would require approximately twelve thousand pounds a year for the coordinator role. My suggestion is that this could come from the existing community grants budget, which currently funds programmes with lower evidence of impact. But I would also argue that the real cost is what we are already paying -- in NHS mental health referrals, in social care interventions, in the human cost of isolation. Prevention is always cheaper than cure.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *[Delivered with authority, varied pacing, and deliberate use of gesture and pause] I want to begin with a paradox. We live in the most informed generation in human history and the least trusted. We have access to more data than any civilisation before us, and yet public trust in experts -- scientists, doctors, economists -- has fallen to its lowest point in decades. [Builds argument about the relationship between information overload and epistemic distrust, using three carefully chosen examples] [In discussion, responding to a peer who argues that distrust of experts is rational given historical failures:] You make an important point, and I want to engage with it seriously rather than dismiss it. You are right that experts have been wrong -- the financial crisis, the WMD intelligence, the initial Covid modelling. These failures are real and they matter. But I would distinguish between two responses to expert failure. One is healthy scepticism: demanding better evidence, more transparency, clearer communication of uncertainty. The other is wholesale rejection: the idea that because experts have sometimes been wrong, expertise itself is worthless. The first response strengthens knowledge. The second destroys it. And I worry that we are increasingly choosing the second. What I would concede, though -- and this is a genuine revision of my earlier argument -- is that the fault lies not only with the public but with experts themselves, who have not always been honest about the limits of their knowledge. If we want trust rebuilt, that rebuilding has to come from both sides.*

### Secondary concept: Discussion, Debate and Collaborative Talk (ENL-KS4-C012)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

The ability to listen actively, build on others' contributions, develop and defend a position, challenge politely and constructively, and sustain extended academic discussion. Includes structured debate formats and Socratic seminar models.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Participates in discussions when prompted but tends to either dominate without listening or remain silent, and does not use formal discussion conventions. | Dismissing others' points without engaging with the substance of what they said; Not building on previous contributions -- each response starts from scratch rather than developing the discussion |
| **Developing** | Engages with others' points using some discussion conventions (acknowledging, challenging politely, building on ideas) but may struggle to sustain these behaviours throughout an extended discussion. | Listening to respond rather than listening to understand -- preparing a rebuttal before the other person has finished; Sustaining polite challenge in the early stages of the debate but becoming more combative as the discussion intensifies |
| **Secure** | Participates fluently in structured discussions and debates, demonstrating active listening, well-supported challenges, the ability to build on others' contributions, and sustained use of Standard English. | Making strong contributions individually but not facilitating others' participation; Referencing texts superficially rather than integrating them substantively into the discussion |
| **Mastery** | Leads and facilitates complex discussions with intellectual confidence, adapts position in response to new arguments, synthesises multiple contributions into a coherent summary, and models the conventions of academic discourse. | Facilitating the discussion but subtly steering it towards a predetermined conclusion rather than genuinely engaging with all positions; Synthesising contributions accurately but not identifying the underlying point of disagreement that structures the debate |

## Thinking lens: Evidence and Argument (primary)

**Key question:** What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?

**Why this lens fits:** GCSE spoken language assessment requires pupils to construct and sustain arguments in formal spoken contexts — both formal presentations and structured discussion demand claim-evidence-reasoning sequences delivered with command.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- How does the methodology affect the strength of this evidence?
- Is this argument logically valid, regardless of whether you agree with the conclusion?
- What logical fallacy, if any, weakens this argument?
- How would you weigh these competing bodies of evidence to reach a justified conclusion?

**Secondary lens:** Perspective and Interpretation — Formal presentations and collaborative discussion require pupils to adapt to audience perspective, engage with others' contributions, and position their own viewpoint clearly in relation to the views of others.

---

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Non Fiction
**Features to teach:** formal spoken English register, presentation structure (introduction, developed argument, conclusion), responding to questions and challenges, use of Standard English in formal contexts

**Writing outcome:** Prepare and deliver a formal presentation (3-5 minutes) on a topic of personal interest, demonstrating Standard English, structured argument, and the ability to respond to questions

---

## Genre

- **Transactional:** Purpose-driven non-fiction forms written for a specific audience and context. The KS3-KS4 progression from KS2 persuasion and discussion: at GCSE, transactional writing encompasses all non-fiction forms (letter, article, speech, review, report) and is assessed on audience awareness, register control, and rhetorical effectiveness. The most frequently examined writing form on GCSE Language Paper 2.

## Why this study matters

The Spoken Language Endorsement is a separate, non-examined assessment (Pass, Merit, Distinction) that appears on the GCSE certificate. While it does not affect the grade, it is statutory and develops the oracy skills essential for adult life. The formal presentation format tests students' ability to use Standard English in a public context, structure an argument, and respond to challenge — skills transferable to interviews, university seminars, and workplace communication.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Presentation is read from notes with no eye contact or audience engagement
2. Standard English lapses into informal register when responding to questions
3. Content is descriptive rather than argumentative — no clear thesis or developed reasoning
4. Students rush through without attention to pace, pause, and emphasis
