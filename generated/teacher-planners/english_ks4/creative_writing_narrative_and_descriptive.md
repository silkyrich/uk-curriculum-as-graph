## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Narrative and Descriptive Writing (ENL-KS4-C009)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The craft of creating imaginative and engaging narrative or descriptive pieces, including character construction, setting and atmosphere, narrative perspective, narrative tension, and the use of sensory detail and figurative language to engage the reader.

**Teaching guidance:** Creative writing (Paper 1, AO5 and AO6) is assessed on quality and accuracy of writing, not on plot complexity. Teach students that examiners reward: original and sustained writing voice; precise and unexpected vocabulary choices; effective structure (a strong opening hook, a meaningful ending); varied sentence structures for effect; and vivid, controlled use of imagery. Encourage students to plan before writing — even a 5-minute plan should sketch the arc of the piece and 2–3 key image or language choices. Students should write from a position of control, not simply narrating events. Descriptive writing can be still and atmospheric; narrative writing needs some sense of movement or change.

**Key vocabulary:** narrative, description, perspective, first person, third person, omniscient narrator, characterisation, setting, atmosphere, tension, imagery, sensory language, figurative language, pacing, dialogue

**Common misconceptions:** Students often over-plot their narratives, cramming in events at the expense of language quality. Students may use clichéd figurative language ('her eyes were like stars') rather than original imagery. Some students write descriptions as lists of adjectives rather than crafted, layered prose that creates a distinct atmosphere.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can write a basic narrative with a beginning, middle and end, but tends to rely on plot events rather than language quality, and descriptions are limited to simple adjectives. | Write a description of a place that is mysterious or unsettling. Focus on creating atmosphere through your language choices. | Telling the reader the place is 'scary' rather than creating a scary atmosphere through description; Using generic adjectives ('old', 'dark', 'cold') rather than precise, original language |
| **Developing** | Creates some effective descriptive moments using figurative language and sensory detail, and attempts to structure narrative for effect, though the quality is inconsistent. | Write the opening of a narrative that begins with a character waking up in an unfamiliar place. Focus on creating a strong atmosphere and engaging the reader immediately. | Starting with strong descriptive language but allowing it to weaken as the piece continues; Using figurative language that is cliched rather than original ('her heart pounded like a drum') |
| **Secure** | Writes sustained narrative or descriptive pieces with controlled structure, original imagery, varied sentence types for deliberate effect, and a consistent authorial voice. | Write a narrative that begins with the line 'The last time I saw the house, it looked nothing like I remembered.' You may continue the narrative in any direction. Focus on quality of writing. | Over-writing -- using too many figurative devices in succession so that each individual image loses its impact; Neglecting sentence variation -- writing only in long, complex sentences without using short ones for contrast and emphasis |
| **Mastery** | Produces narrative or descriptive writing of exceptional quality: a distinctive and sustained voice, precise and original imagery, structural choices that reinforce meaning, and language that creates multiple layers of effect simultaneously. | Write a piece of descriptive writing suggested by this image: a single chair in an empty room, lit by a window. You may write about any subject related to this image. | Producing technically accomplished writing that lacks emotional depth or a distinctive perspective; Allowing the desire for poetic language to overwhelm clarity of meaning |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *The house was old and scary. The windows were broken and the door was hanging off. Inside, it was dark and cold. There were cobwebs everywhere and the stairs were creaky. I did not want to go further but I did.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Light. Too much of it, and from the wrong direction. She blinked, and the ceiling resolved itself -- white tiles, fluorescent strips, the institutional glow of somewhere that never fully sleeps. The air tasted of disinfectant and something underneath it, something metallic. A hospital, then. But she could not remember how she had arrived, and that absence -- the gap where a memory should have been -- sat in her chest like a stone. From somewhere down the corridor, a trolley rattled past. She counted its wheels on the linoleum: one-two, one-two, one-two. It was easier to count than to think.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *The last time I saw the house, it looked nothing like I remembered. Which is to say: it looked exactly as it was, and it was my memory that had lied. I had carried it for years as something grand -- the garden enormous, the hallway endless, the kitchen a cathedral of steam and Sunday noise. Now it sat on its patch of road like a tooth in the wrong mouth: small, off-white, slightly crooked. The gate I had swung on as a child came up to my hip. I let myself in. The garden had not so much grown as surrendered: bindweed through the fence, a buddleia muscling up through the patio slabs, its purple heads nodding in the traffic breeze like a congregation at prayer. Inside, the hallway was four steps long. I counted. As a child, it had taken me ten. The wallpaper was the same -- brown flowers on cream -- but peeling now at the joins, curling away from the wall as though trying to leave. I pressed it back with my thumb and it stayed for a moment, then lifted again. Some things do not want to be put back. The kitchen was empty. Not just empty of people, but empty of the particular quality of occupied space -- the weight of someone recently there, the residual warmth of a kettle, a chair pushed out at the angle of someone who plans to return. This emptiness was total. The kind that has been empty for long enough to forget it was ever anything else.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *The chair faces the window as though waiting for a conversation. It is wooden, straight-backed, the kind that does not invite you to stay -- the kind bought for function in an era that did not apologise for discomfort. Its seat is worn to a shallow curve by years of the same body, the same weight, the same afternoon arrangement: chair to window, window to garden, garden to the slow accumulation of seasons. The room offers nothing else. Bare walls, bare boards, and a quality of light that arrives already tired, as though it has passed through too many panes to carry warmth by the time it reaches the floor. This is not emptiness as absence. It is emptiness as choice -- the careful subtraction of everything that does not serve the view. Someone sat here and decided that the world beyond the glass was enough. The garden is visible in strips through the condensation: a hedge, mathematically straight; a square of lawn; a path that runs to the gate and stops. Nothing is overgrown. Nothing is accidental. Even the condensation follows a pattern, thickest at the base where warm air meets cold glass, thinning upward until the sky appears -- clear, pale, indifferent. I think of the body that shaped this seat. How they must have arrived each afternoon at the same hour, lowered themselves with the same controlled care, adjusted the same cushion that is no longer there. How the window must have held their reflection before the light changed and the reflection dissolved into the garden behind it, so that for a moment they were both inside and outside, both here and gone. The chair is still here. The body is not. But the room has not noticed the difference, or has decided not to mention it. The light arrives at the same angle. The seat holds its curve. And the window continues its long, one-sided conversation with whoever is willing to sit down and listen.*

### Secondary concept: Audience, Purpose and Form (ENL-KS4-C007)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Understanding the relationship between the intended audience of a piece of writing, its purpose (to argue, inform, persuade, describe, narrate, entertain), and the form it takes (letter, speech, article, review, narrative). Writers adapt all aspects of their writing — vocabulary, tone, structure, register — to serve audience, purpose and form.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Writes with a general sense of audience (e.g. knows to be more formal for a letter to a headteacher) but does not consistently adapt tone, vocabulary or structure to match the demands of the task. | Using informal register ('rubbish', 'loads of') in a formal letter without recognising the mismatch; Not sustaining the letter form throughout -- forgetting conventions like formal sign-off |
| **Developing** | Demonstrates awareness of audience, purpose and form and makes deliberate choices to adapt writing accordingly, though the adaptation may be inconsistent or over-simplified. | Maintaining a formal tone throughout without varying it for rhetorical effect; Following the conventions of one form (e.g. article with headline) but losing the audience-awareness within the body of the text |
| **Secure** | Adapts tone, register, vocabulary and structural conventions confidently and consistently to match audience, purpose and form, demonstrating awareness of how these three elements interact. | Adopting a formal speech register that sounds artificial when addressing peers; Forgetting to use spoken-language features (direct address, rhetorical questions, varied pacing) that distinguish a speech from an essay |
| **Mastery** | Controls audience, purpose and form with sophisticated precision, modulating register within a piece for deliberate effect and demonstrating critical awareness of how writing conventions shape the reader's response. | Maintaining a single tone throughout rather than modulating register for rhetorical variety (serious argument, concession, analogy, direct address); Using sophisticated vocabulary without ensuring it serves clarity and effect rather than mere display |

### Secondary concept: Sentence Structure and Syntax for Effect (ENL-KS4-C013)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The ability to consciously vary sentence structures — simple, compound, complex and compound-complex — to create pacing, emphasis, rhythm and reader engagement. Students should understand how syntax choices (fronted adverbials, passive voice, embedded clauses, short sentences for impact) function as deliberate craft choices.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Writes mostly in simple and compound sentences, with limited variation in sentence openings and occasional errors in complex sentence construction. | Varying sentence length without varying sentence structure -- a short sentence and a long sentence that both begin 'subject + verb' is not genuine structural variety; Attempting complex sentences but creating run-on sentences or comma splices |
| **Developing** | Uses a range of sentence structures including complex sentences with subordinate clauses, and begins to vary sentence openings (fronted adverbials, participial phrases), though the variety may feel mechanical rather than purposeful. | Using fronted adverbials and participial openers so frequently that they become a new kind of monotony; Varying sentence structures for the sake of variety without considering which structure best serves the meaning |
| **Secure** | Selects sentence structures deliberately to create specific effects -- short sentences for impact, complex sentences for nuance, fragments for dramatic emphasis -- and can explain why specific syntactic choices are effective in both their own writing and published texts. | Explaining what sentence structures do in general terms ('short sentences create tension') without analysing why that specific short sentence in that specific context creates that specific effect; Writing effectively in one register (e.g. complex, literary prose) but not demonstrating the ability to control contrasting registers |
| **Mastery** | Deploys syntax as a fully integrated element of style, using sentence structure not just for variety but as a meaning-making tool that reinforces content, controls pacing, and positions the reader, with the same analytical precision applied to both reading and writing. | Analysing sentence structure in isolation from content -- syntactic analysis must always connect form to meaning; Imitating a syntactic technique without adapting it to a different purpose, producing pastiche rather than original application |

### Secondary concept: Vocabulary Range and Precision (ENL-KS4-C014)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The ability to choose vocabulary that is precise, varied and appropriate to purpose and context, demonstrating a wide lexical range. Vocabulary choices should be evaluated in reading contexts and deployed deliberately in writing.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Uses a basic vocabulary that is adequate for communication but lacks precision, variety or awareness of register, with frequent repetition of common words. | Replacing common words with longer words that are not necessarily more precise ('utilise' instead of 'use' does not improve precision); Not considering whether the replacement word fits the register and tone of the writing |
| **Developing** | Selects vocabulary with increasing precision and awareness of connotation, uses some subject-specific terminology in analytical writing, and avoids obvious repetition. | Discussing vocabulary choices at the level of 'positive' and 'negative' connotations without specifying what associations the word activates; Using sophisticated vocabulary in analysis ('the writer juxtaposes') but not in creative writing, or vice versa |
| **Secure** | Deploys vocabulary with consistent precision in both analytical and creative writing, demonstrating awareness of denotation, connotation and register, and using lexical choices to create specific effects. | Achieving precise vocabulary in creative writing but reverting to generic analytical vocabulary ('effective', 'powerful', 'creates an atmosphere'); Using sophisticated vocabulary inconsistently -- a precise word choice followed by several vague ones undermines the overall effect |
| **Mastery** | Demonstrates exceptional lexical range and precision in all forms of writing, selecting vocabulary that operates on multiple levels simultaneously and creating effects that depend on the reader's sensitivity to nuance, connotation and semantic field. | Analysing vocabulary at a single level (denotation or connotation) without exploring how the same word operates across multiple registers; Selecting vocabulary for sophistication rather than precision -- the best word is not always the most complex one |

### Secondary concept: Punctuation and Spelling Accuracy (ENL-KS4-C015)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Accurate and deliberate use of the full range of punctuation marks and consistent, accurate spelling of a wide vocabulary. Punctuation should function both for grammatical accuracy and for stylistic effect — for example, using a colon to introduce an idea with drama, or a dash to signal a parenthetical aside.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Uses basic punctuation (full stops, capital letters, commas) mostly correctly but makes frequent errors with apostrophes, and avoids higher-level punctuation marks. Spelling of common words is generally accurate but errors increase with more ambitious vocabulary. | Confusing 'their', 'there' and 'they're', or 'its' and 'it's'; Using commas to join two complete sentences (comma splice) instead of a full stop, semi-colon or conjunction |
| **Developing** | Uses commas, apostrophes and speech marks correctly in most contexts, attempts higher-level punctuation (semi-colons, colons, dashes) with some accuracy, and spells most words correctly including commonly misspelled ones. | Using a semi-colon where a colon is needed, or vice versa; Misspelling words that are attempted precisely because they are ambitious -- e.g. 'definately', 'seperate', 'occassion' |
| **Secure** | Deploys the full range of punctuation marks accurately and for deliberate effect, and spells a wide vocabulary correctly and consistently, including subject-specific and literary terminology. | Using higher-level punctuation marks correctly but not exploiting their stylistic potential; Spelling ambitious vocabulary correctly in careful work but making errors under timed conditions |
| **Mastery** | Demonstrates flawless technical accuracy across extended writing under timed conditions, with punctuation functioning as a fully integrated element of style and meaning, and spelling that is consistently accurate even with the most ambitious vocabulary. | Maintaining accuracy in the opening paragraphs but allowing errors to creep in during the final third of timed writing; Deploying technically correct punctuation that nonetheless fails to enhance the writing's clarity or style |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Narrative and descriptive writing with craft requires pupils to make deliberate structural choices (narrative arc, descriptive sequence, sentence variety) that serve the function of sustaining the reader's interest and creating a specific imaginative effect.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- How do structural features at different scales interact to produce this function?
- What structural constraints limit what this system can do?
- Why have unrelated organisms evolved similar structures for similar functions?
- How would you apply structure-function analysis to improve this design?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Rhetorical devices, persuasive techniques and transactional writing forms are all tools for constructing arguments adapted to audience — the cognitive demand is selecting the most effective evidence and rhetorical strategies for the specific persuasive task.

---

## Session structure: Writer's Workshop

### Writer's Workshop
A process-writing sequence that develops pupils as independent writers. Studies a mentor text to identify craft techniques, practises those techniques in isolation, plans an original piece, drafts with attention to audience and purpose, engages in peer review for feedback, revises and edits, and publishes the final piece.

`mentor_text` → `technique_identification` → `planning` → `drafting` → `peer_review` → `editing` → `publication`

**Assessment:** Final published piece demonstrating identified craft techniques, with writing portfolio showing development through the drafting and revision process.

**Teacher note:** Use the WRITER'S WORKSHOP template: analyse a mentor text at a sophisticated level, examining the relationship between technique, purpose, and audience. Expect independent and purposeful drafting that demonstrates control of a range of techniques. Facilitate critical peer review and self-editing focused on precision, style, and the overall quality of written communication. Develop exam-standard writing that meets GCSE assessment objectives for accuracy, impact, and crafted expression.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does the mentor text balance technique with authenticity and voice?
- What range of techniques have you deployed, and how effectively do they serve your purpose?
- How would you evaluate the quality of your writing against GCSE assessment objectives?
- What final revisions would elevate your writing from competent to compelling?

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Fiction
**Features to teach:** controlled narrative voice (first or third person), descriptive techniques (sensory detail, figurative language, pathetic fallacy), structural control (opening hook, shift, climax, resolution), vocabulary range and sentence variety for effect

**Writing outcome:** Write a narrative or descriptive piece (450-600 words) in response to a visual or textual prompt, demonstrating controlled voice, varied sentence structures, ambitious vocabulary, and effective structural choices under timed conditions

**Literary terms:** narrative voice, sensory detail, figurative language, pathetic fallacy, cyclical structure, juxtaposition

---

## Genre

- **Narrative:** Extended prose fiction with characters, setting, and a plot driven by conflict and resolution. The dominant literary form across all key stages, progressing from simple retelling (KS1) through structured narrative (KS2) to literary fiction with controlled voice and style (KS3-KS4).
- **Creative Writing:** Creative composition assessed as a GCSE exam component, encompassing narrative and descriptive writing. Distinct from KS2 narrative because creative writing at KS4 is a timed exam skill requiring conscious technical control under pressure. Students must demonstrate a range of vocabulary, sentence structures, and structural techniques within a single piece.

---

## Why this study matters

Creative writing on Paper 1 carries 40 marks (25% of the GCSE) and is where many students earn or lose their target grade. The key is teaching students that 'creative' does not mean 'write whatever you want' — it means deploying specific techniques deliberately for effect. Regular practice with visual prompts builds the timed-writing stamina and range of structural templates students need. Quality over quantity: 450 focused words beat 800 unfocused words.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Writing too much and losing control of structure and accuracy
2. Opening with a weather description rather than an engaging hook
3. Figurative language piled on without consideration of overall effect
4. No structural planning leading to a story that trails off without a satisfying ending
