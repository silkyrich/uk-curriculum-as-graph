## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **5 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Regional Place Study and Cross-Continental Comparison (GE-KS2-C006)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Place study at a regional scale involves developing in-depth understanding of a geographical region: its physical landscape, climate, vegetation, resources, settlement patterns, economic activity and cultural character. At KS2, pupils study three contrasting regions — a UK region, a European region, and a region within North or South America — comparing their human and physical characteristics across continental contexts. Understanding regions in depth, and comparing across continents, develops the geographical knowledge base and the comparative analytical skills that underpin sophisticated geographical thinking. The cross-continental frame ensures that pupils encounter genuinely diverse human geographies, building awareness of how physical geography (climate, relief, resources) shapes human activity in different parts of the world.

**Teaching guidance:** Choose regions that offer genuine contrast: a mountainous Alpine region in Europe compared with a UK lowland region; an Amazonian region compared with a Caribbean island. Structure each regional study using a consistent inquiry framework: location (where is it?), physical geography (what is the landscape and climate like?), human geography (how do people live and work?), change (how is the region changing?), comparison (how does it compare to the other regions studied?). Use maps, photographs, satellite images, statistical data and firsthand accounts. Avoid reducing regions to stereotypes; show their internal diversity and dynamism. Return to the regions studied across the primary years rather than treating each as a one-off topic.

**Key vocabulary:** region, continent, country, European, Americas, compare, physical geography, human geography, characteristic, settlement, economic activity, climate, landscape, cultural, similarities, differences

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may treat regional studies as discrete topics rather than as recurring reference points for geographical comparison. Returning to studied regions in different thematic contexts (rivers, climate, development) builds richer knowledge than treating each as a one-off study. Pupils may characterise regions by only one or two features, missing the complexity and internal diversity of real regions. Requiring pupils to update their knowledge of studied regions over time prevents oversimplification.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying basic facts about a studied region: its location, one physical feature and one human feature. | Tell me three facts about the region of Europe we have been studying. | Confusing facts about different regions studied; Giving very general statements that could apply to any region |
| **Developing** | Describing the physical and human geography of a studied region using specific geographical vocabulary. | Describe the physical and human geography of the Amazon region in South America. | Describing only physical OR only human geography, not both; Using vague language instead of specific geographical vocabulary |
| **Expected** | Comparing two regions from different continents, identifying similarities and differences in their physical and human geography, and explaining reasons for the differences. | Compare the Lake District in the UK with a region in the Amazon. How and why are they different? | Listing differences without explaining the geographical reasons behind them; Only comparing one dimension (climate) and ignoring economy, population, or land use |
| **Greater Depth** | Evaluating how global issues (climate change, trade, migration) affect studied regions differently, and considering multiple perspectives on regional change. | How might climate change affect the Lake District and the Amazon region differently? Who would be most affected in each place? | Discussing climate change impacts on only one region; Not recognising that different groups within a region are affected differently |

> **Model response (Entry):** *We studied the Alps in Europe. The Alps are very high mountains with snow on top. People ski there in the winter.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *The Amazon region has the world's largest tropical rainforest with dense vegetation and the Amazon River, which is one of the longest rivers. The climate is hot and wet all year. Indigenous communities live in the forest. There is also logging, mining and cattle farming, which are changing the landscape.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *The Lake District has a temperate climate with cool, wet weather and is at a high latitude. The Amazon is tropical with constant heat and heavy rain, near the Equator. The Lake District's economy depends on tourism and sheep farming; the Amazon has logging, farming and indigenous communities. The differences are mainly because of their locations — latitude determines climate, which determines vegetation and how people make a living.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *Climate change could bring more flooding to the Lake District, damaging tourism and farmland. In the Amazon, higher temperatures and drought could cause forest dieback, affecting indigenous communities who depend on the forest and releasing carbon that accelerates global warming. Farmers clearing forest might benefit short-term but cause long-term damage. The impacts are connected — deforestation in the Amazon affects global climate, which affects weather in the Lake District.*

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** Linking latitude bands to climate zones introduces the idea that global climate patterns are not random but follow predictable spatial regularities tied to distance from the equator and angle of incoming solar radiation.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- What pattern can you see?
- Does this always happen, or can you find an exception?
- What rule connects these examples?
- What would you predict for the next one? Why?

**Secondary lens:** Scale, Proportion and Quantity — Latitude and longitude are quantitative coordinate systems; the cognitive demand is understanding how degrees of arc translate to position on a sphere and why latitude predicts climate — reasoning about proportion and quantity in a spatial context.

## Session structure: Place Study

### Place Study
An in-depth geographical study of a specific place at local, national, or global scale. Pupils orient themselves within the place, use maps and spatial data, collect information about its physical and human features, analyse geographical processes, compare with other places, and evaluate change or issues.

`orientation` → `mapping` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `comparison` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Place study report combining map work, data presentation, descriptive and explanatory writing about geographical features and processes, and comparative or evaluative conclusion.

**Teacher note:** Use the PLACE STUDY template: introduce a place using maps at different scales, photographs, and data. Guide pupils to collect information about physical and human features, present findings using maps, charts, or writing, and compare the place with another location. Encourage them to explain why the place is like it is.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What are the main physical and human features of this place?
- What does the map or data tell you that the photograph does not?
- How does this place compare to another place you have studied?
- Why is this place the way it is? What factors have shaped it?

## Contrasting localities

### UK Region vs European Region
The UK-Europe regional comparison develops pupils' analytical skills by requiring them to use a consistent comparison framework across two contrasting regions. The comparison should go beyond description to explanation: not just 'the Alps are higher than the Lake District' but 'why does this difference in relief affect farming, tourism, and settlement patterns?'

**Compare through:** climate and vegetation, relief and physical landscape, economic activity, settlement patterns, cultural character, land use
**Stimulus questions:**
- How is the physical landscape of the European region different from the UK region?
- How does climate affect the way people live and work in each region?
- What types of farming and economic activity are different, and why?
- Would you prefer to live in the UK region or the European region? Give geographical reasons.

## Why this study matters

The European regional study is a statutory requirement that extends pupils' geographical horizons beyond the UK to a contrasting European environment. Schools select a specific region, enabling comparison of how physical geography, climate, and culture shape human activity differently in a European context compared to the UK region already studied. This builds the comparative skills essential to geographical thinking.

## Sequencing

**Follows:** UK Regional Study

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Choosing a capital city as the 'region' — the NC specifies a region, not a city, to develop understanding of regional geography
2. Treating the European study as a tourism brochure — focus on geographical analysis, not travel highlights
3. Failing to compare systematically with the UK region — the value is in structured comparison, not standalone description

---

## Success criteria

**Pupils can:**
- Locate the European region on a map and describe its physical geography
- Identify at least 3 similarities and 3 differences with the UK region
- Explain how climate influences human activity in the European region
- Use geographical vocabulary accurately in comparison

## Geographical skills (KS2)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Using maps, atlases and globes** — Locating and identifying places in the United Kingdom and wider world using world maps, atlases and globes as reference tools, understanding that these are representations of the real world at reduced scale.
- **Using compass directions and locational language** — Applying the four cardinal compass directions (North, South, East, West) and everyday directional language such as near, far, left and right to describe the location of features and routes on maps and in the environment.
- **Using aerial photographs and making simple maps** — Interpreting aerial photographs and plan-perspective images to recognise landmarks and physical and human features, and translating these observations into a simple hand-drawn map with a basic symbol key.
- **Simple fieldwork and observational skills** — Going out into the school grounds and immediate surrounding environment to observe, describe and record human and physical geographical features at first hand, practising the habits of direct geographical enquiry.
- **Using maps, atlases, globes and digital mapping** — Extending atlas and map use to locate countries and describe the features studied across the curriculum, and beginning to use digital and computer mapping tools — including online satellite maps — to access geographical information in a range of formats.
- **Eight-point compass and Ordnance Survey map skills** — Applying the eight compass points, four-figure and six-figure grid references, and the symbols and conventions of Ordnance Survey maps to build knowledge of the UK and the wider world, and to navigate and locate features on topographic maps.
