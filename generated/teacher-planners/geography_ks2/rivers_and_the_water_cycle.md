## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **3 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: River Systems and the Water Cycle (GE-KS2-C003)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

A river system comprises a river and all its tributaries, flowing through a drainage basin from source to mouth. Rivers shape the landscape through the processes of erosion, transportation and deposition, creating characteristic landforms including valleys, meanders, ox-bow lakes, deltas and floodplains. The water cycle describes the continuous movement of water between ocean, atmosphere, land and rivers through processes of evaporation, condensation, precipitation, run-off and infiltration. At KS2, pupils develop understanding of both river processes and the wider hydrological cycle that sustains freshwater systems.

**Teaching guidance:** Use diagrams and models to explain the water cycle, connecting the processes to observable phenomena (clouds, rain, rivers, evaporation). Study a specific river system in detail: trace it from source to mouth on a map, identify key tributaries and settlements, study the features at different stages. Use photographs to study river landforms at different locations. Connect rivers to human activity: water supply, settlements, trade, flooding. Investigate local rivers or streams through fieldwork.

**Key vocabulary:** river, source, mouth, tributary, drainage basin, meander, flood plain, erosion, deposition, transportation, water cycle, evaporation, condensation, precipitation, run-off, infiltration

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often think rivers flow uphill at some point; careful explanation of how gravity determines flow direction addresses this. The water cycle is often presented too simplistically; exploring the variety of pathways water can take (groundwater, evapotranspiration, run-off) develops more accurate understanding. Pupils may not connect rivers to the water cycle; linking the discussion of river flow to rainfall and precipitation makes the connection explicit.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying the main stages of the water cycle (evaporation, condensation, precipitation) and labelling a simple diagram. | Label this water cycle diagram with the words: evaporation, condensation, precipitation. | Confusing evaporation and condensation; Thinking the water cycle only involves rain falling into the sea |
| **Developing** | Describing the water cycle as a continuous process and identifying the main features of a river from source to mouth. | Describe what happens to water from the moment it falls as rain on a mountain until it reaches the sea. | Thinking rivers only flow from mountains (some start from springs or lakes); Not recognising the continuous, cyclical nature of the process |
| **Expected** | Explaining how rivers shape the landscape through erosion, transportation and deposition, and identifying specific landforms created by these processes. | How does a river create a meander? What happens to the material that the river erodes? | Confusing erosion (wearing away) with deposition (building up); Not understanding that fast water erodes while slow water deposits |
| **Greater Depth** | Evaluating human interaction with rivers — how people use rivers, how flooding affects communities, and how humans modify river systems. | Rivers provide benefits but also pose risks. Explain how people manage this balance, using examples. | Presenting rivers as entirely beneficial or entirely dangerous; Not recognising that human actions upstream can cause problems downstream |

> **Model response (Entry):** *Evaporation is where water goes up from the sea. Condensation is where it forms clouds. Precipitation is where it falls as rain.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Rain falls on the mountain and flows downhill as small streams. Streams join together to form a river. The river flows through valleys, getting wider and slower as it reaches flatter land. Eventually it reaches the sea at the river's mouth. Then the water evaporates and the cycle starts again.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Water flows faster on the outside of a river bend, eroding the bank and making the curve larger. On the inside of the bend, the water flows more slowly so it drops the material it is carrying — this is deposition. Over time, the bends become larger and more curved, creating meanders. The eroded material is transported downstream and deposited where the river slows, forming features like floodplains and deltas at the river's mouth.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *Rivers provide water, transport, power and fertile floodplains for farming. But flooding destroys homes and infrastructure. People manage this by building flood defences, creating flood plains to absorb excess water, and using early warning systems. However, building on floodplains increases risk, and upstream deforestation makes flooding worse by increasing run-off. Managing rivers involves trade-offs between economic use and flood risk.*

### Secondary concept: Latitude, Longitude and the Global Grid (GE-KS2-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Latitude and longitude are a coordinate system used to identify any location on Earth's surface. Lines of latitude run parallel to the Equator and measure distance north or south (0-90 degrees); lines of longitude run from Pole to Pole and measure distance east or west of the Prime Meridian (0-180 degrees). Special lines of latitude - the Equator, Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, and the Arctic and Antarctic Circles - mark significant climatic boundaries. The Prime Meridian (0 degrees longitude) divides the Eastern and Western Hemispheres and is the reference for time zones. At KS2, pupils learn to use this system to locate and describe global position.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying the Equator, North Pole and South Pole on a globe and understanding that latitude lines run horizontally. | Confusing the Equator with the Prime Meridian; Thinking the Equator only passes through Africa |
| **Developing** | Identifying lines of latitude and longitude on a map and using them to describe approximate locations of countries and features. | Confusing latitude (horizontal) with longitude (vertical); Reading longitude values incorrectly (mixing east and west) |
| **Expected** | Using latitude and longitude to locate places precisely and explaining the significance of the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, Arctic and Antarctic Circles. | Confusing the Tropic of Cancer (north) with the Tropic of Capricorn (south); Not connecting latitude to climate patterns |
| **Greater Depth** | Explaining why the global grid system was developed, how it enables navigation, and why different map projections distort latitude and longitude differently. | Assuming flat maps are completely accurate representations of the Earth; Not understanding that all flat maps involve some kind of distortion |

### Secondary concept: Climate Zones and Biomes (GE-KS2-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Climate zones are large areas of the Earth characterised by similar patterns of temperature and rainfall, determined primarily by latitude. The main climate zones are tropical, subtropical, temperate, continental, polar and mountainous. Biomes are large ecological communities defined by their climate and vegetation: rainforest, savannah, desert, grassland, deciduous forest, coniferous forest, tundra and polar ice. At KS2, pupils develop understanding of how climate shapes the vegetation and wildlife of different regions, connecting physical and biological geography.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Naming at least three different climate zones or biomes and identifying one feature of each. | Confusing biomes with countries (e.g. 'Africa' instead of 'savannah'); Thinking all deserts are hot (cold deserts exist) |
| **Developing** | Describing the climate, vegetation and animal life of specific biomes and locating them on a world map. | Describing only one aspect (climate OR wildlife, not both); Not connecting the location of biomes to latitude and climate zones |
| **Expected** | Explaining why different biomes exist in different locations, connecting climate zones to latitude, and explaining how plants and animals are adapted. | Describing biomes without explaining why they occur where they do; Not connecting adaptations to the specific environmental conditions |
| **Greater Depth** | Evaluating human impact on biomes, explaining how deforestation, climate change or land use alters ecosystems, and considering sustainability. | Describing deforestation without explaining the wider consequences; Presenting the issue as one-sided without acknowledging why people clear forests |

### Secondary concept: Ordnance Survey Maps and Grid References (GE-KS2-C005)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Ordnance Survey (OS) maps are detailed topographic maps of Great Britain produced to standard conventions, using a national grid reference system, contour lines to represent relief, and a comprehensive set of conventional symbols. Four-figure grid references identify a 1km grid square; six-figure grid references identify a 100m square within that. The OS map is the primary tool for geographical fieldwork and navigation in the UK context, and the skills required to use it effectively - reading symbols, using grid references, interpreting contours - are core geographical competencies at KS2.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recognising common OS map symbols (church, post office, road, woodland) and understanding that the map represents a real place from above. | Guessing what symbols mean instead of checking the key; Not understanding that the map is a view from above |
| **Developing** | Using four-figure grid references to locate features on an OS map and reading common symbols from the key. | Reading northings before eastings (should be 'along the corridor and up the stairs'); Confusing the grid square with the grid lines |
| **Expected** | Using six-figure grid references to locate features precisely and interpreting contour lines to describe the relief of an area. | Estimating the third digit inaccurately in six-figure references; Confusing closely-spaced contour lines (steep) with widely-spaced ones (gentle) |
| **Greater Depth** | Using OS maps to plan routes, estimate distances, and explain how physical features influenced the location of human features. | Planning routes without considering contour lines and terrain; Not using the scale to estimate distance accurately |

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** Linking latitude bands to climate zones introduces the idea that global climate patterns are not random but follow predictable spatial regularities tied to distance from the equator and angle of incoming solar radiation.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- What pattern can you see?
- Does this always happen, or can you find an exception?
- What rule connects these examples?
- What would you predict for the next one? Why?

**Secondary lens:** Scale, Proportion and Quantity — Latitude and longitude are quantitative coordinate systems; the cognitive demand is understanding how degrees of arc translate to position on a sphere and why latitude predicts climate — reasoning about proportion and quantity in a spatial context.

## Session structure: Topic Study + Fieldwork

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Topic Study (main structure)
A structured enquiry into a defined topic, period, or place. Begins with an engaging hook to capture interest, builds contextual knowledge, moves through source analysis and interpretation, and culminates in a substantiated argument or conclusion. The core humanities template.

`hook` → `context` → `source_analysis` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Extended writing task presenting a reasoned argument supported by evidence from the topic. Can take the form of an essay, structured explanation, or debate position.

**Teacher note:** Use the TOPIC STUDY template: open with an engaging hook that raises a question or challenge. Build context using a timeline or key facts. Introduce 2-3 sources for pupils to analyse, prompting them to consider who made each source and why. Guide pupils toward forming their own interpretation, supported by evidence from the sources.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What does this source tell us, and what does it leave out?
- Who created this source, and why might that matter?
- Do these two sources agree or disagree? How can you tell?
- What is your interpretation, and what evidence supports it?

### Fieldwork
Learning through direct observation and data collection in the field (or simulated field environment). Includes preparation and planning, systematic data collection using fieldwork techniques, data processing and presentation, analysis of findings, and a conclusion that addresses the enquiry question.

`preparation` → `field_data_collection` → `processing` → `analysis` → `conclusion`

**Assessment:** Fieldwork report including methodology, data presentation using appropriate techniques (maps, graphs, tables, photographs), analysis of patterns, and conclusion with evaluation of data reliability.

**Teacher note:** Use the FIELDWORK template: prepare pupils for outdoor data collection with clear instructions and safety guidance. Guide them to use simple equipment such as clipboards, tally charts, thermometers, or maps. Help them organise their data back in the classroom and describe what they found. Encourage pupils to say what their fieldwork results tell them about the place or question.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What will we look for and record when we go outside?
- How will you keep your data organised?
- What did your fieldwork data tell you about this place?
- Was there anything that surprised you?

## Why this study matters

Rivers and the water cycle are a statutory KS2 physical geography requirement that connects observable local features (streams, rainfall, puddles evaporating) to global-scale processes (the hydrological cycle). Teaching through a specific river case study grounds abstract process understanding in real geographical contexts and enables pupils to trace how water shapes landscapes through erosion, transportation, and deposition.

## Sequencing

**Follows:** Hot and Cold Places: Seasonal and Daily Weather Patterns

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Teaching the water cycle as a closed diagram without connecting it to real rivers and rainfall pupils can observe
2. Presenting rivers as flowing in only one direction without explaining why (gravity and gradient)
3. Neglecting human interaction with rivers — flooding, water supply, settlement, and pollution

---

## Success criteria

**Pupils can:**
- Draw and label the water cycle with correct vocabulary
- Describe how a river changes from source to mouth
- Explain at least 2 river landforms (meander, flood plain, oxbow lake)
- Use a river basin map to identify source, mouth, and tributaries

## Geographical skills (KS2)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Using maps, atlases and globes** — Locating and identifying places in the United Kingdom and wider world using world maps, atlases and globes as reference tools, understanding that these are representations of the real world at reduced scale.
- **Using compass directions and locational language** — Applying the four cardinal compass directions (North, South, East, West) and everyday directional language such as near, far, left and right to describe the location of features and routes on maps and in the environment.
- **Using aerial photographs and making simple maps** — Interpreting aerial photographs and plan-perspective images to recognise landmarks and physical and human features, and translating these observations into a simple hand-drawn map with a basic symbol key.
- **Simple fieldwork and observational skills** — Going out into the school grounds and immediate surrounding environment to observe, describe and record human and physical geographical features at first hand, practising the habits of direct geographical enquiry.
- **Using maps, atlases, globes and digital mapping** — Extending atlas and map use to locate countries and describe the features studied across the curriculum, and beginning to use digital and computer mapping tools — including online satellite maps — to access geographical information in a range of formats.
- **Eight-point compass and Ordnance Survey map skills** — Applying the eight compass points, four-figure and six-figure grid references, and the symbols and conventions of Ordnance Survey maps to build knowledge of the UK and the wider world, and to navigate and locate features on topographic maps.
