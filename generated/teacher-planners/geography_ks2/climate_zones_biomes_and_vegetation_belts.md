## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Climate Zones and Biomes (GE-KS2-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Climate zones are large areas of the Earth characterised by similar patterns of temperature and rainfall, determined primarily by latitude. The main climate zones are tropical, subtropical, temperate, continental, polar and mountainous. Biomes are large ecological communities defined by their climate and vegetation: rainforest, savannah, desert, grassland, deciduous forest, coniferous forest, tundra and polar ice. At KS2, pupils develop understanding of how climate shapes the vegetation and wildlife of different regions, connecting physical and biological geography.

**Teaching guidance:** Use world climate and biome maps to show the distribution of different zones. Connect climate zones to latitude using the global grid: equatorial regions are typically tropical, polar regions are cold. Study specific biomes in depth: what are the characteristics, adaptations of plants and animals, human uses? Explore how climate change is altering biome boundaries. Compare a UK biome (temperate deciduous forest) with a contrasting global biome (tropical rainforest or desert). Connect to human geography by exploring how people adapt to different climate zones.

**Key vocabulary:** climate zone, biome, tropical, temperate, polar, arctic, desert, rainforest, savannah, tundra, vegetation belt, adaptation, precipitation, temperature, ecosystem

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may confuse climate zone with biome; clarifying that climate determines what biome can exist in an area resolves this. Pupils may think deserts are always hot; cold deserts (Gobi, Antarctica) challenge this assumption. The idea that tropical regions are always wet is also inaccurate; tropical wet and dry seasons should be distinguished. Pupils may underestimate how dramatically human activity has altered natural biomes; discussing deforestation and agriculture develops critical awareness.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Naming at least three different climate zones or biomes and identifying one feature of each. | Name three different environments (biomes) and describe one thing about each. | Confusing biomes with countries (e.g. 'Africa' instead of 'savannah'); Thinking all deserts are hot (cold deserts exist) |
| **Developing** | Describing the climate, vegetation and animal life of specific biomes and locating them on a world map. | Describe the tropical rainforest biome. Where in the world are rainforests found? | Describing only one aspect (climate OR wildlife, not both); Not connecting the location of biomes to latitude and climate zones |
| **Expected** | Explaining why different biomes exist in different locations, connecting climate zones to latitude, and explaining how plants and animals are adapted. | Why are tropical rainforests found near the Equator and not near the poles? How are rainforest plants adapted? | Describing biomes without explaining why they occur where they do; Not connecting adaptations to the specific environmental conditions |
| **Greater Depth** | Evaluating human impact on biomes, explaining how deforestation, climate change or land use alters ecosystems, and considering sustainability. | How is deforestation affecting the Amazon rainforest, and why should this matter to people in other countries? | Describing deforestation without explaining the wider consequences; Presenting the issue as one-sided without acknowledging why people clear forests |

> **Model response (Entry):** *Rainforest — very hot and wet with lots of trees. Desert — very dry with sandy or rocky ground. Arctic — very cold with ice and snow.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Tropical rainforests have hot temperatures all year round and very high rainfall. They have dense vegetation with tall trees forming a canopy. Animals include monkeys, parrots and insects. Rainforests are found near the Equator in South America, Africa and Southeast Asia.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Tropical rainforests need constant warmth and heavy rainfall, which occurs near the Equator because direct sunlight heats the air, causing evaporation and daily rain. Near the poles, sunlight is weaker so temperatures are too low. Rainforest trees grow tall to reach sunlight above the canopy, and some have drip-tip leaves to shed water quickly. Plants on the forest floor have huge leaves to capture what little light reaches them.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *Deforestation removes trees for cattle ranching and farming, destroying habitats and reducing biodiversity. Rainforests absorb carbon dioxide, so cutting them down increases greenhouse gases that affect the whole planet's climate. The Amazon also produces moisture that affects weather patterns far away. It matters to everyone because the rainforest provides global services — climate regulation, oxygen production and biodiversity — not just local ones.*

### Secondary concept: Latitude, Longitude and the Global Grid (GE-KS2-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Latitude and longitude are a coordinate system used to identify any location on Earth's surface. Lines of latitude run parallel to the Equator and measure distance north or south (0-90 degrees); lines of longitude run from Pole to Pole and measure distance east or west of the Prime Meridian (0-180 degrees). Special lines of latitude - the Equator, Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, and the Arctic and Antarctic Circles - mark significant climatic boundaries. The Prime Meridian (0 degrees longitude) divides the Eastern and Western Hemispheres and is the reference for time zones. At KS2, pupils learn to use this system to locate and describe global position.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying the Equator, North Pole and South Pole on a globe and understanding that latitude lines run horizontally. | Confusing the Equator with the Prime Meridian; Thinking the Equator only passes through Africa |
| **Developing** | Identifying lines of latitude and longitude on a map and using them to describe approximate locations of countries and features. | Confusing latitude (horizontal) with longitude (vertical); Reading longitude values incorrectly (mixing east and west) |
| **Expected** | Using latitude and longitude to locate places precisely and explaining the significance of the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, Arctic and Antarctic Circles. | Confusing the Tropic of Cancer (north) with the Tropic of Capricorn (south); Not connecting latitude to climate patterns |
| **Greater Depth** | Explaining why the global grid system was developed, how it enables navigation, and why different map projections distort latitude and longitude differently. | Assuming flat maps are completely accurate representations of the Earth; Not understanding that all flat maps involve some kind of distortion |

### Secondary concept: Ordnance Survey Maps and Grid References (GE-KS2-C005)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Ordnance Survey (OS) maps are detailed topographic maps of Great Britain produced to standard conventions, using a national grid reference system, contour lines to represent relief, and a comprehensive set of conventional symbols. Four-figure grid references identify a 1km grid square; six-figure grid references identify a 100m square within that. The OS map is the primary tool for geographical fieldwork and navigation in the UK context, and the skills required to use it effectively - reading symbols, using grid references, interpreting contours - are core geographical competencies at KS2.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recognising common OS map symbols (church, post office, road, woodland) and understanding that the map represents a real place from above. | Guessing what symbols mean instead of checking the key; Not understanding that the map is a view from above |
| **Developing** | Using four-figure grid references to locate features on an OS map and reading common symbols from the key. | Reading northings before eastings (should be 'along the corridor and up the stairs'); Confusing the grid square with the grid lines |
| **Expected** | Using six-figure grid references to locate features precisely and interpreting contour lines to describe the relief of an area. | Estimating the third digit inaccurately in six-figure references; Confusing closely-spaced contour lines (steep) with widely-spaced ones (gentle) |
| **Greater Depth** | Using OS maps to plan routes, estimate distances, and explain how physical features influenced the location of human features. | Planning routes without considering contour lines and terrain; Not using the scale to estimate distance accurately |

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** Linking latitude bands to climate zones introduces the idea that global climate patterns are not random but follow predictable spatial regularities tied to distance from the equator and angle of incoming solar radiation.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- What pattern can you see?
- Does this always happen, or can you find an exception?
- What rule connects these examples?
- What would you predict for the next one? Why?

**Secondary lens:** Scale, Proportion and Quantity — Latitude and longitude are quantitative coordinate systems; the cognitive demand is understanding how degrees of arc translate to position on a sphere and why latitude predicts climate — reasoning about proportion and quantity in a spatial context.

## Session structure: Topic Study

### Topic Study
A structured enquiry into a defined topic, period, or place. Begins with an engaging hook to capture interest, builds contextual knowledge, moves through source analysis and interpretation, and culminates in a substantiated argument or conclusion. The core humanities template.

`hook` → `context` → `source_analysis` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Extended writing task presenting a reasoned argument supported by evidence from the topic. Can take the form of an essay, structured explanation, or debate position.

**Teacher note:** Use the TOPIC STUDY template: open with an engaging hook that raises a question or challenge. Build context using a timeline or key facts. Introduce 2-3 sources for pupils to analyse, prompting them to consider who made each source and why. Guide pupils toward forming their own interpretation, supported by evidence from the sources.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What does this source tell us, and what does it leave out?
- Who created this source, and why might that matter?
- Do these two sources agree or disagree? How can you tell?
- What is your interpretation, and what evidence supports it?

## Why this study matters

Climate zones and biomes are a statutory KS2 requirement that builds directly on KS1 work on hot and cold places, extending it into a systematic understanding of how latitude, altitude, and ocean currents determine the world's major climate patterns and the ecosystems they support. This topic connects physical geography (climate) to biological geography (biomes) and prepares pupils for KS3 work on climate change.

## Sequencing

**Follows:** Hot and Cold Places: Seasonal and Daily Weather Patterns

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Teaching biomes as a list to memorise rather than connecting each to its climate determinants (latitude, rainfall, temperature)
2. Confusing climate zones with biomes — climate determines what biome can exist, but they are not the same thing
3. Presenting biomes as untouched wilderness without acknowledging massive human modification (deforestation, agriculture)

---

## Success criteria

**Pupils can:**
- Name and locate at least 4 major climate zones on a world map
- Describe the characteristics of at least 3 biomes (climate, vegetation, wildlife)
- Explain how latitude and rainfall determine which biome exists in an area
- Read and interpret a simple climate graph

## Geographical skills (KS2)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Using maps, atlases and globes** — Locating and identifying places in the United Kingdom and wider world using world maps, atlases and globes as reference tools, understanding that these are representations of the real world at reduced scale.
- **Using compass directions and locational language** — Applying the four cardinal compass directions (North, South, East, West) and everyday directional language such as near, far, left and right to describe the location of features and routes on maps and in the environment.
- **Using aerial photographs and making simple maps** — Interpreting aerial photographs and plan-perspective images to recognise landmarks and physical and human features, and translating these observations into a simple hand-drawn map with a basic symbol key.
- **Simple fieldwork and observational skills** — Going out into the school grounds and immediate surrounding environment to observe, describe and record human and physical geographical features at first hand, practising the habits of direct geographical enquiry.
- **Using maps, atlases, globes and digital mapping** — Extending atlas and map use to locate countries and describe the features studied across the curriculum, and beginning to use digital and computer mapping tools — including online satellite maps — to access geographical information in a range of formats.
- **Eight-point compass and Ordnance Survey map skills** — Applying the eight compass points, four-figure and six-figure grid references, and the symbols and conventions of Ordnance Survey maps to build knowledge of the UK and the wider world, and to navigate and locate features on topographic maps.
