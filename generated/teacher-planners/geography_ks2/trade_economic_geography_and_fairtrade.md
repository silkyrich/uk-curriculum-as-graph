## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Settlement and Economic Geography (GE-KS2-C004)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Settlements are places where people live and work, ranging from small hamlets to megacities. Their location, growth and character are shaped by physical factors (water supply, defensibility, flat land, resources) and human factors (trade routes, industry, government decisions). Economic activity is classified into sectors: primary (extracting raw materials), secondary (manufacturing), tertiary (services) and quaternary (knowledge-based). The distribution of natural resources including food, minerals, energy and water shapes economic activity and trade between places at global scales. At KS2, pupils develop conceptual frameworks for understanding why places are where they are and how economies work.

**Teaching guidance:** Study local settlement history: why was the town/city located here? What factors drove its growth? Compare settlement patterns in different environments: how do desert settlements differ from coastal or riverside ones? Use examples of global trade to illustrate economic interdependence. Investigate the origin of food and goods in the classroom or school. Map the distribution of specific natural resources (oil, minerals, food production) and connect to trade patterns. Explore how economic activity changes over time in a specific area.

**Key vocabulary:** settlement, hamlet, village, town, city, conurbation, urbanisation, primary sector, secondary sector, tertiary sector, trade, import, export, natural resource, energy, mineral, distribution

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may think cities grow randomly rather than for geographical reasons. Studying the historical reasons for settlement location challenges this. The concept of comparative advantage in trade can be difficult; concrete examples of why one place might specialise in particular goods make it accessible. Pupils may not appreciate the scale of global economic interdependence; tracking the journey of a familiar product from raw material to consumer makes global connections tangible.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying different types of settlement (village, town, city) and naming one reason why people live in settlements. | What is the difference between a village and a city? Why do people live together in settlements? | Not understanding that settlement size exists on a spectrum; Thinking all settlements were always the size they are now |
| **Developing** | Describing why settlements are located where they are, identifying physical and human factors that influence settlement location. | Why were many old towns built near rivers? Give at least two reasons. | Giving only one reason when multiple factors influenced settlement location; Not distinguishing between physical factors (water, flat land) and human factors (trade routes) |
| **Expected** | Explaining how economic activities are connected across places through trade, describing primary, secondary and tertiary sectors. | Explain the journey of a chocolate bar from the cocoa farm to the shop, identifying the different types of economic activity involved. | Confusing primary, secondary and tertiary economic activities; Not recognising that trade connects distant places in a single supply chain |
| **Greater Depth** | Evaluating how globalisation and economic change affect settlements, including the impact of deindustrialisation, migration and trade on communities. | Many factory towns in the UK have changed since their factories closed. What happened and how have these places adapted? | Presenting economic change as having only negative effects; Not connecting local changes to wider national or global economic trends |

> **Model response (Entry):** *A village is small with few buildings and a city is very large with lots of buildings and people. People live in settlements because they need to be near other people, shops and schools.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Towns were built near rivers because rivers provided drinking water and water for animals. Rivers were used for transport — boats could carry heavy goods. The flat land near rivers was good for building on and farming. Some rivers were also good for defence — a river on one side made the town harder to attack.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Cocoa beans are grown on a farm in Ghana — that is a primary activity (extracting raw materials). The beans are shipped to a factory in the UK where they are processed into chocolate — that is a secondary activity (manufacturing). The chocolate bar is then transported to shops and sold to customers — that is a tertiary activity (providing a service). Each stage happens in a different place and involves different workers.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *When factories closed, people lost jobs and the towns became poorer. Young people often moved away to find work elsewhere. Some towns have adapted by developing tourism, technology industries or universities. Others have struggled with unemployment and depopulation. This shows that the economy of a place can change dramatically, and that places need to adapt when their main industry disappears.*

### Secondary concept: Latitude, Longitude and the Global Grid (GE-KS2-C001)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Latitude and longitude are a coordinate system used to identify any location on Earth's surface. Lines of latitude run parallel to the Equator and measure distance north or south (0-90 degrees); lines of longitude run from Pole to Pole and measure distance east or west of the Prime Meridian (0-180 degrees). Special lines of latitude - the Equator, Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, and the Arctic and Antarctic Circles - mark significant climatic boundaries. The Prime Meridian (0 degrees longitude) divides the Eastern and Western Hemispheres and is the reference for time zones. At KS2, pupils learn to use this system to locate and describe global position.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying the Equator, North Pole and South Pole on a globe and understanding that latitude lines run horizontally. | Confusing the Equator with the Prime Meridian; Thinking the Equator only passes through Africa |
| **Developing** | Identifying lines of latitude and longitude on a map and using them to describe approximate locations of countries and features. | Confusing latitude (horizontal) with longitude (vertical); Reading longitude values incorrectly (mixing east and west) |
| **Expected** | Using latitude and longitude to locate places precisely and explaining the significance of the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, Arctic and Antarctic Circles. | Confusing the Tropic of Cancer (north) with the Tropic of Capricorn (south); Not connecting latitude to climate patterns |
| **Greater Depth** | Explaining why the global grid system was developed, how it enables navigation, and why different map projections distort latitude and longitude differently. | Assuming flat maps are completely accurate representations of the Earth; Not understanding that all flat maps involve some kind of distortion |

### Secondary concept: Climate Zones and Biomes (GE-KS2-C002)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Climate zones are large areas of the Earth characterised by similar patterns of temperature and rainfall, determined primarily by latitude. The main climate zones are tropical, subtropical, temperate, continental, polar and mountainous. Biomes are large ecological communities defined by their climate and vegetation: rainforest, savannah, desert, grassland, deciduous forest, coniferous forest, tundra and polar ice. At KS2, pupils develop understanding of how climate shapes the vegetation and wildlife of different regions, connecting physical and biological geography.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Naming at least three different climate zones or biomes and identifying one feature of each. | Confusing biomes with countries (e.g. 'Africa' instead of 'savannah'); Thinking all deserts are hot (cold deserts exist) |
| **Developing** | Describing the climate, vegetation and animal life of specific biomes and locating them on a world map. | Describing only one aspect (climate OR wildlife, not both); Not connecting the location of biomes to latitude and climate zones |
| **Expected** | Explaining why different biomes exist in different locations, connecting climate zones to latitude, and explaining how plants and animals are adapted. | Describing biomes without explaining why they occur where they do; Not connecting adaptations to the specific environmental conditions |
| **Greater Depth** | Evaluating human impact on biomes, explaining how deforestation, climate change or land use alters ecosystems, and considering sustainability. | Describing deforestation without explaining the wider consequences; Presenting the issue as one-sided without acknowledging why people clear forests |

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** Linking latitude bands to climate zones introduces the idea that global climate patterns are not random but follow predictable spatial regularities tied to distance from the equator and angle of incoming solar radiation.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- What pattern can you see?
- Does this always happen, or can you find an exception?
- What rule connects these examples?
- What would you predict for the next one? Why?

**Secondary lens:** Scale, Proportion and Quantity — Latitude and longitude are quantitative coordinate systems; the cognitive demand is understanding how degrees of arc translate to position on a sphere and why latitude predicts climate — reasoning about proportion and quantity in a spatial context.

## Session structure: Topic Study

### Topic Study
A structured enquiry into a defined topic, period, or place. Begins with an engaging hook to capture interest, builds contextual knowledge, moves through source analysis and interpretation, and culminates in a substantiated argument or conclusion. The core humanities template.

`hook` → `context` → `source_analysis` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Extended writing task presenting a reasoned argument supported by evidence from the topic. Can take the form of an essay, structured explanation, or debate position.

**Teacher note:** Use the TOPIC STUDY template: open with an engaging hook that raises a question or challenge. Build context using a timeline or key facts. Introduce 2-3 sources for pupils to analyse, prompting them to consider who made each source and why. Guide pupils toward forming their own interpretation, supported by evidence from the sources.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What does this source tell us, and what does it leave out?
- Who created this source, and why might that matter?
- Do these two sources agree or disagree? How can you tell?
- What is your interpretation, and what evidence supports it?

## Study scope

**Scale:** Global
**Themes:** global trade, economic sectors, natural resources, fair trade, supply chains

**Map types:** thematic map, trade flow map, resource distribution map, atlas map
**Data sources:** Fairtrade Foundation, World Bank, ONS trade statistics, Product packaging (origin labels)

**Fieldwork potential:** Classroom-based investigation tracing the origins of products in the school kitchen or shop; local supermarket survey mapping the countries of origin for a basket of goods.

**Assessment guidance:** Can pupils trace a product from primary producer to consumer? Can they explain the three economic sectors? Can they map where specific natural resources come from? Can they evaluate Fairtrade as a response to trade inequality?

## Locations

### Global (Global, global, global)
**Development context:** not_applicable
**Key physical features:** Equator, Poles, continents, oceans, climate zones
**Key human features:** 200+ countries, 8 billion people, global trade networks


---

## Why this study matters

Fairtrade is the most common pedagogical vehicle schools use to deliver the KS2 statutory requirement on trade and economic activity, because it makes abstract global supply chains concrete and age-accessible. Tracing products (chocolate, bananas, cotton) from producer to consumer introduces pupils to primary, secondary, and tertiary economic sectors, global trade patterns, and the distribution of natural resources.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Presenting Fairtrade as the only or complete solution to trade inequality — it is one model with both strengths and limitations
2. Oversimplifying producer countries as uniformly poor without showing their economic complexity
3. Focusing only on the product journey without connecting to the broader statutory requirement on settlement, land use, and resources

## Sensitive content

- Global inequality — avoid deficit framing of producer countries; show economic agency and complexity

---

## Success criteria

**Pupils can:**
- Trace a specific product through its supply chain from producer to consumer
- Explain the difference between primary, secondary, and tertiary economic sectors
- Map the origins of at least 3 natural resources on a world map
- Give at least 1 argument for and 1 argument against Fairtrade

## Geographical skills (KS2)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Using maps, atlases and globes** — Locating and identifying places in the United Kingdom and wider world using world maps, atlases and globes as reference tools, understanding that these are representations of the real world at reduced scale.
- **Using compass directions and locational language** — Applying the four cardinal compass directions (North, South, East, West) and everyday directional language such as near, far, left and right to describe the location of features and routes on maps and in the environment.
- **Using aerial photographs and making simple maps** — Interpreting aerial photographs and plan-perspective images to recognise landmarks and physical and human features, and translating these observations into a simple hand-drawn map with a basic symbol key.
- **Simple fieldwork and observational skills** — Going out into the school grounds and immediate surrounding environment to observe, describe and record human and physical geographical features at first hand, practising the habits of direct geographical enquiry.
- **Using maps, atlases, globes and digital mapping** — Extending atlas and map use to locate countries and describe the features studied across the curriculum, and beginning to use digital and computer mapping tools — including online satellite maps — to access geographical information in a range of formats.
- **Eight-point compass and Ordnance Survey map skills** — Applying the eight compass points, four-figure and six-figure grid references, and the symbols and conventions of Ordnance Survey maps to build knowledge of the UK and the wider world, and to navigate and locate features on topographic maps.
