## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Electrical Systems and Series Circuits (DT-KS2-C004)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Electrical systems use the flow of electrical current through components to produce light, sound, heat or movement. At KS2, pupils learn to design and build series circuits incorporating switches, bulbs, buzzers and motors, understanding how these can be used to add active functionality to a designed product. This concept bridges design and technology with science, as understanding of circuits is developed in both subjects.

**Teaching guidance:** Connect to science circuits work by applying electrical knowledge in DT contexts. Build working series circuits as part of product designs - a lit-up toy, a burglar alarm, a motorised vehicle. Teach pupils to represent circuits using standard circuit symbols and to plan their circuits before building. Investigate the effect of adding more bulbs in series. Discuss how electrical components are incorporated in real products and what safety considerations apply.

**Key vocabulary:** circuit, series, component, switch, bulb, buzzer, motor, battery, current, conductor, insulator, symbol, diagram

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may not understand that all components in a series circuit must be connected for current to flow, leading to confusion when a broken circuit does not work. Physical construction of circuits reinforces this concept better than diagrams alone. Pupils may confuse the functions of different output components (bulb gives light, buzzer gives sound, motor gives movement).

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Building a simple working series circuit with a battery, switch and one output component (bulb or buzzer). | Connect a battery, switch and bulb so the bulb lights up when the switch is on. | Leaving a gap in the circuit so current cannot flow; Not understanding that the switch must be closed for the circuit to work |
| **Developing** | Incorporating a working circuit into a designed product and using a circuit diagram with standard symbols to plan it. | Design a lighthouse model with a light that can be switched on and off. Draw the circuit diagram first. | Not using standard circuit symbols in the diagram; Placing the LED the wrong way round (LEDs only work in one direction) |
| **Expected** | Designing and building a product with a more complex circuit incorporating multiple components, and troubleshooting when the circuit doesn't work. | Build a model alarm system with a buzzer that sounds when a door opens, and an LED that shows the system is armed. | Not being able to diagnose why a circuit isn't working (checking connections systematically); Designing a circuit that is too complex to debug |

> **Model response (Entry):** *I connected a wire from the battery to the switch, then from the switch to the bulb, then from the bulb back to the battery. When I close the switch, the bulb lights up.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *My circuit has a battery, a switch and an LED. I drew the diagram using the standard symbols. The LED goes in the top of the lighthouse model and the switch is on the outside so you can turn the light on and off. The battery is hidden inside the base.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *I used a switch as the 'door sensor' — when the door opens, the switch closes and the buzzer sounds. A separate switch keeps the LED on to show the system is active. When I tested it, the buzzer didn't work — I traced the circuit and found a loose wire at the battery terminal. After fixing it, both the LED and buzzer work correctly.*

### Secondary concept: Research-Informed Design (DT-KS2-C001)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

At KS2, effective design is grounded in research that identifies the needs, preferences and constraints relevant to a product. Research may involve interviewing potential users, examining existing products, investigating materials, or exploring relevant contexts. The findings from research are used to develop design criteria that shape the design process and provide the basis for evaluation.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Carrying out basic research before designing: examining an existing product or asking a simple question about user needs. | Looking at products without making observations about design features; Starting to design without doing any research |
| **Developing** | Conducting structured research (user interviews, product analysis, or contextual investigation) and using findings to create design criteria. | Writing criteria based on own preferences rather than research findings; Conducting research but not connecting it to the design brief |
| **Expected** | Using multiple research methods to inform a design, translating findings into specific, measurable design criteria, and justifying design choices with evidence. | Designing a solution that doesn't address the actual user needs identified in research; Not being able to trace design decisions back to specific research findings |

### Secondary concept: Accurate Making and Material Processing (DT-KS2-C006)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Accurate making refers to the ability to execute practical tasks — measuring, marking out, cutting, shaping, joining and finishing — with precision so that a product matches the design intention and meets functional requirements. At KS2, pupils develop accuracy as a deliberate goal, understanding that imprecise making produces products that do not work correctly or are of poor quality. Material processing knowledge — understanding how different materials respond to cutting, bending, folding, sewing or mixing — enables pupils to select and apply the most effective technique for the material and task at hand.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Measuring and cutting materials to a marked line with reasonable accuracy using basic tools. | Not measuring from the zero mark on the ruler; Cutting without marking first, leading to inaccurate lengths |
| **Developing** | Measuring, marking out and cutting with accuracy across different materials, understanding that accuracy in early stages prevents problems later. | Measuring only one piece carefully and estimating the others; Cutting on the line rather than just outside it, losing material and ending up too short |
| **Expected** | Working with precision across the full making process, selecting appropriate tools and techniques for each material, and explaining how accuracy affects the quality of the finished product. | Not planning for tolerance — making the lid exactly the same size as the box so it doesn't fit; Using imprecise tools (scissors instead of a craft knife) for work that requires straight edges |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Selecting functional and aesthetic material properties for a specific application requires pupils to match material characteristics to the structural and functional demands of the product — a direct structure-function reasoning task.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- How does the shape or arrangement help it do its job?
- Can you find two different structures that do the same thing? How do they compare?
- If you were designing this, what would you keep and what would you change?
- Why is this material or structure better suited than another?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Research-informed design requires pupils to use evidence gathered about user needs and existing products to justify their design criteria — each design decision becomes a claim that must be supported by research evidence.

## Session structure: Design, Make, Evaluate

### Design, Make, Evaluate
The core Design & Technology cycle. Pupils investigate existing products and user needs, design a solution with clear specifications, plan the making process, construct using appropriate materials and techniques, test against the design brief, and evaluate the outcome with suggestions for improvement.

`investigate` → `design` → `plan` → `make` → `test` → `evaluate`

**Assessment:** Design portfolio including investigation findings, annotated design with specifications, making log, test results, and evaluative conclusion comparing outcome to original brief.

**Teacher note:** Use the DESIGN, MAKE AND EVALUATE template: investigate existing products to understand how they meet a need. Guide pupils to create a design specification, produce labelled designs, plan the order of making, and use tools and materials with increasing accuracy. Include testing against the original specification and a structured evaluation of the finished product.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What is the design specification, and how does your design meet it?
- What tools and techniques will you use, and why?
- How accurately have you followed your design?
- How well does your product meet the specification? What improvements would you make?

## Design and Technology: Electrical Systems

**Design brief:** Design and make a working torch for use in a specific situation (e.g. camping, reading under the covers, emergency). The torch must have a switch to turn it on and off.

**Materials:** card tubes, aluminium foil, wire, batteries (AA), LED bulbs, paper clips, tape, plastic bottles
**Tools:** scissors, wire strippers (adult use), tape, ruler
**Techniques:** circuit building, switch making, housing construction, reflector design, wire connecting
**Safety notes:** Never use mains electricity. Use batteries only (max 4.5V). Wire strippers: adult use only. Check for short circuits before testing. LED bulbs preferred over filament bulbs (no heat risk). Ensure battery compartment allows easy battery replacement.

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Does the torch produce light?
- Does the switch work reliably?
- Is the torch suitable for its intended purpose?
- Is the torch comfortable to hold?

## Why this study matters

A torch is a real, functional product that pupils can test immediately -- does it light up? This creates an unambiguous success criterion. The project requires understanding of simple circuits (Science cross-curricular), switch design (mechanism), and housing construction (structures). It naturally integrates three DT strands in one project.

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Loose connections -- use crocodile clips for testing before taping permanently
2. Battery orientation wrong -- teach polarity before construction
3. Housing blocks light -- ensure reflector design considered early
4. Short circuits from exposed wire -- insulate all connections
