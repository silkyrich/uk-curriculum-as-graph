## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Computing Control in Products (DT-KS2-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Computing can be applied to design and technology to create products that sense inputs, process information and control outputs. At KS2, pupils apply their understanding of programming to program, monitor and control their products, using components such as sensors, microcontrollers and actuators. This concept introduces the idea that modern products often contain embedded software that makes them intelligent and responsive.

**Teaching guidance:** Use programmable microcontrollers such as micro:bit, Arduino or similar platforms suited to primary pupils. Set projects where pupils program a device to respond to sensor input - lighting an LED when it gets dark, making a motor stop when a button is pressed. Connect programming tasks to the DT design process - pupils should design what their product will do, then program it to achieve that function. Evaluate how well the program meets the design criteria.

**Key vocabulary:** program, control, sensor, actuator, microcontroller, input, output, condition, sequence, monitor, automate, code

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may see computing control as separate from DT rather than as an integrated part of product design. Framing programming tasks as part of the design-make-evaluate cycle maintains this connection. Some pupils may struggle with the abstraction of programming; physical computing with immediate, visible outputs (LEDs, motors) helps make the logic concrete.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Using a simple program to control one output (e.g. turning an LED on and off using a micro:bit or similar device). | Write a program that makes an LED blink on and off every second. | Forgetting to put the instructions in a loop so the LED only blinks once; Not including a wait command so the blink is too fast to see |
| **Developing** | Programming a device to respond to a sensor input by controlling an output, integrating this into a DT product. | Program a night light that turns on automatically when the room gets dark, using the micro:bit's light sensor. | Not setting an appropriate threshold value for the sensor; Testing the program without integrating it into the product design |
| **Expected** | Designing a product that uses computing control purposefully, programming multiple inputs and outputs, and evaluating the program as part of the product evaluation. | Design and program a smart plant watering reminder that uses a moisture sensor and displays a message when the plant needs water. | Treating the programming as a separate computing task rather than part of the DT project; Not testing and refining the threshold values for real-world conditions |

> **Model response (Entry):** *I used three blocks: 'turn LED on', 'wait 1 second', 'turn LED off', 'wait 1 second', all inside a 'forever' loop.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *I read the light level from the sensor. If the level is below 50, I turn the LED on. If it is above 50, I turn it off. I put this in a forever loop so it keeps checking. I built a card housing for the micro:bit so it looks like a bedside lamp.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *My program reads the moisture sensor every 10 minutes. If the reading is below 30, it displays 'Water me!' on the LED matrix and plays a sound. If the level is fine, it shows a happy face. I tested with dry and wet soil. In my evaluation, I noted the threshold needed adjusting — 30 was too low for some plants. The program is part of the product design, not separate from it.*

### Secondary concept: Advanced Mechanical Systems (DT-KS2-C003)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Mechanical systems use physical components to transmit, redirect or transform motion and force. At KS2, pupils extend their KS1 knowledge of levers, sliders and wheels to include gears, pulleys, cams and linkages, understanding how these more complex mechanisms change the speed, direction and type of movement in a product. Pupils apply this knowledge by incorporating appropriate mechanisms into their own designed products.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying gears, pulleys and cams in existing products or construction kits and describing what movement they create. | Not noticing that meshed gears turn in opposite directions; Thinking both gears turn at the same speed |
| **Developing** | Explaining how gears, pulleys or cams change the speed, direction or type of movement, and incorporating a simple mechanism into a product. | Using a round cam and wondering why the follower doesn't move up and down; Not securing the cam to the axle so it slips instead of turning |
| **Expected** | Selecting and combining mechanical systems to achieve a specific movement in a designed product, explaining the mechanical advantage and how components interact. | Choosing gears without considering the ratio and its effect on speed; Not being able to explain why the mechanism produces the desired movement |

### Secondary concept: Electrical Systems and Series Circuits (DT-KS2-C004)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Electrical systems use the flow of electrical current through components to produce light, sound, heat or movement. At KS2, pupils learn to design and build series circuits incorporating switches, bulbs, buzzers and motors, understanding how these can be used to add active functionality to a designed product. This concept bridges design and technology with science, as understanding of circuits is developed in both subjects.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Building a simple working series circuit with a battery, switch and one output component (bulb or buzzer). | Leaving a gap in the circuit so current cannot flow; Not understanding that the switch must be closed for the circuit to work |
| **Developing** | Incorporating a working circuit into a designed product and using a circuit diagram with standard symbols to plan it. | Not using standard circuit symbols in the diagram; Placing the LED the wrong way round (LEDs only work in one direction) |
| **Expected** | Designing and building a product with a more complex circuit incorporating multiple components, and troubleshooting when the circuit doesn't work. | Not being able to diagnose why a circuit isn't working (checking connections systematically); Designing a circuit that is too complex to debug |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Advanced mechanical systems (gears, pulleys, cams) are studied precisely to understand how their structural arrangement — gear ratios, cam profile, pulley configuration — determines the motion output they produce.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- How does the shape or arrangement help it do its job?
- Can you find two different structures that do the same thing? How do they compare?
- If you were designing this, what would you keep and what would you change?
- Why is this material or structure better suited than another?

**Secondary lens:** Systems and System Models — Electrical and computer-controlled systems are multi-component systems where input sensors, a controller, and output actuators interact — pupils must model the system as a whole to design a product where all components work together.

## Session structure: Practical Application

### Practical Application
A hands-on sequence where pupils apply knowledge and skills to solve a practical problem or create a functional outcome. Begins with a real-world context, builds skills through rehearsal, guides design or planning, supports making or problem-solving, and concludes with evaluation against success criteria.

`context` → `skill_rehearsal` → `design` → `make_or_solve` → `evaluate`

**Assessment:** Practical outcome (solution, product, program) evaluated against defined success criteria, with written or verbal explanation of the process and decisions made.

**Teacher note:** Use the PRACTICAL APPLICATION template: set a real-world context or problem that requires pupils to apply knowledge and skills. Rehearse the key skills needed through guided practice. Support pupils in designing their approach, carrying out the practical task, and evaluating their outcome. Encourage them to explain what worked well and what they would improve.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What skills will you need to solve this problem?
- What is your plan, and why did you choose this approach?
- How well did your solution work?
- What would you change if you did it again?

## Design and Technology: Electrical Systems

**Design brief:** Design and build a motorised buggy that can be programmed to navigate a simple obstacle course. The buggy must move forward, turn, and stop using programmed instructions.

**Materials:** card and MDF for chassis, DC motors (2x), wheels, battery pack, micro:bit or similar, motor driver board, wire, tape
**Tools:** scissors, glue gun (adult use), wire strippers (adult use), computer for programming
**Techniques:** chassis construction, motor mounting, circuit building, programming sequences, testing and debugging
**Safety notes:** Battery-powered only (max 4.5V). Wire strippers and glue gun: adult use only. Ensure motor connections are secure before testing. Test on floor, not on tables. Micro:bit should be handled carefully to avoid static damage. Supervise all soldering (if applicable) -- well-ventilated area, safety glasses.

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Does the buggy move forward in a straight line?
- Can it turn?
- Can it navigate the obstacle course?
- Is the program efficient (no unnecessary steps)?

## Why this study matters

A programmable buggy combines electrical systems, mechanisms (wheels), structures (chassis), and computing control in a single project. Using a micro:bit or similar microcontroller, pupils program the buggy to navigate a course. This is the most complex KS2 DT project and represents the culmination of four years of technical learning.

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Motors too powerful for the chassis -- match motor speed to structural strength
2. Code does not account for motor differences -- two identical motors may run at slightly different speeds
3. Not testing incrementally -- program one movement at a time, not the whole course

| Example correct feedback | *You recognised that 1/2 is larger than 2/5, and used the common denominator method correctly. The visualiser confirms it — the bar for 1/2 is noticeably longer.* |
| Example error feedback | *The reasoning does not quite hold: you said both fractions are the same because the numerator in 2/5 is double the numerator in 1/2. But the denominator changed too — the pieces got smaller. Converting to tenths: 1/2 = 5/10 and 2/5 = 4/10. Which is larger now?* |
