## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Technical Drawing and Design Communication (DT-KS2-C002)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Technical drawing involves representing design ideas using conventions that communicate information about how a product looks, how it is constructed and how its parts relate to each other. At KS2, pupils learn to use annotated sketches, cross-sectional diagrams, exploded diagrams, pattern pieces and computer-aided design to communicate their ideas clearly and accurately to others who will make or evaluate the product.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach specific drawing conventions including labelling, dimensioning and cross-sections. Practice exploded diagrams to show how components fit together. Introduce appropriate computer-aided design tools for generating and presenting design ideas. Discuss why designers need to communicate their ideas clearly to others, such as when a design is made by someone other than the designer. Compare technical drawings with artistic drawings to highlight different purposes.

**Key vocabulary:** annotated sketch, cross-section, exploded diagram, prototype, pattern piece, computer-aided design, dimension, label, scale, proportion

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may treat all drawing in DT as artistic expression rather than technical communication. Establishing that technical drawing has specific conventions and purposes helps. Some pupils may find exploded and cross-sectional diagrams conceptually challenging; building up from physical disassembly of real objects helps develop the mental model.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Drawing a labelled sketch of a design idea showing the main features and materials. | Draw your design for a phone stand. Label the parts and what materials you will use. | Drawing without any labels or annotations; Drawing an artistic picture rather than a design that could be made |
| **Developing** | Using annotated sketches with dimensions, and creating at least one alternative design to compare options. | Draw two different designs for the phone stand. Add measurements and explain which you would choose and why. | Not including dimensions so the design cannot be accurately made; Not comparing the designs against criteria — just choosing a favourite |
| **Expected** | Communicating designs using annotated sketches, cross-sections or exploded diagrams, with dimensions and construction notes sufficient for someone else to follow. | Create a design drawing for your project that another pupil could use to make the product without asking you questions. | Drawing only one view when multiple views are needed to understand the design; Not including enough detail for someone else to build from the drawing |

> **Model response (Entry):** *I drew a phone stand with a back support and a front lip. Labels: 'back support — card', 'base — wood', 'front lip — card strip to stop phone sliding'.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Design A is a simple angled back rest, 12cm tall and 8cm wide. Design B is a box shape with a slot. I chose Design A because it uses less material and is easier to make, but Design B would be more stable. I'll add a wider base to Design A to fix the stability problem.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *I drew a front view and a side cross-section showing how the layers fit together. I included all measurements in cm, listed materials for each part, numbered the assembly steps, and drew an exploded diagram showing how the three pieces slot together. I also noted where I would use glue and where I would use screws.*

### Secondary concept: Functional and Aesthetic Material Properties (DT-KS2-C007)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Materials have both functional properties — characteristics that determine how they perform in use, such as strength, flexibility, conductivity and waterproofness — and aesthetic properties — characteristics that determine how they appear and feel, such as colour, texture, pattern, translucency and surface quality. At KS2, pupils learn to consider both dimensions when selecting materials for a design task, understanding that a material must be both functionally suitable and appropriately appealing for the product to succeed. This concept extends KS1 material knowledge by making the functional/aesthetic distinction explicit.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying simple material properties (strong, flexible, waterproof, soft) and choosing a material for a stated purpose. | Choosing based on colour or familiarity rather than functional properties; Not being able to name the relevant property that makes the material suitable |
| **Developing** | Considering both functional and aesthetic properties when selecting materials, and explaining the trade-offs between them. | Considering only function or only aesthetics, not both; Not recognising that combining materials can solve trade-off problems |
| **Expected** | Analysing materials systematically against multiple criteria and making justified selections, considering functional performance, aesthetic quality and fitness for purpose. | Choosing a material without comparing alternatives; Not using criteria systematically — just going with initial instinct |

### Secondary concept: Product Investigation and Analysis (DT-KS2-C008)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Product investigation involves systematically examining existing products to understand their purpose, intended users, materials, construction methods, mechanisms, aesthetics and how successfully they fulfil their design intent. At KS2, investigation is more structured and analytical than at KS1: pupils use frameworks to compare products, consider both strengths and limitations, and relate findings to their own design work. Understanding how existing products solve design problems is a valuable source of design inspiration and technical knowledge.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Examining a product and describing its purpose, materials and one feature of how it works. | Describing only the outside appearance without thinking about how it works; Not identifying the purpose beyond the obvious |
| **Developing** | Analysing a product using a structured framework: purpose, user, materials, construction, mechanisms and fitness for purpose. | Skipping parts of the analytical framework; Describing without analysing — saying what it is but not how well it performs |
| **Expected** | Comparing products systematically, evaluating strengths and weaknesses, and using findings to inform their own design work. | Declaring one product 'better' without considering different user needs; Analysing products without connecting findings to their own design work |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Technical drawing (annotated sketches, exploded diagrams) communicates not just what the product looks like but how its structure will enable its function — annotating design decisions makes the structure-function reasoning explicit.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- How does the shape or arrangement help it do its job?
- Can you find two different structures that do the same thing? How do they compare?
- If you were designing this, what would you keep and what would you change?
- Why is this material or structure better suited than another?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Research-informed design requires pupils to use evidence gathered about user needs and existing products to justify their design criteria — each design decision becomes a claim that must be supported by research evidence.

---

## Session structure: Design, Make, Evaluate

### Design, Make, Evaluate
The core Design & Technology cycle. Pupils investigate existing products and user needs, design a solution with clear specifications, plan the making process, construct using appropriate materials and techniques, test against the design brief, and evaluate the outcome with suggestions for improvement.

`investigate` → `design` → `plan` → `make` → `test` → `evaluate`

**Assessment:** Design portfolio including investigation findings, annotated design with specifications, making log, test results, and evaluative conclusion comparing outcome to original brief.

**Teacher note:** Use the DESIGN, MAKE AND EVALUATE template: investigate existing products to understand how they meet a need. Guide pupils to create a design specification, produce labelled designs, plan the order of making, and use tools and materials with increasing accuracy. Include testing against the original specification and a structured evaluation of the finished product.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What is the design specification, and how does your design meet it?
- What tools and techniques will you use, and why?
- How accurately have you followed your design?
- How well does your product meet the specification? What improvements would you make?

## Design and Technology: Structures

**Design brief:** Design and make packaging for a small product (e.g. a chocolate egg, a piece of jewellery, a toy). The packaging must protect the product, display it attractively, and include the product name and information.

**Materials:** card (various weights), coloured paper, clear acetate (for windows), tape, glue
**Tools:** scissors, ruler, pencil, scoring tool (adult supervised), set square
**Techniques:** net drawing, scoring and folding, tab construction, surface design, prototype testing
**Safety notes:** Scoring tools (craft knives or bone folders) require adult supervision. All scoring should be done on a cutting mat. Demonstrate safe scoring technique: ruler firmly held, score away from fingers.

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Does the packaging protect the product?
- Can you see or access the product?
- Does it include product information?
- Is the construction neat and well-finished?

---

## Why this study matters

Designing packaging for a real product teaches shell structures (structures whose strength comes from their shape rather than internal framework) while connecting to real-world design. Pupils disassemble existing packaging to understand nets, folds, and tabs. They then design packaging for a specific product, learning that form follows function -- the packaging must protect, display, and inform.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Net drawn too small for the product -- always measure the product first and add tolerances
2. Tabs too small to create strong joints -- minimum 1cm tab width
3. Forgetting to include product information on the packaging -- design the graphics as well as the structure
