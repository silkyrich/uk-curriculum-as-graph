## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Accurate Making and Material Processing (DT-KS2-C006)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Accurate making refers to the ability to execute practical tasks — measuring, marking out, cutting, shaping, joining and finishing — with precision so that a product matches the design intention and meets functional requirements. At KS2, pupils develop accuracy as a deliberate goal, understanding that imprecise making produces products that do not work correctly or are of poor quality. Material processing knowledge — understanding how different materials respond to cutting, bending, folding, sewing or mixing — enables pupils to select and apply the most effective technique for the material and task at hand.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach measuring and marking out as essential precursors to cutting: measure twice, cut once. Provide opportunities to practise cutting accurately to a marked line with different tools on different materials. Introduce the concept of tolerance: how close to the intended dimension does a measurement need to be for the product to function? Compare products made with and without careful measuring to demonstrate the importance of accuracy. Develop vocabulary for processing different materials: score and fold (card), cut and sew (fabric), chop and mix (food), drill and screw (wood and plastic).

**Key vocabulary:** accuracy, measure, mark out, cut, shape, join, finish, tolerance, material, process, technique, precision, tool, equipment, quality

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may rush the measuring and marking stage, leading to cumulative inaccuracies in the finished product. Establishing that time spent measuring carefully is recovered by avoiding mistakes during making is an important lesson. Some pupils equate more material or more joins with a stronger or better product, rather than understanding that precision in fewer, well-executed joins is more effective.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Measuring and cutting materials to a marked line with reasonable accuracy using basic tools. | Measure and cut a piece of card that is 20cm long. Use a ruler and pencil to mark it first. | Not measuring from the zero mark on the ruler; Cutting without marking first, leading to inaccurate lengths |
| **Developing** | Measuring, marking out and cutting with accuracy across different materials, understanding that accuracy in early stages prevents problems later. | Mark out and cut three pieces of wood that are all exactly 12cm long. They need to be the same length to fit together. | Measuring only one piece carefully and estimating the others; Cutting on the line rather than just outside it, losing material and ending up too short |
| **Expected** | Working with precision across the full making process, selecting appropriate tools and techniques for each material, and explaining how accuracy affects the quality of the finished product. | Make a box with a lid that fits snugly. All edges must be straight and the lid must close properly. | Not planning for tolerance — making the lid exactly the same size as the box so it doesn't fit; Using imprecise tools (scissors instead of a craft knife) for work that requires straight edges |

> **Model response (Entry):** *I put the ruler along the edge, marked 20cm with a pencil, drew a line across using the ruler, then cut along the line. My piece is 20cm.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *I measured each piece carefully using a ruler, marking clearly with a pencil line all the way around. I used a saw and cut just outside the line, then sanded to the exact mark. I checked all three against each other — they match.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *I measured and marked all pieces on a cutting mat with a steel ruler. I scored fold lines with a bone folder so they fold cleanly. I cut with a craft knife against the ruler for straight edges. The lid fits because I made it 2mm larger than the box opening on each side — this tolerance means it sits on top without being too loose or too tight. If my measurements had been even 5mm off, the lid wouldn't fit.*

### Secondary concept: Technical Drawing and Design Communication (DT-KS2-C002)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Technical drawing involves representing design ideas using conventions that communicate information about how a product looks, how it is constructed and how its parts relate to each other. At KS2, pupils learn to use annotated sketches, cross-sectional diagrams, exploded diagrams, pattern pieces and computer-aided design to communicate their ideas clearly and accurately to others who will make or evaluate the product.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Drawing a labelled sketch of a design idea showing the main features and materials. | Drawing without any labels or annotations; Drawing an artistic picture rather than a design that could be made |
| **Developing** | Using annotated sketches with dimensions, and creating at least one alternative design to compare options. | Not including dimensions so the design cannot be accurately made; Not comparing the designs against criteria — just choosing a favourite |
| **Expected** | Communicating designs using annotated sketches, cross-sections or exploded diagrams, with dimensions and construction notes sufficient for someone else to follow. | Drawing only one view when multiple views are needed to understand the design; Not including enough detail for someone else to build from the drawing |

### Secondary concept: History and Influence of Design and Technology (DT-KS2-C009)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Design and technology has been shaped by key individuals, inventions, events and movements that have transformed how people live, work and communicate. Understanding the historical development of design and technology — from Isambard Kingdom Brunel's engineering to the Apple Macintosh, from the spinning jenny to the Internet — gives pupils perspective on design as a human activity with cultural significance and social impact. At KS2, pupils are introduced to significant moments and people in the history of design and technology and consider how these have influenced the products and systems we use today.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recalling a significant designer, inventor or design event and stating what they did or created. | Confusing the individual with another historical figure; Not being able to name a specific creation or achievement |
| **Developing** | Describing the problem a designer or inventor was solving and explaining how their solution changed people's lives. | Describing the invention without explaining the problem it solved; Not connecting the invention to its impact on everyday life |
| **Expected** | Explaining how a design innovation reflects its historical and cultural context, and discussing how design and technology have evolved over time. | Presenting the Industrial Revolution as purely positive or purely negative; Not connecting historical changes in production to modern design and manufacturing |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Selecting functional and aesthetic material properties for a specific application requires pupils to match material characteristics to the structural and functional demands of the product — a direct structure-function reasoning task.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- How does the shape or arrangement help it do its job?
- Can you find two different structures that do the same thing? How do they compare?
- If you were designing this, what would you keep and what would you change?
- Why is this material or structure better suited than another?

**Secondary lens:** Systems and System Models — Electrical and computer-controlled systems are multi-component systems where input sensors, a controller, and output actuators interact — pupils must model the system as a whole to design a product where all components work together.

## Session structure: Design, Make, Evaluate

### Design, Make, Evaluate
The core Design & Technology cycle. Pupils investigate existing products and user needs, design a solution with clear specifications, plan the making process, construct using appropriate materials and techniques, test against the design brief, and evaluate the outcome with suggestions for improvement.

`investigate` → `design` → `plan` → `make` → `test` → `evaluate`

**Assessment:** Design portfolio including investigation findings, annotated design with specifications, making log, test results, and evaluative conclusion comparing outcome to original brief.

**Teacher note:** Use the DESIGN, MAKE AND EVALUATE template: investigate existing products to understand how they meet a need. Guide pupils to create a design specification, produce labelled designs, plan the order of making, and use tools and materials with increasing accuracy. Include testing against the original specification and a structured evaluation of the finished product.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What is the design specification, and how does your design meet it?
- What tools and techniques will you use, and why?
- How accurately have you followed your design?
- How well does your product meet the specification? What improvements would you make?

## Design and Technology: Structures

**Design brief:** Design and build a bridge to span a 30cm gap between two tables. The bridge must hold the maximum possible weight. You may choose beam, arch, or truss design -- but must justify your choice.

**Materials:** card strips, wooden lollipop sticks, straws, string, tape, PVA glue
**Tools:** scissors, ruler, glue gun (adult supervised), weights for testing
**Techniques:** triangulation, laminating for strength, arch construction, joint reinforcement, load testing
**Safety notes:** Glue gun: adult supervision only. Ensure testing weights are added gradually and controlled -- do not drop weights onto bridges. Test area should be clear of pupils in case of sudden structural failure.

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Does the bridge span the full 30cm gap?
- How much weight does it hold?
- Is the design choice (beam/arch/truss) justified?
- Are the joints well-constructed?

---

## Why this study matters

Bridges are the classic structures project because they have a clear, testable success criterion: how much weight can the bridge hold before it fails? Comparing beam, arch, and truss designs teaches that the same materials arranged differently produce vastly different strengths. This is engineering principles made tangible through direct experiment.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. All pupils build the same design -- set it as a competition with different constraints for each team
2. Joints as the failure point, not the structure -- teach that joints must be as strong as members
3. Not testing incrementally -- add weight gradually to observe how the structure responds
