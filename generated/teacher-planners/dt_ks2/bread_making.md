## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Cooking Techniques and Food Preparation (DT-KS2-C010)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Cooking techniques are the methods used to prepare and transform food ingredients into dishes: chopping, peeling, grating, mixing, boiling, baking, frying, steaming and so on. Each technique requires specific skills and tools and produces different effects on the food in terms of flavour, texture, colour and nutritional content. At KS2, pupils learn a range of predominantly savoury cooking techniques and apply them to prepare dishes that are balanced, nutritious and appropriately presented. Practical cooking competence supports pupils' ability to feed themselves and others a healthy diet.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach cooking techniques progressively, adding complexity as pupils develop competence. Practise knife skills, food hygiene and safety procedures consistently. Connect cooking to design and technology through the design-make-evaluate cycle: plan a dish, cook it, evaluate it. Discuss how different cooking methods affect the same ingredient: what happens to an onion when it is raw, fried, boiled or roasted? Make predominantly savoury dishes to reflect the curriculum emphasis, covering a range of cooking methods across different projects.

**Key vocabulary:** technique, cook, prepare, ingredient, chop, mix, boil, bake, fry, steam, blend, season, hygiene, safety, nutrition, recipe

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may think that only baking counts as cooking, missing the wide range of cooking methods available. Broadening experience across different techniques challenges this assumption. Food hygiene may seem less interesting than cooking itself; making clear connections between specific hygiene practices and specific risks (cross-contamination, bacteria growth) makes the rationale concrete.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Following a simple recipe to prepare a dish, demonstrating safe food handling and basic techniques (washing, chopping, mixing). | Follow this recipe to make a fruit salad. Wash, peel and chop the fruit safely. | Not washing hands or fruit before starting; Using the knife unsafely — cutting towards the body or using the wrong grip |
| **Developing** | Using a range of cooking techniques (chopping, grating, boiling, baking) with increasing independence, and understanding why food hygiene matters. | Make a simple pasta sauce using chopping, frying and simmering techniques. | Having the heat too high and burning food; Not understanding why simmering is different from boiling |
| **Expected** | Planning and cooking a dish as part of the design-make-evaluate cycle: researching, adapting a recipe, cooking it, and evaluating the result against criteria. | Design and cook a healthy savoury snack for your class. Research, adapt a recipe, cook it, and evaluate. | Cooking without first designing or adapting the recipe; Not connecting the cooking process to the DT design-make-evaluate cycle |

> **Model response (Entry):** *I washed the grapes and apple. I peeled the orange. I used the bridge technique to hold and chop the apple into small pieces. I mixed all the fruit in a bowl.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *I washed my hands and put on an apron. I chopped onions using the claw grip to protect my fingers. I fried the onions in oil on a low heat until soft. I added tinned tomatoes and herbs and simmered the sauce for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. I cleaned up as I went.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *I researched what snacks the class enjoys and checked for allergies. I adapted a flapjack recipe to make it savoury by replacing sugar with cheese and herbs. I measured ingredients accurately, mixed, pressed into a tin and baked for 20 minutes at 180°C. In evaluation, the class rated flavour 4/5 and texture 3/5. I would add more cheese next time for stronger flavour and press the mixture more firmly for better texture.*

### Secondary concept: Seasonality and Ingredient Sourcing (DT-KS2-C011)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Seasonality refers to the natural cycles by which different foods are available at different times of year. Seasonal ingredients are typically fresher, more nutritious, more economical and have a lower environmental impact because they require less energy-intensive production or long-distance transport. Understanding where and how ingredients are grown, reared, caught and processed — from field to fork — connects pupils to the food system and to issues of environmental and social sustainability in food production.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying some foods that grow at certain times of year in the UK and understanding that food comes from farms. | Thinking all fruit is available year-round regardless of season; Not knowing which fruits grow in the UK and which are imported |
| **Developing** | Explaining what seasonality means and why eating seasonal, local food can be better for the environment. | Not connecting food miles and greenhouse growing to environmental impact; Thinking 'seasonal' means the same thing as 'organic' |
| **Expected** | Tracing a food product from source to plate, explaining each stage of production, processing and distribution, and evaluating the environmental and ethical implications. | Describing the journey without addressing ethical or environmental implications; Presenting a one-sided view without acknowledging complexity |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Cooking techniques work through specific physical and chemical transformations — heat causes proteins to denature, acid causes pastry to become flaky — and pupils must understand these causal processes to select and apply techniques correctly.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- What caused this to happen?
- How could we check if that is the reason?
- Is there more than one reason?
- What would happen if we changed just one thing?

**Secondary lens:** Systems and System Models — Seasonality and sourcing requires pupils to model the food supply system: understanding how growing season, geography and supply chain decisions determine ingredient availability and quality positions food choices within a larger system.

## Session structure: Design, Make, Evaluate

### Design, Make, Evaluate
The core Design & Technology cycle. Pupils investigate existing products and user needs, design a solution with clear specifications, plan the making process, construct using appropriate materials and techniques, test against the design brief, and evaluate the outcome with suggestions for improvement.

`investigate` → `design` → `plan` → `make` → `test` → `evaluate`

**Assessment:** Design portfolio including investigation findings, annotated design with specifications, making log, test results, and evaluative conclusion comparing outcome to original brief.

**Teacher note:** Use the DESIGN, MAKE AND EVALUATE template: investigate existing products to understand how they meet a need. Guide pupils to create a design specification, produce labelled designs, plan the order of making, and use tools and materials with increasing accuracy. Include testing against the original specification and a structured evaluation of the finished product.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What is the design specification, and how does your design meet it?
- What tools and techniques will you use, and why?
- How accurately have you followed your design?
- How well does your product meet the specification? What improvements would you make?

## Design and Technology: Cooking And Nutrition

**Design brief:** Design and bake a bread roll with a twist -- add herbs, cheese, seeds, or other flavourings to create your own signature recipe. The bread must be well-risen and fully baked.

**Materials:** strong bread flour, dried yeast, salt, warm water, olive oil, various flavourings (herbs, cheese, seeds, olives, sundried tomatoes)
**Tools:** mixing bowls, measuring scales, measuring jugs, baking trays, oven (adult use), cling film, cooling racks
**Techniques:** measuring ingredients, mixing dough, kneading, proving, shaping, baking, testing for doneness
**Safety notes:** Oven use by adults only. Demonstrate safe handling of hot baking trays with oven gloves. Ensure adequate hand washing before and during food preparation. Check for gluten allergies -- provide gluten-free flour alternative if needed. Sharp knives for scoring bread: adult demonstration, supervised pupil use.

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Is the bread well-risen?
- Is it fully baked (sounds hollow when tapped)?
- Does the flavouring work well?
- Is it appealing in appearance?
**Food allergens:** gluten (flour), possible: dairy (cheese), possible: nuts (if seeds used)
**Food skills:** measuring, mixing, kneading, shaping, baking, testing doneness

## Why this study matters

Bread is one of the most transformative cooking projects because the ingredients are so simple (flour, water, yeast, salt) yet the process (kneading, proving, baking) produces something dramatically different. The science of yeast (a living organism that produces carbon dioxide) connects powerfully to Science. The history of bread connects to every civilisation. Kneading develops patience and rhythm.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Dough not kneaded enough -- it should be smooth and elastic (10 minutes minimum)
2. Proving in too cold a room -- yeast needs warmth; near a radiator is ideal
3. Opening the oven door during baking -- temperature drop causes bread to collapse
