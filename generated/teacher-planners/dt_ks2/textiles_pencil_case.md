## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Accurate Making and Material Processing (DT-KS2-C006)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Accurate making refers to the ability to execute practical tasks — measuring, marking out, cutting, shaping, joining and finishing — with precision so that a product matches the design intention and meets functional requirements. At KS2, pupils develop accuracy as a deliberate goal, understanding that imprecise making produces products that do not work correctly or are of poor quality. Material processing knowledge — understanding how different materials respond to cutting, bending, folding, sewing or mixing — enables pupils to select and apply the most effective technique for the material and task at hand.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach measuring and marking out as essential precursors to cutting: measure twice, cut once. Provide opportunities to practise cutting accurately to a marked line with different tools on different materials. Introduce the concept of tolerance: how close to the intended dimension does a measurement need to be for the product to function? Compare products made with and without careful measuring to demonstrate the importance of accuracy. Develop vocabulary for processing different materials: score and fold (card), cut and sew (fabric), chop and mix (food), drill and screw (wood and plastic).

**Key vocabulary:** accuracy, measure, mark out, cut, shape, join, finish, tolerance, material, process, technique, precision, tool, equipment, quality

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may rush the measuring and marking stage, leading to cumulative inaccuracies in the finished product. Establishing that time spent measuring carefully is recovered by avoiding mistakes during making is an important lesson. Some pupils equate more material or more joins with a stronger or better product, rather than understanding that precision in fewer, well-executed joins is more effective.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Measuring and cutting materials to a marked line with reasonable accuracy using basic tools. | Measure and cut a piece of card that is 20cm long. Use a ruler and pencil to mark it first. | Not measuring from the zero mark on the ruler; Cutting without marking first, leading to inaccurate lengths |
| **Developing** | Measuring, marking out and cutting with accuracy across different materials, understanding that accuracy in early stages prevents problems later. | Mark out and cut three pieces of wood that are all exactly 12cm long. They need to be the same length to fit together. | Measuring only one piece carefully and estimating the others; Cutting on the line rather than just outside it, losing material and ending up too short |
| **Expected** | Working with precision across the full making process, selecting appropriate tools and techniques for each material, and explaining how accuracy affects the quality of the finished product. | Make a box with a lid that fits snugly. All edges must be straight and the lid must close properly. | Not planning for tolerance — making the lid exactly the same size as the box so it doesn't fit; Using imprecise tools (scissors instead of a craft knife) for work that requires straight edges |

> **Model response (Entry):** *I put the ruler along the edge, marked 20cm with a pencil, drew a line across using the ruler, then cut along the line. My piece is 20cm.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *I measured each piece carefully using a ruler, marking clearly with a pencil line all the way around. I used a saw and cut just outside the line, then sanded to the exact mark. I checked all three against each other — they match.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *I measured and marked all pieces on a cutting mat with a steel ruler. I scored fold lines with a bone folder so they fold cleanly. I cut with a craft knife against the ruler for straight edges. The lid fits because I made it 2mm larger than the box opening on each side — this tolerance means it sits on top without being too loose or too tight. If my measurements had been even 5mm off, the lid wouldn't fit.*

### Secondary concept: Research-Informed Design (DT-KS2-C001)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

At KS2, effective design is grounded in research that identifies the needs, preferences and constraints relevant to a product. Research may involve interviewing potential users, examining existing products, investigating materials, or exploring relevant contexts. The findings from research are used to develop design criteria that shape the design process and provide the basis for evaluation.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Carrying out basic research before designing: examining an existing product or asking a simple question about user needs. | Looking at products without making observations about design features; Starting to design without doing any research |
| **Developing** | Conducting structured research (user interviews, product analysis, or contextual investigation) and using findings to create design criteria. | Writing criteria based on own preferences rather than research findings; Conducting research but not connecting it to the design brief |
| **Expected** | Using multiple research methods to inform a design, translating findings into specific, measurable design criteria, and justifying design choices with evidence. | Designing a solution that doesn't address the actual user needs identified in research; Not being able to trace design decisions back to specific research findings |

### Secondary concept: Functional and Aesthetic Material Properties (DT-KS2-C007)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Materials have both functional properties — characteristics that determine how they perform in use, such as strength, flexibility, conductivity and waterproofness — and aesthetic properties — characteristics that determine how they appear and feel, such as colour, texture, pattern, translucency and surface quality. At KS2, pupils learn to consider both dimensions when selecting materials for a design task, understanding that a material must be both functionally suitable and appropriately appealing for the product to succeed. This concept extends KS1 material knowledge by making the functional/aesthetic distinction explicit.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying simple material properties (strong, flexible, waterproof, soft) and choosing a material for a stated purpose. | Choosing based on colour or familiarity rather than functional properties; Not being able to name the relevant property that makes the material suitable |
| **Developing** | Considering both functional and aesthetic properties when selecting materials, and explaining the trade-offs between them. | Considering only function or only aesthetics, not both; Not recognising that combining materials can solve trade-off problems |
| **Expected** | Analysing materials systematically against multiple criteria and making justified selections, considering functional performance, aesthetic quality and fitness for purpose. | Choosing a material without comparing alternatives; Not using criteria systematically — just going with initial instinct |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Selecting functional and aesthetic material properties for a specific application requires pupils to match material characteristics to the structural and functional demands of the product — a direct structure-function reasoning task.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- How does the shape or arrangement help it do its job?
- Can you find two different structures that do the same thing? How do they compare?
- If you were designing this, what would you keep and what would you change?
- Why is this material or structure better suited than another?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Research-informed design requires pupils to use evidence gathered about user needs and existing products to justify their design criteria — each design decision becomes a claim that must be supported by research evidence.

## Session structure: Design, Make, Evaluate

### Design, Make, Evaluate
The core Design & Technology cycle. Pupils investigate existing products and user needs, design a solution with clear specifications, plan the making process, construct using appropriate materials and techniques, test against the design brief, and evaluate the outcome with suggestions for improvement.

`investigate` → `design` → `plan` → `make` → `test` → `evaluate`

**Assessment:** Design portfolio including investigation findings, annotated design with specifications, making log, test results, and evaluative conclusion comparing outcome to original brief.

**Teacher note:** Use the DESIGN, MAKE AND EVALUATE template: investigate existing products to understand how they meet a need. Guide pupils to create a design specification, produce labelled designs, plan the order of making, and use tools and materials with increasing accuracy. Include testing against the original specification and a structured evaluation of the finished product.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What is the design specification, and how does your design meet it?
- What tools and techniques will you use, and why?
- How accurately have you followed your design?
- How well does your product meet the specification? What improvements would you make?

## Design and Technology: Textiles

**Design brief:** Design and make a pencil case that holds at least 6 pencils, has a secure fastening, and reflects your personal design. Research what makes a good pencil case before you start.

**Materials:** felt or cotton fabric, thread, buttons, Velcro strips, ribbon, fabric glue, embroidery thread
**Tools:** fabric scissors, needles (sharp), pins, tape measure, fabric marker
**Techniques:** measuring and cutting fabric, running stitch, backstitch, attaching fastenings, surface decoration, edge finishing
**Safety notes:** Sharp needles required for backstitch through cotton -- direct supervision essential. Pin management: count pins before and after use; use pin cushions. Fabric scissors should be handled with care -- demonstrate carrying technique. Needles stored in needle books when not in use.

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Does it hold at least 6 pencils?
- Does the fastening work securely?
- Are the seams strong?
- Does the design reflect your intentions?

---

## Why this study matters

A pencil case is a functional textile product that pupils will actually use -- the strongest motivator for quality work. The project teaches cutting fabric accurately, joining with running stitch and backstitch, adding a fastening (button, Velcro, zip), and finishing edges. The product must be both functional (strong enough to hold pencils) and aesthetic (reflecting personal design choices).

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Fabric pieces not matching after cutting -- pin pattern pieces and cut through both layers simultaneously
2. Stitches too far apart -- demonstrate that closer stitches make stronger seams
3. Fastening not strong enough -- test with pencils inside before finishing
