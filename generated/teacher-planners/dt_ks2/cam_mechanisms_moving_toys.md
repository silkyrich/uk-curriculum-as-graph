## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Advanced Mechanical Systems (DT-KS2-C003)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Mechanical systems use physical components to transmit, redirect or transform motion and force. At KS2, pupils extend their KS1 knowledge of levers, sliders and wheels to include gears, pulleys, cams and linkages, understanding how these more complex mechanisms change the speed, direction and type of movement in a product. Pupils apply this knowledge by incorporating appropriate mechanisms into their own designed products.

**Teaching guidance:** Use construction kits with gear systems to explore how gear ratios affect speed. Investigate pulley systems to explore how they multiply force. Examine cams of different shapes and how they produce different patterns of movement. Study real products that use these mechanisms - clocks, bicycles, engines. Challenge pupils to design products that require a specific type of movement and to select an appropriate mechanism to achieve it.

**Key vocabulary:** gear, pulley, cam, linkage, lever, rotation, linear motion, oscillation, gear ratio, input motion, output motion, crank, mechanism

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may confuse gears of different sizes without understanding that larger gears rotate more slowly than smaller ones when meshed. Hands-on investigation with real gear systems is essential. Pupils may not understand that cams produce different patterns of movement depending on their shape - this requires practical investigation of various cam profiles.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying gears, pulleys and cams in existing products or construction kits and describing what movement they create. | Look at this gear mechanism. What happens when you turn the big gear? | Not noticing that meshed gears turn in opposite directions; Thinking both gears turn at the same speed |
| **Developing** | Explaining how gears, pulleys or cams change the speed, direction or type of movement, and incorporating a simple mechanism into a product. | Add a cam mechanism to your toy so that a figure moves up and down when you turn a handle. | Using a round cam and wondering why the follower doesn't move up and down; Not securing the cam to the axle so it slips instead of turning |
| **Expected** | Selecting and combining mechanical systems to achieve a specific movement in a designed product, explaining the mechanical advantage and how components interact. | Design a fairground ride model that uses gears to make the ride spin more slowly than the handle you turn. Explain your gear choice. | Choosing gears without considering the ratio and its effect on speed; Not being able to explain why the mechanism produces the desired movement |

> **Model response (Entry):** *When I turn the big gear, the small gear turns too but it goes in the opposite direction. The small gear also spins faster than the big gear.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *I attached an egg-shaped cam to the axle. When I turn the handle, the axle spins and the cam pushes the follower up and down. The egg shape makes it go up slowly and drop down quickly.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *I used a small driver gear with 10 teeth connected to a large driven gear with 30 teeth. This gives a 3:1 ratio, so the ride spins three times slower than I turn the handle. This makes it look realistic — real fairground rides don't spin as fast as you turn a crank. The large gear is attached to the ride platform.*

### Secondary concept: Research-Informed Design (DT-KS2-C001)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

At KS2, effective design is grounded in research that identifies the needs, preferences and constraints relevant to a product. Research may involve interviewing potential users, examining existing products, investigating materials, or exploring relevant contexts. The findings from research are used to develop design criteria that shape the design process and provide the basis for evaluation.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Carrying out basic research before designing: examining an existing product or asking a simple question about user needs. | Looking at products without making observations about design features; Starting to design without doing any research |
| **Developing** | Conducting structured research (user interviews, product analysis, or contextual investigation) and using findings to create design criteria. | Writing criteria based on own preferences rather than research findings; Conducting research but not connecting it to the design brief |
| **Expected** | Using multiple research methods to inform a design, translating findings into specific, measurable design criteria, and justifying design choices with evidence. | Designing a solution that doesn't address the actual user needs identified in research; Not being able to trace design decisions back to specific research findings |

### Secondary concept: Accurate Making and Material Processing (DT-KS2-C006)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Accurate making refers to the ability to execute practical tasks — measuring, marking out, cutting, shaping, joining and finishing — with precision so that a product matches the design intention and meets functional requirements. At KS2, pupils develop accuracy as a deliberate goal, understanding that imprecise making produces products that do not work correctly or are of poor quality. Material processing knowledge — understanding how different materials respond to cutting, bending, folding, sewing or mixing — enables pupils to select and apply the most effective technique for the material and task at hand.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Measuring and cutting materials to a marked line with reasonable accuracy using basic tools. | Not measuring from the zero mark on the ruler; Cutting without marking first, leading to inaccurate lengths |
| **Developing** | Measuring, marking out and cutting with accuracy across different materials, understanding that accuracy in early stages prevents problems later. | Measuring only one piece carefully and estimating the others; Cutting on the line rather than just outside it, losing material and ending up too short |
| **Expected** | Working with precision across the full making process, selecting appropriate tools and techniques for each material, and explaining how accuracy affects the quality of the finished product. | Not planning for tolerance — making the lid exactly the same size as the box so it doesn't fit; Using imprecise tools (scissors instead of a craft knife) for work that requires straight edges |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Selecting functional and aesthetic material properties for a specific application requires pupils to match material characteristics to the structural and functional demands of the product — a direct structure-function reasoning task.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- How does the shape or arrangement help it do its job?
- Can you find two different structures that do the same thing? How do they compare?
- If you were designing this, what would you keep and what would you change?
- Why is this material or structure better suited than another?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Research-informed design requires pupils to use evidence gathered about user needs and existing products to justify their design criteria — each design decision becomes a claim that must be supported by research evidence.

## Session structure: Design, Make, Evaluate

### Design, Make, Evaluate
The core Design & Technology cycle. Pupils investigate existing products and user needs, design a solution with clear specifications, plan the making process, construct using appropriate materials and techniques, test against the design brief, and evaluate the outcome with suggestions for improvement.

`investigate` → `design` → `plan` → `make` → `test` → `evaluate`

**Assessment:** Design portfolio including investigation findings, annotated design with specifications, making log, test results, and evaluative conclusion comparing outcome to original brief.

**Teacher note:** Use the DESIGN, MAKE AND EVALUATE template: investigate existing products to understand how they meet a need. Guide pupils to create a design specification, produce labelled designs, plan the order of making, and use tools and materials with increasing accuracy. Include testing against the original specification and a structured evaluation of the finished product.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What is the design specification, and how does your design meet it?
- What tools and techniques will you use, and why?
- How accurately have you followed your design?
- How well does your product meet the specification? What improvements would you make?

## Design and Technology: Mechanisms

**Design brief:** Design and make a moving toy using a cam mechanism. When the handle is turned, a character or scene on top must move up and down. Design a character that suits the movement.

**Materials:** MDF or thick card for housing, wooden dowels for axles, pre-cut cam shapes (or card cams), wooden pegs for followers, card for characters
**Tools:** scissors, saw (junior hacksaw, adult supervised), drill (adult use), glue gun (adult use), ruler
**Techniques:** cam and follower assembly, axle fitting, housing construction, handle attachment, character design
**Safety notes:** Junior hacksaw use requires direct adult supervision -- demonstrate clamping the workpiece, cutting action, and safe storage. Drill use by adults only. Glue gun use by adults only or with direct 1:1 supervision. Ensure all edges are sanded smooth.

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Does the cam mechanism work smoothly?
- Does the character move as intended?
- Is the housing stable and well-finished?
- Does the handle turn easily?

## Why this study matters

Cam mechanisms convert rotational motion (turning a handle) into linear motion (a figure bobbing up and down). Making a cam toy teaches this conversion through direct experience -- turn the handle, watch the follower rise and fall. Different cam profiles (circular, pear, snail) produce different movement patterns, teaching that the shape of a component determines its function.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Cam and follower not aligned -- the follower slides off the cam; precise positioning matters
2. Wooden dowel axle too thick for the housing -- drill holes to match dowel diameter exactly
3. Decorative figure too heavy for the cam to lift -- keep the follower light
