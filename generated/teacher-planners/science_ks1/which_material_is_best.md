## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Object vs Material Distinction (SC-KS1-C024)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

The conceptual distinction between an object (a made thing with a function, such as a chair, a bottle, or a window) and the material it is made from (the substance of which it consists, such as wood, glass, or plastic). This is a foundational concept in chemistry that underpins all further study of materials. An object can be made from multiple materials; the same material can be used to make many different objects.

**Teaching guidance:** Use a 'what is it made of?' routine when handling objects. Deliberately choose objects made from one obvious material first, then introduce objects made from multiple materials. Classroom hunts where pupils label each object and its material(s) are effective. Emphasise the question 'What is it made from?' as distinct from 'What is it?'

**Key vocabulary:** object, material, made from, made of, wood, plastic, glass, metal, contains

**Common misconceptions:** Children frequently name an object when asked what it is made of (e.g., saying 'table' when the material is 'wood'). Some children believe that only man-made things are materials, not natural materials like rock or water.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Beginning to distinguish between what an object is and what it is made from, when prompted by the teacher. | I am holding a wooden spoon. What is the object? What is it made from? | Answering 'spoon' for both questions — naming the object when asked for the material; Not understanding the question 'What is it made from?' |
| **Developing** | Consistently distinguishing object from material for several everyday items, beginning to notice that the same object can be made from different materials. | Name the object and the material for each: a glass bottle, a plastic ruler, a metal coin. | Saying 'glass' is the object rather than the material; Not recognising that 'plastic' is a material, not a type of object |
| **Expected** | Explaining the difference between an object and a material, and recognising that a single object can be made from more than one material. | Look at this pair of scissors. Is 'scissors' a material or an object? What materials is it made from? Why might it use more than one material? | Not noticing that the scissors has more than one material; Not being able to explain why different materials are used for different parts |
| **Greater Depth** | Explaining that the same material can be used to make many different objects, and the same object can be made from different materials, giving examples and reasons. | Give two examples of objects that can be made from glass. Then give two different materials a bottle could be made from. Why might you choose one material over another for a bottle? | Thinking each material can only be used for one purpose; Not giving a reason for choosing one material over another |

> **Model response (Entry):** *The object is a spoon. It is made from wood.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Glass bottle: the object is a bottle, the material is glass. Plastic ruler: the object is a ruler, the material is plastic. Metal coin: the object is a coin, the material is metal.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Scissors is an object — something made for a purpose (cutting). It is made from two materials: metal for the blades because metal is hard and sharp, and plastic for the handles because plastic is comfortable to hold and does not hurt your hand. Different parts use different materials because each material has properties suited to that job.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *Glass can be used to make windows and drinking glasses — because it is transparent and smooth. A bottle could be made from glass or plastic. A glass bottle is heavier but does not change the taste; a plastic bottle is lighter and does not break if you drop it, which is safer for children. The choice depends on what matters most — weight, safety, or keeping the taste.*

### Secondary concept: Close Observation (SC-KS1-C002)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

The skill of carefully attending to and noticing details about objects, organisms and phenomena. Close observation at KS1 involves using multiple senses (while maintaining safety) and simple equipment such as hand lenses to reveal details not visible to the naked eye. Mastery is shown when pupils can describe what they observe with increasing precision and use observations as evidence.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Looking at an object or organism and describing one or two things they notice using everyday language, with teacher prompting. | Describing what they expect to see rather than what they actually observe; Giving a single-word answer ('green') without describing what they notice |
| **Developing** | Using more than one sense to observe carefully and describing several features, beginning to use simple scientific vocabulary. | Relying only on sight and not using other senses; Describing the object's name or use rather than its observable features |
| **Expected** | Making detailed observations using appropriate senses and simple equipment (hand lens), recording what they see through drawings or words with increasing precision. | Drawing from memory rather than from careful observation (e.g. adding features not visible); Holding the hand lens too far from the object to get a clear view |
| **Greater Depth** | Comparing observations of two or more specimens, noting similarities and differences in detail, and using observations as evidence to answer a question. | Noting only differences and not similarities, or vice versa; Making identification guesses without linking them to observed features |

### Secondary concept: Simple Testing (SC-KS1-C003)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Carrying out simple practical investigations to answer scientific questions. At KS1 this includes comparative tests (which of these is best for...?) and observation-based investigations. Pupils begin to understand the idea of keeping things the same (a rudimentary understanding of fair testing) and changing just one thing at a time. Mastery is evident when pupils can carry out a simple test independently and describe what they did and found out.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Following a teacher-led investigation step by step, observing what happens and describing the result with support. | Describing what they wanted to happen rather than what actually happened; Not watching carefully enough to notice the difference |
| **Developing** | Carrying out a simple test with a partner, following given instructions, and recording the result in a simple format. | Using different numbers of drops on each material without realising it makes the test unfair; Recording only 'yes' or 'no' without describing what they observed |
| **Expected** | Setting up a simple comparative test with some independence, keeping one thing the same while changing another, and describing what the results show. | Changing more than one thing at a time (different amounts of water and different sized pieces); Choosing the material they like best rather than the one the evidence supports |
| **Greater Depth** | Planning and carrying out a simple test independently, explaining why they kept things the same to make it fair, and suggesting what they would do differently next time. | Not explaining why keeping things the same matters for fairness; Not thinking about how to improve the test when reflecting |

### Secondary concept: Material Identification (SC-KS1-C025)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

The ability to recognise and name common everyday materials: wood, plastic, glass, metal, water, rock, brick, paper, cardboard, fabric, elastic and foil. Building a broad vocabulary of material names allows pupils to describe the world with precision and is prerequisite to studying material properties and suitability.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Naming two or three common everyday materials (wood, plastic, metal) when shown examples. | Naming the object instead of the material; Calling all hard materials 'metal' |
| **Developing** | Naming a wider range of everyday materials including wood, plastic, glass, metal, water, rock, fabric and paper. | Confusing glass with clear plastic; Not recognising fabric as a material (calling it 'cloth' or 'curtain') |
| **Expected** | Identifying all NC-specified materials (wood, plastic, glass, metal, water, rock, brick, paper, cardboard, fabric, elastic, foil) and distinguishing between similar-looking materials by testing properties. | Thinking transparent objects are always glass; Not thinking of ways to test beyond looking |
| **Greater Depth** | Classifying materials as natural or manufactured and explaining that some manufactured materials are designed to have specific properties. | Thinking all materials humans use are manufactured; Not recognising that glass is manufactured from natural materials (sand) |

### Secondary concept: Material Properties (SC-KS1-C026)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Knowledge and understanding of the physical properties of common materials expressed through paired descriptors: hard/soft, stretchy/stiff, shiny/dull, rough/smooth, bendy/not bendy, waterproof/not waterproof, absorbent/not absorbent, opaque/transparent. Pupils test and describe properties of materials through direct sensory investigation and simple tests. Mastery involves accurately describing a material's properties using scientific vocabulary.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Describing one property of a given material using simple paired descriptors (hard/soft, rough/smooth), with teacher modelling. | Using general terms like 'nice' or 'not nice' instead of property words; Confusing rough with hard |
| **Developing** | Using several paired descriptors to describe the properties of materials: hard/soft, rough/smooth, shiny/dull, bendy/stiff. | Describing what the material looks like (silver) rather than its properties; Using only one descriptor and struggling to think of more |
| **Expected** | Testing and describing a range of material properties including waterproof/not waterproof, absorbent/not absorbent, opaque/transparent, and recording results systematically. | Confusing transparent with translucent (frosted glass lets some light through but is not transparent); Not testing properly — guessing rather than dripping water to check waterproofness |
| **Greater Depth** | Recognising that the same material can have different properties depending on how it has been treated, and that properties can be tested and measured rather than just described. | Thinking each material has fixed properties that can never be changed; Not realising that manufactured changes to materials are deliberate design choices |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Scientific observations and enquiry serve to establish causal relationships; framing questions around 'what causes X' gives purpose to the observation work.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What made that happen?
- What will happen if...?
- Why did it change?
- Can you finish: it happened because...?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — This cluster asks pupils to gather, record or communicate scientific findings — the core cognitive demand is evaluating what counts as valid evidence and how to present it clearly.

---

## Session structure: Fair Test

### Fair Test
The classic scientific enquiry: formulating a testable question, making a prediction based on scientific understanding, designing a method that controls variables, collecting and recording data systematically, analysing results, and drawing a conclusion linked back to the original hypothesis.

`question` → `hypothesis` → `method` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `conclusion`

**Assessment:** Structured scientific report including question, hypothesis with reasoning, method with variables identified, results table/graph, and conclusion evaluating whether results support the hypothesis.

**Teacher note:** Use the FAIR TEST template: start with a simple question that children can investigate by changing one thing and seeing what happens. Help them predict what they think will happen using 'I think... because...' sentences. Guide them to observe carefully using their senses, and talk about what they found out. Keep tests hands-on with everyday materials.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What do you think will happen? Why?
- What did you change? What did you keep the same?
- What did you find out?
- Was your guess right? What surprised you?

---

## Variables

**Independent:** type of material
**Dependent:** amount of water passing through
**Controlled:** amount of water, size of material

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- material samples (fabric, plastic bag, foil, paper, card, cling film)
- small teddy bear or toy
- water spray bottle or watering can
- measuring spoon
- paper towels

**Safety notes:** Mop up water spills promptly to prevent slipping. Ensure glass samples are not used for the waterproof test. Supervise water pouring to avoid flooding the table. (Hazard level: low)

---

## Expected outcome

Children discover that different materials have different properties (waterproof, absorbent, flexible, strong) that make them suitable for different purposes. Plastic and foil keep teddy dry because they are waterproof; paper and fabric let water through because they are absorbent.

**Recording format:** simple tables, verbal descriptions

---

## Enquiry type

### Fair Test
A controlled investigation where one variable is deliberately changed while all others are kept the same, to determine whether the changed variable has an effect on a measured outcome. The gold-standard enquiry type for causal questions in science.

**Question stems:**
- How does [independent variable] affect [dependent variable]?
- Does changing [variable] make a difference to [outcome]?
- What is the relationship between [variable A] and [variable B]?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What will you change? (independent variable)
- What will you measure or observe? (dependent variable)
- What will you keep the same? (controlled variables)
- What do you predict will happen? Why?
- Was your prediction correct? What does the evidence show?


---

## Why this study matters

This is the most widely taught KS1 fair test because the context is immediately meaningful (keeping teddy dry), the variables are tangible, and the results are visible and dramatic. Children can see and feel the difference between waterproof and absorbent materials, making the abstract concept of material properties concrete. The investigation builds early fair testing skills: changing one thing, observing the result, and comparing materials systematically.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Children pour different amounts of water on each material, making comparison unfair — agree a standard amount before starting
2. Pupils focus only on waterproofness and miss other material properties (strength, flexibility) — discuss why plastic bags are waterproof but not strong enough for some purposes
3. Recording is verbal only and not captured — provide a simple table with material names pre-printed so children tick or draw results

## Working scientifically skills (KS1)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Asking questions** — Posing simple questions about observations and recognising that different types of question require different approaches to find an answer, including tests, observations over time, and looking in books.
- **Observing closely** — Using the senses and simple equipment such as magnifying glasses to make careful first-hand observations of objects, organisms and phenomena.
- **Performing simple tests** — Carrying out simple practical investigations to explore questions, with early awareness that some things should be kept the same while one thing is changed.
- **Identifying and classifying** — Sorting and grouping objects, organisms or materials according to their observable characteristics, recognising that things can be classified in more than one way depending on which features are selected.
- **Using observations to suggest answers** — Making connections between what has been observed and possible answers to questions, explaining reasoning in accessible language and recognising when observations support or challenge initial ideas.
- **Gathering and recording data** — Collecting information from observations or tests and presenting it in simple forms including drawings, labelled diagrams, tables and pictograms to support answering a scientific question.
