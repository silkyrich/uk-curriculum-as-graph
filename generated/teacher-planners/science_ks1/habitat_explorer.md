This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Living, Dead and Never Alive (SC-KS1-C032)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

The ability to classify things into three categories: living (currently alive), dead (was once alive but is no longer), and never alive (was never a living thing). This requires understanding what it means to be alive - that living things show life processes such as growth, movement, nutrition and reproduction. Common tricky cases include fire (never alive), a piece of wood (dead - was once part of a living tree), and a dried leaf (dead).

**Teaching guidance:** Use a variety of real objects for sorting: a live plant, a pressed flower, a stone, a piece of wood, a plastic toy, a dried seed, a feather, a seashell. Discuss reasoning for each classification. Ask 'Was this ever alive? Is it still alive? How do you know?'. Introduce the idea that living things show certain signs of life.

**Key vocabulary:** living, alive, dead, never alive, life, was once, grow, move, breathe, feed

**Common misconceptions:** Children commonly think fire is alive (it moves, grows, and 'breathes' oxygen). They may also think clouds or rivers are alive. A very common error is classifying wood as 'never alive' rather than 'dead' (was part of a living tree). Seeds are often wrongly classified as 'never alive' or 'dead'.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Sorting familiar items into 'alive' and 'not alive' with teacher support, using simple everyday reasoning. | Sort these items: a cat, a stone, a daisy, a toy car. Which are alive and which are not? | Thinking the daisy is not alive because it does not move; Classifying the toy car as alive because it can move |
| **Developing** | Using the three categories — living, dead and never alive — and giving a reason for each classification. | Sort these into living, dead and never alive: a growing tree, a fallen leaf, a pebble, a worm, a wooden chair, a plastic bottle. | Classifying the wooden chair as 'never alive' instead of 'dead'; Classifying the fallen leaf as 'never alive' because it looks dry |
| **Expected** | Accurately classifying a range of items including tricky examples (fire, seeds, shells, dried flowers) and justifying each choice by referring to life processes. | Classify these as living, dead or never alive: a dry seed, a fire, a seashell, a spider, a piece of coal. Explain the tricky ones. | Classifying the dry seed as dead because it does not seem to be doing anything; Classifying fire as living because it moves, grows and seems to 'breathe' oxygen |
| **Greater Depth** | Explaining why the living/dead/never alive classification is useful in science, and handling ambiguous cases by reasoning about life processes. | A robot can move, respond to sounds and follow instructions. Is it alive? A Venus flytrap can close its leaves when a fly lands on them. Is it alive? Explain how you decide. | Thinking movement alone means something is alive; Not recognising that plants are alive because they do not move in obvious ways |

> **Model response (Entry):** *Alive: cat, daisy. Not alive: stone, toy car.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Living: growing tree (it is still growing), worm (it moves and eats). Dead: fallen leaf (it was part of a living tree but is no longer alive), wooden chair (the wood came from a tree that was alive). Never alive: pebble (rock was never living), plastic bottle (plastic was never alive).*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Living: spider (it moves, eats, grows, reproduces), dry seed (it is alive but dormant — if you add water it will germinate). Dead: seashell (the shell was made by a living creature that has died), coal (formed from dead plants millions of years ago). Never alive: fire (it is not a living thing even though it seems to move and grow — it does not eat, reproduce, or have cells). The seed is tricky because it looks dead but is actually alive and resting.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *The robot is never alive — even though it moves and responds, it was built by people from metal and plastic (never alive materials). It does not grow, eat, breathe or reproduce on its own. It only does what it was programmed to do. The Venus flytrap is alive — it is a plant that grows, makes its own food from sunlight, and reproduces by making seeds. It moves to catch insects, which gives it extra nutrients. We decide if something is living by checking for life processes like growth, nutrition and reproduction, not just movement.*

### Secondary concept: Asking Scientific Questions (SC-KS1-C001)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

The ability to formulate questions about the natural world that can be investigated through scientific means. At KS1, pupils learn that some questions can be answered by watching and observing over time, some by carrying out a test, some by sorting and classifying, and some by looking in books or other sources. Developing the habit of asking 'How do we find out?' is foundational to scientific thinking.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Asking simple questions about things they observe, using stems such as 'What is it?' and 'What does it do?', with teacher prompting. | Asking questions that are statements in disguise ('I wonder it is green'); Only asking questions about things they already know the answer to |
| **Developing** | Asking questions that can be answered by observing or finding out, beginning to distinguish between questions they can investigate and questions they need to research. | Confusing 'find out by watching' with 'find out by asking the teacher'; Asking only research questions and not considering observation |
| **Expected** | Asking questions that lead to a simple test or comparison, using stems like 'What would happen if...?' and 'Which one is best for...?' | Asking questions that are too broad to test ('Which paper towel is best?' without specifying what 'best' means); Asking questions that cannot be answered by a simple test ('Why was this paper towel invented?') |
| **Greater Depth** | Independently generating testable questions and suggesting how they might be investigated, choosing between observation, testing, sorting or research. | Suggesting a method that does not match the question asked; Not considering how to make the comparison fair (different amounts of water) |

### Secondary concept: Life Processes (SC-KS1-C033)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

The characteristics that define living things: movement, respiration, sensitivity (response to stimuli), growth, reproduction, excretion and nutrition (often remembered by the mnemonic MRSGREN). At KS1, pupils do not need to know all seven formally, but should understand that living things share certain essential characteristics including growth, movement (even plants move slowly), feeding, and producing offspring.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Naming one or two things that living things do, such as grow and eat, when prompted. | Saying 'move' without recognising that non-living things (rivers, clouds) can also move; Struggling to name any life processes beyond movement |
| **Developing** | Naming several characteristics of living things: they grow, eat (feed), move and produce young (reproduce). | Listing activities (playing, sleeping) rather than life processes; Not including 'reproduce' as it may be an unfamiliar concept |
| **Expected** | Describing several life processes (growth, feeding, movement, reproduction, sensitivity) and using them to explain why something is or is not alive. | Agreeing with the child because plants do not obviously move; Listing life processes without applying them to the specific example |
| **Greater Depth** | Applying life process criteria to challenging examples and explaining why all the criteria matter, not just one. | Thinking the crystal is alive because it grows; Not distinguishing biological growth from physical accumulation of material |

### Secondary concept: Habitat Concept (SC-KS1-C034)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Understanding that a habitat is a natural environment where a community of plants and animals live. Different habitats - woodland, seashore, ocean, grassland, rainforest, desert, freshwater pond - have different physical characteristics (temperature, moisture, light levels, food availability) that determine which organisms can live there. A habitat provides an organism with everything it needs to survive.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Knowing that different animals and plants live in different places, and naming one familiar habitat. | Saying animals live 'outside' without being more specific; Not using the word 'habitat' |
| **Developing** | Using the word 'habitat' to describe where an animal or plant lives, and naming several different types of habitat. | Thinking habitat means a cage or tank rather than a natural environment; Only naming exotic habitats (jungle, Arctic) and not local ones |
| **Expected** | Describing what a habitat provides for the animals and plants living there (food, water, shelter) and explaining why certain organisms live in certain habitats. | Describing only one thing the habitat provides (water) without mentioning food and shelter; Not linking the habitat features to specific animal needs |
| **Greater Depth** | Comparing two different habitats and explaining why an animal suited to one would struggle in another. | Saying only 'it would be too hot' without explaining why the bear's features cause problems; Not connecting the animal's adaptations to specific habitat conditions |

### Secondary concept: Sorting and Grouping Decisions (SC-KS1-C044)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

The scientific skill of choosing appropriate criteria for sorting a set of objects or organisms and consistently applying those criteria to form groups. This goes beyond classification as a content outcome (e.g., naming vertebrate groups) to the procedural skill of making and justifying sorting decisions. Scientists regularly make decisions about how to group things, and different classification systems can be equally valid.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Sorting objects into two given groups using a single criterion, following teacher instructions. | Sorting by colour instead of size; Being unsure where medium-sized buttons should go |
| **Developing** | Choosing their own criterion for sorting a set of objects and explaining their decision clearly. | Using a vague criterion like 'nice ones and not nice ones'; Not being able to articulate their sorting rule |
| **Expected** | Making consistent sorting decisions using a clear criterion, and re-sorting the same set using a different criterion to show that multiple valid groupings exist. | Using the same criterion both times (e.g. colour then a different colour grouping); Not recognising that the same object can belong to different groups under different criteria |
| **Greater Depth** | Evaluating which sorting criteria are most scientifically useful for a given purpose, and explaining their reasoning. | Choosing colour because it is the most obvious visual feature; Not explaining why their chosen criterion is more scientifically meaningful |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Scientific observations and enquiry serve to establish causal relationships; framing questions around 'what causes X' gives purpose to the observation work.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What made that happen?
- What will happen if...?
- Why did it change?
- Can you finish: it happened because...?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — This cluster asks pupils to gather, record or communicate scientific findings — the core cognitive demand is evaluating what counts as valid evidence and how to present it clearly.

---

## Session structure: Identifying and Classifying

### Identifying and Classifying
A scientific enquiry focused on identifying specimens, materials, or phenomena and organising them into meaningful groups. Pupils make careful observations, develop grouping criteria, apply classification systems, and understand why classification is useful in science.

`observation` → `grouping` → `criteria_development` → `classification` → `application`

**Assessment:** Classification key, sorting diagram, or identification guide created by the pupil, with written explanation of the criteria used and justification for groupings.

**Teacher note:** Use the IDENTIFYING AND CLASSIFYING template: give children a collection of objects, pictures, or living things to observe closely. Help them describe what they can see, touch, and compare. Guide them to sort the items into groups and say why they put things together. Encourage them to use simple scientific words for the features they notice.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What does it look like? What does it feel like?
- Can you sort these into groups? What is the same about each group?
- Why did you put those together?
- Can you think of another way to sort them?

---

## Variables

**Independent:** habitat type
**Dependent:** living things found

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- hand lenses
- bug pots or pooters
- sorting hoops
- identification cards
- clipboards
- tally chart templates

**Safety notes:** Supervise outdoor activity. Teach children to handle minibeasts gently and return them to their habitat. Wash hands thoroughly after handling soil, logs, and minibeasts. Check for insect stings allergies before the activity. Avoid disturbing nesting birds. (Hazard level: low)

---

## Expected outcome

Children explore microhabitats in the school grounds (under logs, in leaf litter, on walls, in long grass), identify and sort the living things they find, and begin to explain why certain organisms are found in particular habitats (shelter, food, moisture).

**Recording format:** drawings, sorting hoops, simple tallies

---

## Enquiry type

### Identifying and Classifying
An enquiry where pupils observe, identify, and sort objects, organisms, or materials into groups based on their observable characteristics. Develops careful observation, the ability to select relevant criteria for grouping, and understanding of why classification systems are useful in science.

**Question stems:**
- How can we sort these [items] into groups?
- What properties can we use to classify [these things]?
- Can you make a key to identify [these specimens]?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What can you observe about these [objects/organisms/materials]?
- What properties could you use to sort them?
- How have you decided which group each one belongs to?
- Could you sort them a different way? What would change?
- Can you make a key that someone else could use to identify them?

## Why this study matters

Exploring real habitats outdoors is far more powerful than studying habitats from photographs alone. The surprise of lifting a log and finding woodlice, worms, and beetles creates genuine curiosity and engagement. Classifying what they find into living, dead, and never-alive develops a foundational biological concept, while considering why organisms live where they do introduces the idea of adaptation at an accessible level.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Children collect minibeasts without observing them in their habitat first — establish 'observe, then collect briefly, then return' as the routine
2. The activity becomes a minibeast hunt without scientific purpose — always return to the enquiry question: 'Why do these creatures live here?'
3. Confusion between 'dead' and 'never alive' (e.g. a dry leaf is dead, a stone was never alive) — use deliberate sorting activities with ambiguous examples

## Sensitive content

- Some children are fearful of insects — do not force handling; observing with a hand lens from a distance is valid participation

## Cross-curricular opportunities

| Link | Subject | Connection | Strength |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| Our Local Area | Geography | Exploring the local environment and mapping where different habitats are found | Strong |
| Information Text: All About Animals | English | Writing simple information texts about habitats and the animals found in them | Moderate |

## Working scientifically skills (KS1)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Asking questions** — Posing simple questions about observations and recognising that different types of question require different approaches to find an answer, including tests, observations over time, and looking in books.
- **Observing closely** — Using the senses and simple equipment such as magnifying glasses to make careful first-hand observations of objects, organisms and phenomena.
- **Performing simple tests** — Carrying out simple practical investigations to explore questions, with early awareness that some things should be kept the same while one thing is changed.
- **Identifying and classifying** — Sorting and grouping objects, organisms or materials according to their observable characteristics, recognising that things can be classified in more than one way depending on which features are selected.
- **Using observations to suggest answers** — Making connections between what has been observed and possible answers to questions, explaining reasoning in accessible language and recognising when observations support or challenge initial ideas.
- **Gathering and recording data** — Collecting information from observations or tests and presenting it in simple forms including drawings, labelled diagrams, tables and pictograms to support answering a scientific question.
