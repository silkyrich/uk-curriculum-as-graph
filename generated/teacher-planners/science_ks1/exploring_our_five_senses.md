## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Animal Life Cycles (SC-KS1-C020)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Understanding that animals produce offspring that grow into adults, and that this process involves different observable stages depending on the animal. Key examples at KS1 include: egg → chick → chicken, egg → caterpillar → pupa → butterfly, spawn → tadpole → frog, and lamb → sheep. Pupils are not expected to understand the mechanisms of reproduction at this stage, only to recognise and sequence the stages of growth.

**Teaching guidance:** Rear butterflies or chicks in the classroom to observe life cycle stages directly. Use time-lapse videos for slower cycles. Sequence picture cards showing life cycle stages. Compare life cycles of different animals and notice similarities and differences. Emphasise that all animals follow some form of this growth cycle.

**Key vocabulary:** offspring, adult, grow, life cycle, egg, larva, pupa, caterpillar, tadpole, spawn, chick, hatch, metamorphosis

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think caterpillars and butterflies are completely different animals. They may not know that frogs come from frogspawn. Some children do not realise that humans also follow a life cycle (baby to adult).

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Knowing that animals produce young that grow into adults, giving one familiar example. | What does a baby chick grow into? | Thinking a chick and a chicken are different animals; Not knowing where chicks come from (eggs) |
| **Developing** | Describing the main stages of a familiar animal life cycle in the correct order, such as egg → caterpillar → pupa → butterfly. | Put these pictures of a butterfly's life cycle in the correct order: butterfly, egg, caterpillar, chrysalis. | Putting the chrysalis before the caterpillar; Thinking the butterfly comes directly from the egg |
| **Expected** | Describing and comparing the life cycles of two or three different animals, recognising that different animals go through different stages. | Compare the life cycles of a frog and a chicken. How are they similar and different? | Not recognising that frogs go through metamorphosis while chickens do not; Forgetting that both life cycles begin with eggs |
| **Greater Depth** | Explaining why life cycles are shown as circles rather than lines, and describing how an animal at each stage is suited to its environment. | Why do we draw a life cycle as a circle and not a straight line? Use the frog's life cycle to explain. | Thinking the life cycle ends when the animal becomes an adult; Not explaining why the circular diagram works better than a line |

> **Model response (Entry):** *A chick grows into a chicken (hen or cockerel).*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Egg → caterpillar → chrysalis → butterfly. The egg hatches into a caterpillar, the caterpillar makes a chrysalis, and the butterfly comes out.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Both start as eggs. A frog egg (frogspawn) hatches into a tadpole that lives in water, then grows legs and loses its tail to become a frog — this big change is called metamorphosis. A chicken egg hatches into a chick that already looks like a small chicken and grows bigger without changing shape much. Both eventually become adults that can lay eggs of their own.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *We draw it as a circle because the cycle repeats — the adult frog lays eggs, and those eggs grow into tadpoles, then froglets, then adult frogs that lay more eggs. It never stops. A tadpole is suited to living in water with its tail for swimming and gills for breathing. An adult frog is suited to living on land with legs for jumping and lungs for breathing. Each stage is adapted to a different way of life.*

### Secondary concept: Simple Testing (SC-KS1-C003)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Carrying out simple practical investigations to answer scientific questions. At KS1 this includes comparative tests (which of these is best for...?) and observation-based investigations. Pupils begin to understand the idea of keeping things the same (a rudimentary understanding of fair testing) and changing just one thing at a time. Mastery is evident when pupils can carry out a simple test independently and describe what they did and found out.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Following a teacher-led investigation step by step, observing what happens and describing the result with support. | Describing what they wanted to happen rather than what actually happened; Not watching carefully enough to notice the difference |
| **Developing** | Carrying out a simple test with a partner, following given instructions, and recording the result in a simple format. | Using different numbers of drops on each material without realising it makes the test unfair; Recording only 'yes' or 'no' without describing what they observed |
| **Expected** | Setting up a simple comparative test with some independence, keeping one thing the same while changing another, and describing what the results show. | Changing more than one thing at a time (different amounts of water and different sized pieces); Choosing the material they like best rather than the one the evidence supports |
| **Greater Depth** | Planning and carrying out a simple test independently, explaining why they kept things the same to make it fair, and suggesting what they would do differently next time. | Not explaining why keeping things the same matters for fairness; Not thinking about how to improve the test when reflecting |

### Secondary concept: Recording Scientific Findings (SC-KS1-C006)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Gathering and recording observations, measurements and conclusions in a variety of formats including drawings, labelled diagrams, simple tables, pictograms and written sentences. At KS1, the primary purpose of recording is to help pupils answer their question and to communicate findings to others. Written recording should not dominate at this stage; drawings, tables and talk are equally valid.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recording a simple observation through a drawing or by telling the teacher, with support for structure. | Drawing a fully grown plant from imagination rather than the actual seedling in front of them; Not including key observable features like the number of leaves |
| **Developing** | Recording findings using a given format such as a partially completed table or an observation sheet with headings, adding labels to drawings. | Leaving rows blank or writing unrelated information; Copying a partner's table rather than recording their own observations |
| **Expected** | Choosing an appropriate way to record findings — drawing, table, pictogram or written sentences — and including labels, headings or a title. | Choosing a recording method that does not clearly show the data (e.g. a drawing instead of a chart for numerical data); Forgetting to label axes or include a title |
| **Greater Depth** | Recording findings clearly and accurately using more than one format (e.g. a labelled diagram and a results table), explaining why the chosen format helps communicate the findings. | Using two formats that show the same information without adding anything new; Not explaining why they chose their recording methods |

### Secondary concept: Human Growth Stages (SC-KS1-C021)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Understanding that humans, like all animals, grow and change from birth to adulthood through recognisable stages: baby, toddler, child, teenager, adult. Pupils observe that at each stage humans look and can do different things. This is a personal and relevant context for understanding animal life cycles.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recognising that people start as babies and grow into adults, naming at least two stages. | Not recognising the baby as the youngest because the picture shows a toddler; Placing themselves as an adult rather than a child |
| **Developing** | Naming the main stages of human growth in order — baby, toddler, child, teenager, adult — and describing one change at each stage. | Skipping the toddler or teenager stage; Describing what people do at each stage rather than how they change |
| **Expected** | Ordering photographs of people at different growth stages, describing physical and developmental changes, and placing themselves on the timeline. | Not noticing subtle changes between adjacent stages (toddler vs. young child); Describing clothing differences rather than physical changes |
| **Greater Depth** | Comparing human growth stages with those of another animal, explaining how the human life cycle is both similar to and different from other mammals. | Focusing only on differences without noting that both are mammals with similar early stages; Not recognising that the different growth rates are significant |

### Secondary concept: Observation Over Time (SC-KS1-C040)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

The scientific process of making repeated observations at regular intervals to track change and detect patterns that cannot be seen in a single observation. Many important scientific phenomena - plant growth, seasonal change, animal development - are only visible through sustained observation over days, weeks or months. Mastery involves planning and maintaining a systematic observation schedule and using the accumulated record to draw conclusions.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Observing something at two different times and noticing that it has changed, with teacher prompting. | Saying 'nothing changed' because the change was small; Describing the plant now without comparing to before |
| **Developing** | Making repeated observations at regular intervals and recording them, noticing changes over several days or weeks. | Not recording consistently each week; Writing the same observation every week without noting specific changes |
| **Expected** | Planning a systematic observation schedule, recording changes accurately using drawings and measurements, and describing the pattern of change observed. | Checking too rarely to see the change happening (every hour for fast-melting ice); Not recording consistently, missing some observation points |
| **Greater Depth** | Using observations over time to identify patterns and make predictions about future change, and suggesting how to make the observation more reliable. | Predicting the shadow would be the same as at 3pm rather than longer; Not recognising that the observation-over-time method reveals a pattern |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Scientific observations and enquiry serve to establish causal relationships; framing questions around 'what causes X' gives purpose to the observation work.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What made that happen?
- What will happen if...?
- Why did it change?
- Can you finish: it happened because...?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — This cluster asks pupils to gather, record or communicate scientific findings — the core cognitive demand is evaluating what counts as valid evidence and how to present it clearly.

---

## Session structure: Fair Test

### Fair Test
The classic scientific enquiry: formulating a testable question, making a prediction based on scientific understanding, designing a method that controls variables, collecting and recording data systematically, analysing results, and drawing a conclusion linked back to the original hypothesis.

`question` → `hypothesis` → `method` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `conclusion`

**Assessment:** Structured scientific report including question, hypothesis with reasoning, method with variables identified, results table/graph, and conclusion evaluating whether results support the hypothesis.

**Teacher note:** Use the FAIR TEST template: start with a simple question that children can investigate by changing one thing and seeing what happens. Help them predict what they think will happen using 'I think... because...' sentences. Guide them to observe carefully using their senses, and talk about what they found out. Keep tests hands-on with everyday materials.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What do you think will happen? Why?
- What did you change? What did you keep the same?
- What did you find out?
- Was your guess right? What surprised you?

---

## Variables

**Independent:** sense used
**Dependent:** number of correct identifications
**Controlled:** objects used

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- mystery boxes or feely bags
- blindfolds
- objects with distinct textures, smells, and sounds
- tally chart template

**Safety notes:** Ensure blindfolds are clean and hygienic. Check for food allergies before using any food items in taste or smell activities. Do not use strong chemicals or allergens. Supervise blindfolded children to prevent tripping. (Hazard level: low)

---

## Expected outcome

Children identify objects using each of their five senses in turn and discover that some senses are more helpful than others for identifying particular objects. They record how many objects they correctly identified using each sense, using simple tallies.

**Recording format:** tally charts, verbal descriptions

---

## Enquiry type

### Fair Test
A controlled investigation where one variable is deliberately changed while all others are kept the same, to determine whether the changed variable has an effect on a measured outcome. The gold-standard enquiry type for causal questions in science.

**Question stems:**
- How does [independent variable] affect [dependent variable]?
- Does changing [variable] make a difference to [outcome]?
- What is the relationship between [variable A] and [variable B]?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What will you change? (independent variable)
- What will you measure or observe? (dependent variable)
- What will you keep the same? (controlled variables)
- What do you predict will happen? Why?
- Was your prediction correct? What does the evidence show?

## Why this study matters

This simple comparative test introduces Y1 children to the idea of changing one thing (which sense they use) and seeing what happens (how many objects they get right). The mystery-box format creates excitement and genuine enquiry, while the tally recording is achievable for children still developing writing skills. The activity directly connects to the statutory requirement to associate body parts with senses.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Rushing through all five senses in one lesson — spread across two sessions to allow genuine exploration of each sense
2. Taste activity dominates and becomes a food tasting rather than a science investigation — limit taste to a few carefully chosen items
3. Children describe using sight vocabulary even when blindfolded — model how to describe using touch or smell words

## Sensitive content

- Be aware of pupils with sensory impairments — adapt activities so all children can participate meaningfully using their available senses

## Cross-curricular opportunities

| Link | Subject | Connection | Strength |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| Recount: My Weekend | English | Describing objects and experiences using sensory vocabulary in recounts | Moderate |

## Working scientifically skills (KS1)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Asking questions** — Posing simple questions about observations and recognising that different types of question require different approaches to find an answer, including tests, observations over time, and looking in books.
- **Observing closely** — Using the senses and simple equipment such as magnifying glasses to make careful first-hand observations of objects, organisms and phenomena.
- **Performing simple tests** — Carrying out simple practical investigations to explore questions, with early awareness that some things should be kept the same while one thing is changed.
- **Identifying and classifying** — Sorting and grouping objects, organisms or materials according to their observable characteristics, recognising that things can be classified in more than one way depending on which features are selected.
- **Using observations to suggest answers** — Making connections between what has been observed and possible answers to questions, explaining reasoning in accessible language and recognising when observations support or challenge initial ideas.
- **Gathering and recording data** — Collecting information from observations or tests and presenting it in simple forms including drawings, labelled diagrams, tables and pictograms to support answering a scientific question.
