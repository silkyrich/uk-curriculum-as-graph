## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Plant Growth from Seeds and Bulbs (SC-KS1-C012)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Understanding that mature plants grow from seeds or bulbs, developing through observable stages from germination to mature plant. At KS1, pupils observe this process directly by growing plants, recording changes in height, leaf number, and appearance over time. Understanding that a tiny seed contains everything needed to begin a new plant is a conceptually powerful idea in biology.

**Teaching guidance:** Grow plants from both seeds (sunflower, bean, pea, cress) and bulbs (daffodil, tulip) so pupils can compare. Use transparent containers pressed against the window so root development is visible. Photograph growth weekly to create time-lapse records. Encourage measurement and drawing of plants at regular intervals.

**Key vocabulary:** seed, bulb, germinate, grow, root, shoot, seedling, mature, plant

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think seeds need light to germinate - they do not initially. They may also think that all plants grow from seeds (bulbs, cuttings, and runners are also used for propagation). Some children believe that when a seed sprouts, the seedling 'was inside the seed' in its final form.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Knowing that plants grow from seeds or bulbs, and describing a simple observation of a seed beginning to grow. | We planted some bean seeds last week. Look at your pot. What has happened? | Thinking the seed has been replaced by a different thing rather than growing into the shoot; Not noticing any change because growth was small |
| **Developing** | Describing the stages of growth from seed or bulb to mature plant based on direct observation over several weeks, using simple language. | Draw three pictures showing how your sunflower has changed from when we planted the seed to now. | Drawing the mature plant in all three stages rather than the actual observed changes; Forgetting to show that roots grow downward as the shoot grows upward |
| **Expected** | Sequencing the growth stages of a plant from seed to mature plant, recording measurements over time, and comparing growth from seeds with growth from bulbs. | We grew sunflowers from seeds and daffodils from bulbs. Describe how they both grew. What was similar and what was different? | Thinking a bulb is just a big seed rather than a different plant structure with stored food; Not recognising that both seeds and bulbs need water to start growing |
| **Greater Depth** | Explaining why seeds and bulbs contain everything needed to begin a new plant, and predicting what would happen if conditions changed during growth. | A bean seed and a daffodil bulb both grew well for three weeks. What would happen if we stopped watering them? Explain your thinking. | Thinking the plant would die immediately without water; Not considering the role of stored food in the seed or bulb as a temporary supply |

> **Model response (Entry):** *A little green shoot has come out of the soil. It has started to grow.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Picture 1: seed in soil, nothing showing. Picture 2: small green shoot with two tiny leaves poking out. Picture 3: taller stem with several bigger leaves and a flower bud forming.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Both started underground and grew a shoot upward. The sunflower seed split open and sent a root down and a shoot up. The daffodil bulb already had a tiny plant inside and grew faster at first. Both grew leaves and then flowers. The bulb was bigger than the seed to start with, so the daffodil had more stored food.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *At first they might keep growing because the seed and bulb have some stored food and there is still moisture in the soil. But after a while they would stop growing and start to wilt because plants need water to stay alive and grow. The daffodil might survive longer because bulbs store more water and food than small seeds. If we watered them again quickly, they might recover.*

### Secondary concept: Close Observation (SC-KS1-C002)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

The skill of carefully attending to and noticing details about objects, organisms and phenomena. Close observation at KS1 involves using multiple senses (while maintaining safety) and simple equipment such as hand lenses to reveal details not visible to the naked eye. Mastery is shown when pupils can describe what they observe with increasing precision and use observations as evidence.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Looking at an object or organism and describing one or two things they notice using everyday language, with teacher prompting. | Describing what they expect to see rather than what they actually observe; Giving a single-word answer ('green') without describing what they notice |
| **Developing** | Using more than one sense to observe carefully and describing several features, beginning to use simple scientific vocabulary. | Relying only on sight and not using other senses; Describing the object's name or use rather than its observable features |
| **Expected** | Making detailed observations using appropriate senses and simple equipment (hand lens), recording what they see through drawings or words with increasing precision. | Drawing from memory rather than from careful observation (e.g. adding features not visible); Holding the hand lens too far from the object to get a clear view |
| **Greater Depth** | Comparing observations of two or more specimens, noting similarities and differences in detail, and using observations as evidence to answer a question. | Noting only differences and not similarities, or vice versa; Making identification guesses without linking them to observed features |

### Secondary concept: Simple Testing (SC-KS1-C003)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Carrying out simple practical investigations to answer scientific questions. At KS1 this includes comparative tests (which of these is best for...?) and observation-based investigations. Pupils begin to understand the idea of keeping things the same (a rudimentary understanding of fair testing) and changing just one thing at a time. Mastery is evident when pupils can carry out a simple test independently and describe what they did and found out.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Following a teacher-led investigation step by step, observing what happens and describing the result with support. | Describing what they wanted to happen rather than what actually happened; Not watching carefully enough to notice the difference |
| **Developing** | Carrying out a simple test with a partner, following given instructions, and recording the result in a simple format. | Using different numbers of drops on each material without realising it makes the test unfair; Recording only 'yes' or 'no' without describing what they observed |
| **Expected** | Setting up a simple comparative test with some independence, keeping one thing the same while changing another, and describing what the results show. | Changing more than one thing at a time (different amounts of water and different sized pieces); Choosing the material they like best rather than the one the evidence supports |
| **Greater Depth** | Planning and carrying out a simple test independently, explaining why they kept things the same to make it fair, and suggesting what they would do differently next time. | Not explaining why keeping things the same matters for fairness; Not thinking about how to improve the test when reflecting |

### Secondary concept: Plant Requirements for Growth (SC-KS1-C013)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Understanding that plants need water, light and a suitable temperature to grow and stay healthy. This is tested at KS1 through simple comparative investigations. The key scientific point is that although seeds germinate without light (they have their own food stores), growing plants require light for photosynthesis. Plants also wilt and die without water, and grow poorly in extreme temperatures.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Knowing that plants need water to grow, based on everyday experience or simple observation. | Thinking the plant will be fine without water because it gets energy from the sun; Thinking plants drink water the same way people do |
| **Developing** | Naming water, light and warmth as things plants need to grow, and describing what happens when one is missing. | Listing soil as something the plant eats for food rather than a source of water and minerals; Thinking plants need light to germinate (seeds germinate in the dark) |
| **Expected** | Describing the results of a comparative investigation into plant requirements, using evidence to explain what plants need and why. | Confusing the results of the plant without light (still grows but is yellow) with the plant without water (wilts); Not linking each specific result to the specific missing requirement |
| **Greater Depth** | Explaining that plants need light to make their own food and distinguishing this from germination, which does not require light. | Agreeing completely that seeds need light to grow, not distinguishing germination from later growth; Thinking plants get their food from soil rather than making it using light |

### Secondary concept: Germination (SC-KS1-C014)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

The process by which a dormant seed begins to grow, producing a root and shoot under the right conditions of water and suitable temperature. Germination is the first stage of a plant's life cycle and is a direct observable phenomenon accessible to KS1 pupils. Understanding germination requires grasping that seeds are alive but dormant, and that activating conditions switch on growth.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Knowing that seeds can grow into new plants and observing the first visible sign of germination (a shoot appearing). | Thinking the seed has broken rather than germinated; Not noticing the root because it grows downward into the cotton wool |
| **Developing** | Describing the germination process — the seed takes in water, swells, and produces a root and then a shoot — using the word 'germinate'. | Saying the seed 'grew a plant' without describing the stages; Thinking the shoot appears before the root |
| **Expected** | Explaining that germination needs water and a suitable temperature, and that the seed contains stored food for the early stages of growth. | Thinking seeds need light to germinate; Thinking seeds need soil to germinate (they need water and warmth, not soil specifically) |
| **Greater Depth** | Explaining that a germinating seed is alive but was dormant, and connecting germination to the start of the plant life cycle. | Classifying the dry seed as 'dead' or 'never alive' because it does not look like it is doing anything; Not connecting germination to the broader life cycle concept |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Scientific observations and enquiry serve to establish causal relationships; framing questions around 'what causes X' gives purpose to the observation work.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What made that happen?
- What will happen if...?
- Why did it change?
- Can you finish: it happened because...?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — This cluster asks pupils to gather, record or communicate scientific findings — the core cognitive demand is evaluating what counts as valid evidence and how to present it clearly.

---

## Session structure: Fair Test

### Fair Test
The classic scientific enquiry: formulating a testable question, making a prediction based on scientific understanding, designing a method that controls variables, collecting and recording data systematically, analysing results, and drawing a conclusion linked back to the original hypothesis.

`question` → `hypothesis` → `method` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `conclusion`

**Assessment:** Structured scientific report including question, hypothesis with reasoning, method with variables identified, results table/graph, and conclusion evaluating whether results support the hypothesis.

**Teacher note:** Use the FAIR TEST template: start with a simple question that children can investigate by changing one thing and seeing what happens. Help them predict what they think will happen using 'I think... because...' sentences. Guide them to observe carefully using their senses, and talk about what they found out. Keep tests hands-on with everyday materials.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What do you think will happen? Why?
- What did you change? What did you keep the same?
- What did you find out?
- Was your guess right? What surprised you?

---

## Variables

**Independent:** growing condition (light, water, warmth)
**Dependent:** plant growth
**Controlled:** type of plant, pot size

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- plant pots
- cress seeds or bean seeds
- watering can
- labels
- cupboard for dark condition
- rulers

**Safety notes:** Wash hands after handling soil. Avoid allergenic plants. Do not allow children to eat experimental plants. (Hazard level: low)

---

## Expected outcome

Children observe that plants need water, light, and warmth to grow well. Plants without light grow pale and spindly. Plants without water wilt. Children record changes using simple drawings and tick charts.

**Recording format:** drawings, simple tick charts

---

## Enquiry type

### Fair Test
A controlled investigation where one variable is deliberately changed while all others are kept the same, to determine whether the changed variable has an effect on a measured outcome. The gold-standard enquiry type for causal questions in science.

**Question stems:**
- How does [independent variable] affect [dependent variable]?
- Does changing [variable] make a difference to [outcome]?
- What is the relationship between [variable A] and [variable B]?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What will you change? (independent variable)
- What will you measure or observe? (dependent variable)
- What will you keep the same? (controlled variables)
- What do you predict will happen? Why?
- Was your prediction correct? What does the evidence show?


---

## Why this study matters

This is the earliest fair test in the curriculum, introducing Y2 children to the concept of changing one thing while keeping others the same. The variables are tangible (light, water, warmth) and the results are dramatic (wilting, pale growth), making the relationship between cause and effect visible and memorable. The investigation runs over several days, developing patience and regular observation habits.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Children water plants inconsistently across conditions, undermining the comparison — establish a watering rota
2. Expecting results within one lesson rather than several days — set expectations and use a simple observation schedule
3. Confusing healthy growth with tall growth — the plant in the dark may grow tall but is pale and spindly, not healthy

## Working scientifically skills (KS1)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Asking questions** — Posing simple questions about observations and recognising that different types of question require different approaches to find an answer, including tests, observations over time, and looking in books.
- **Observing closely** — Using the senses and simple equipment such as magnifying glasses to make careful first-hand observations of objects, organisms and phenomena.
- **Performing simple tests** — Carrying out simple practical investigations to explore questions, with early awareness that some things should be kept the same while one thing is changed.
- **Identifying and classifying** — Sorting and grouping objects, organisms or materials according to their observable characteristics, recognising that things can be classified in more than one way depending on which features are selected.
- **Using observations to suggest answers** — Making connections between what has been observed and possible answers to questions, explaining reasoning in accessible language and recognising when observations support or challenge initial ideas.
- **Gathering and recording data** — Collecting information from observations or tests and presenting it in simple forms including drawings, labelled diagrams, tables and pictograms to support answering a scientific question.
