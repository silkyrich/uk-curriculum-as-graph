## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Plant Identification (SC-KS1-C009)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Recognising and naming common wild and garden plants including deciduous and evergreen trees found in the local environment. Plant identification at KS1 builds botanical vocabulary and develops observation skills as pupils attend to the specific features - leaf shape, flower colour and structure, bark texture - that distinguish species. Mastery involves confidently naming a range of plants and explaining how they were identified.

**Teaching guidance:** Take pupils outside frequently to observe real plants in context. Use simple field guides or identification keys with clear photographs. Focus on a manageable set of locally common species. Plant and tend a class garden to develop familiarity over time. Link identification to seasonal observations.

**Key vocabulary:** plant, flower, tree, deciduous, evergreen, wild, garden, species, name, identify

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think 'plant' means only flowering plants or garden plants, not trees, grasses or mosses. Broaden their conception of what counts as a plant.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recognising and naming two or three common plants from direct observation or clear photographs, with visual support. | Look at these three plants in our school garden. Can you name any of them? Here are name cards to help you: daisy, dandelion, grass. | Calling all small flowers 'daisies'; Naming a plant based on colour alone rather than its distinctive features |
| **Developing** | Naming several common wild and garden plants and one or two common trees, beginning to describe the features that help identify them. | Name five plants you can see in the school grounds. Point to one feature that helps you recognise each one. | Using colour as the only identifying feature; Confusing similar-looking plants (e.g. buttercup and dandelion) |
| **Expected** | Confidently naming a range of common wild plants, garden plants and trees, describing distinguishing features such as leaf shape, flower structure and bark texture. | Use a simple identification guide to identify these four pressed leaves. Name the tree each one came from and explain how you know. | Relying on the guide picture without checking specific features described in the key; Confusing sycamore and horse chestnut leaves, which have a similar palmate shape |
| **Greater Depth** | Identifying plants in different seasons or growth stages, explaining how the same plant looks different at different times of year. | This photograph shows an oak tree in summer and in winter. How can you tell it is the same tree? How does it change between the seasons? | Thinking the winter tree is dead rather than dormant; Not recognising the tree without its leaves |

> **Model response (Entry):** *That one is a daisy because it has white petals with a yellow middle. That one with the fluffy ball is a dandelion.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Daisy — small white petals with yellow centre. Dandelion — bright yellow flower with jagged leaves. Buttercup — shiny yellow petals. Nettle — jagged leaves with stinging hairs. Oak tree — big tree with wavy-edged leaves.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *This is an oak leaf — it has rounded lobes along the edges. This is a horse chestnut leaf — it has five leaflets joined at one point. This is a holly leaf — it is shiny, dark green and has spiky edges. This is a beech leaf — it is oval with a smooth, wavy edge and fine hairs.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *I can tell it is the same tree because the trunk and branches are the same shape. In summer it has lots of green leaves and acorns, but in winter the leaves have fallen off and you can see the bare branches. Oak trees are deciduous — they lose their leaves in autumn and grow new ones in spring.*

### Secondary concept: Asking Scientific Questions (SC-KS1-C001)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

The ability to formulate questions about the natural world that can be investigated through scientific means. At KS1, pupils learn that some questions can be answered by watching and observing over time, some by carrying out a test, some by sorting and classifying, and some by looking in books or other sources. Developing the habit of asking 'How do we find out?' is foundational to scientific thinking.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Asking simple questions about things they observe, using stems such as 'What is it?' and 'What does it do?', with teacher prompting. | Asking questions that are statements in disguise ('I wonder it is green'); Only asking questions about things they already know the answer to |
| **Developing** | Asking questions that can be answered by observing or finding out, beginning to distinguish between questions they can investigate and questions they need to research. | Confusing 'find out by watching' with 'find out by asking the teacher'; Asking only research questions and not considering observation |
| **Expected** | Asking questions that lead to a simple test or comparison, using stems like 'What would happen if...?' and 'Which one is best for...?' | Asking questions that are too broad to test ('Which paper towel is best?' without specifying what 'best' means); Asking questions that cannot be answered by a simple test ('Why was this paper towel invented?') |
| **Greater Depth** | Independently generating testable questions and suggesting how they might be investigated, choosing between observation, testing, sorting or research. | Suggesting a method that does not match the question asked; Not considering how to make the comparison fair (different amounts of water) |

### Secondary concept: Plant Structure (SC-KS1-C010)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Knowledge of the basic external parts of flowering plants and trees: roots, stem/trunk, branches, leaves, flowers (blossom), petals, fruit, seeds and bulbs. Pupils at KS1 should be able to identify these parts on real plants and in diagrams, and name them correctly. This structural knowledge is prerequisite for later KS2 work on the functions of plant parts.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Pointing to and naming two or three basic parts of a flowering plant (e.g. flower, leaf, stem) when shown a real plant or clear diagram. | Confusing the stem with the whole plant; Not knowing the word 'stem' and calling it 'the stick part' |
| **Developing** | Naming most of the basic parts of a flowering plant — roots, stem, leaves, flower, petals — and locating them on a real plant or diagram. | Placing the roots label above ground; Swapping the labels for flower and petals, not recognising petals are part of the flower |
| **Expected** | Naming all main parts of a flowering plant and a tree (roots, stem/trunk, branches, leaves, flowers/blossom, petals, fruit, seeds, bulb) and identifying them on real specimens. | Not knowing that a bulb is a plant part that stores food underground; Thinking that fruit means only sweet fruits like apples, not seed-containing structures like pea pods |
| **Greater Depth** | Comparing the parts of different plants, explaining how the same part can look different in different species while having the same basic role. | Saying that trees do not have stems (the trunk is the stem of a tree); Not recognising that acorns are seeds inside a fruit |

### Secondary concept: Deciduous vs Evergreen Trees (SC-KS1-C011)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Understanding that deciduous trees lose their leaves in autumn and regrow them in spring, while evergreen trees retain their leaves all year round. This concept connects to seasonal change and is one of the most visible examples of plant adaptation to seasonal variation. Mastery involves correctly classifying common trees as deciduous or evergreen.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recognising that some trees have leaves in winter and some do not, when observing real trees or photographs. | Thinking the tree with no leaves is dead; Not noticing the difference without prompting |
| **Developing** | Using the terms 'deciduous' and 'evergreen' to describe trees that lose their leaves and trees that keep them, with support. | Mixing up the two terms; Thinking 'evergreen' means the tree is always green in colour, not that it always has leaves |
| **Expected** | Correctly classifying common trees as deciduous or evergreen and explaining the key difference using scientific vocabulary. | Thinking all evergreen trees are conifers with needles (holly is evergreen with broad leaves); Classifying based on one observation in one season rather than year-round knowledge |
| **Greater Depth** | Explaining why deciduous trees lose their leaves as a seasonal response, and connecting this to the concept of adaptation or survival. | Thinking the wind simply blows the leaves off rather than the tree actively shedding them; Not connecting leaf loss to seasonal changes in light and temperature |

### Secondary concept: Sorting and Grouping Decisions (SC-KS1-C044)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

The scientific skill of choosing appropriate criteria for sorting a set of objects or organisms and consistently applying those criteria to form groups. This goes beyond classification as a content outcome (e.g., naming vertebrate groups) to the procedural skill of making and justifying sorting decisions. Scientists regularly make decisions about how to group things, and different classification systems can be equally valid.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Sorting objects into two given groups using a single criterion, following teacher instructions. | Sorting by colour instead of size; Being unsure where medium-sized buttons should go |
| **Developing** | Choosing their own criterion for sorting a set of objects and explaining their decision clearly. | Using a vague criterion like 'nice ones and not nice ones'; Not being able to articulate their sorting rule |
| **Expected** | Making consistent sorting decisions using a clear criterion, and re-sorting the same set using a different criterion to show that multiple valid groupings exist. | Using the same criterion both times (e.g. colour then a different colour grouping); Not recognising that the same object can belong to different groups under different criteria |
| **Greater Depth** | Evaluating which sorting criteria are most scientifically useful for a given purpose, and explaining their reasoning. | Choosing colour because it is the most obvious visual feature; Not explaining why their chosen criterion is more scientifically meaningful |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Scientific observations and enquiry serve to establish causal relationships; framing questions around 'what causes X' gives purpose to the observation work.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What made that happen?
- What will happen if...?
- Why did it change?
- Can you finish: it happened because...?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — This cluster asks pupils to gather, record or communicate scientific findings — the core cognitive demand is evaluating what counts as valid evidence and how to present it clearly.

---

## Session structure: Identifying and Classifying

### Identifying and Classifying
A scientific enquiry focused on identifying specimens, materials, or phenomena and organising them into meaningful groups. Pupils make careful observations, develop grouping criteria, apply classification systems, and understand why classification is useful in science.

`observation` → `grouping` → `criteria_development` → `classification` → `application`

**Assessment:** Classification key, sorting diagram, or identification guide created by the pupil, with written explanation of the criteria used and justification for groupings.

**Teacher note:** Use the IDENTIFYING AND CLASSIFYING template: give children a collection of objects, pictures, or living things to observe closely. Help them describe what they can see, touch, and compare. Guide them to sort the items into groups and say why they put things together. Encourage them to use simple scientific words for the features they notice.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What does it look like? What does it feel like?
- Can you sort these into groups? What is the same about each group?
- Why did you put those together?
- Can you think of another way to sort them?

---

## Variables

**Independent:** type of plant
**Dependent:** observable features

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- hand lenses
- sorting hoops
- clipboards
- plant identification cards
- coloured pencils

**Safety notes:** Supervise outdoor activity. Remind children not to touch or taste unknown plants. Check for allergenic plants (e.g. giant hogweed) in the school grounds before the walk. Wash hands after handling plants. (Hazard level: low)

---

## Expected outcome

Children can name common wild and garden plants and sort them into groups using observable features such as leaf shape, flower colour, and whether they are deciduous or evergreen.

**Recording format:** drawings, sorting hoops

---

## Enquiry type

### Identifying and Classifying
An enquiry where pupils observe, identify, and sort objects, organisms, or materials into groups based on their observable characteristics. Develops careful observation, the ability to select relevant criteria for grouping, and understanding of why classification systems are useful in science.

**Question stems:**
- How can we sort these [items] into groups?
- What properties can we use to classify [these things]?
- Can you make a key to identify [these specimens]?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What can you observe about these [objects/organisms/materials]?
- What properties could you use to sort them?
- How have you decided which group each one belongs to?
- Could you sort them a different way? What would change?
- Can you make a key that someone else could use to identify them?


---

## Why this study matters

Classifying and grouping is the most accessible enquiry type for Y1 because it requires careful observation rather than measurement. The school grounds provide an immediate, free, and endlessly varied resource. Sorting plants by observable features develops the foundational science skill of using evidence to make decisions, while the outdoor context builds enthusiasm for the natural world.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils sort by colour alone rather than considering leaf shape, size, and structure — model multi-feature sorting
2. Children pick plants rather than observing them in situ — establish a 'look but don't pick' rule before going outside
3. Rushing through the walk without stopping to observe closely — use hand lenses and drawing to slow down observation

## Cross-curricular opportunities

| Link | Subject | Connection | Strength |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| Our Local Area | Geography | Mapping where plants are found in the school grounds | Moderate |
| Drawing from Observation | Art and Design | Observational drawing of plants found on the walk | Strong |

## Working scientifically skills (KS1)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Asking questions** — Posing simple questions about observations and recognising that different types of question require different approaches to find an answer, including tests, observations over time, and looking in books.
- **Observing closely** — Using the senses and simple equipment such as magnifying glasses to make careful first-hand observations of objects, organisms and phenomena.
- **Performing simple tests** — Carrying out simple practical investigations to explore questions, with early awareness that some things should be kept the same while one thing is changed.
- **Identifying and classifying** — Sorting and grouping objects, organisms or materials according to their observable characteristics, recognising that things can be classified in more than one way depending on which features are selected.
- **Using observations to suggest answers** — Making connections between what has been observed and possible answers to questions, explaining reasoning in accessible language and recognising when observations support or challenge initial ideas.
- **Gathering and recording data** — Collecting information from observations or tests and presenting it in simple forms including drawings, labelled diagrams, tables and pictograms to support answering a scientific question.
