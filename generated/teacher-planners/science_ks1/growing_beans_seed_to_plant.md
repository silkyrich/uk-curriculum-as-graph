## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Plant Requirements for Growth (SC-KS1-C013)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Understanding that plants need water, light and a suitable temperature to grow and stay healthy. This is tested at KS1 through simple comparative investigations. The key scientific point is that although seeds germinate without light (they have their own food stores), growing plants require light for photosynthesis. Plants also wilt and die without water, and grow poorly in extreme temperatures.

**Teaching guidance:** Set up parallel investigations comparing plants grown in different conditions - with and without water, with and without light, in warm and cold locations. Record observations over two to three weeks. Help pupils connect results to the concept of plant needs. Note: seeds can germinate without light, but seedlings cannot thrive without it.

**Key vocabulary:** water, light, temperature, warmth, grow, healthy, wilt, survive, needs, conditions

**Common misconceptions:** Children commonly believe seeds need light to germinate (they do not). Many children also think plants get their food from the soil (plants make their own food via photosynthesis; they absorb water and minerals from the soil). Children may not realise that too much water is also harmful to plants.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Knowing that plants need water to grow, based on everyday experience or simple observation. | What do you think will happen if we stop watering this plant? | Thinking the plant will be fine without water because it gets energy from the sun; Thinking plants drink water the same way people do |
| **Developing** | Naming water, light and warmth as things plants need to grow, and describing what happens when one is missing. | Name three things a plant needs to grow well. What happens if it does not get enough light? | Listing soil as something the plant eats for food rather than a source of water and minerals; Thinking plants need light to germinate (seeds germinate in the dark) |
| **Expected** | Describing the results of a comparative investigation into plant requirements, using evidence to explain what plants need and why. | We grew four identical plants: one with everything it needed, one without water, one without light, and one in a cold place. Describe what happened and explain what this tells us. | Confusing the results of the plant without light (still grows but is yellow) with the plant without water (wilts); Not linking each specific result to the specific missing requirement |
| **Greater Depth** | Explaining that plants need light to make their own food and distinguishing this from germination, which does not require light. | A child says 'Seeds need light to grow.' Do you agree? Explain your answer using what we have learned. | Agreeing completely that seeds need light to grow, not distinguishing germination from later growth; Thinking plants get their food from soil rather than making it using light |

> **Model response (Entry):** *It will get dry and droopy. It might die because plants need water.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Plants need water, light and warmth. If a plant does not get enough light, it turns yellow and grows thin and tall because it is trying to find the light.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *The plant with everything grew tall and green. The one without water wilted and its leaves dried out. The one without light grew tall but was yellow and weak. The one in the cold grew very slowly. This shows plants need water to stay alive, light to be green and healthy, and warmth to grow well.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *I partly agree and partly disagree. Seeds do not need light to germinate — they sprout in the dark using the food stored inside the seed. But once the seedling has used up its stored food, it needs light to make its own food and grow green and healthy. So seeds can start to grow without light, but the plant cannot keep growing without it.*

### Secondary concept: Classification and Grouping (SC-KS1-C004)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

The process of organising objects, materials, or living things into groups based on shared observable characteristics. At KS1, pupils choose their own criteria for sorting as well as use given criteria. They begin to understand that the same set of things can be classified in more than one way, and that the classification system chosen depends on purpose. This is foundational to biological taxonomy and chemical classification.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Sorting objects into two given groups based on a single observable property, with teacher support. | Placing an object based on what it looks like rather than testing it by touch; Being unsure where to place objects that are in between (e.g. a rubber ball) |
| **Developing** | Sorting objects into groups using a criterion they have chosen themselves, and explaining their sorting rule. | Choosing a criterion that does not clearly divide all objects (e.g. 'big' and 'small' where sizes overlap); Not being able to explain their sorting rule clearly |
| **Expected** | Sorting the same set of objects in more than one way using different criteria, and recording groupings using a simple table or Venn diagram. | Thinking there is only one correct way to sort the leaves; Using colour as the only criterion rather than exploring different features |
| **Greater Depth** | Creating a simple branching sorting system (yes/no questions) to identify objects within a set, and explaining why certain criteria are more useful than others for classification. | Asking questions that do not clearly split the group into two (e.g. 'Is it nice?'); Creating a chart that does not successfully identify all specimens |

### Secondary concept: Drawing Conclusions from Evidence (SC-KS1-C005)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Using observations and data gathered to suggest answers to scientific questions. At KS1, pupils move from simply describing what they saw to connecting observations to explanations. Mastery involves being able to say not only what happened but to offer a simple reason why, based on evidence rather than imagination.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Saying what happened in a simple investigation, describing the result using everyday language with teacher prompting. | Describing what they expected rather than what actually happened; Giving a one-word answer without describing what they observed |
| **Developing** | Describing results and beginning to connect them to the question asked, using 'because' to offer a simple reason. | Stating the result without connecting it to a reason; Offering a reason based on preference ('because I like the smooth floor') rather than evidence |
| **Expected** | Using evidence from an investigation to answer the original question, distinguishing between what the evidence shows and what they think or wish. | Writing 'I think...' without referring to the evidence; Concluding that the material they predicted would win did win, even when the evidence shows otherwise |
| **Greater Depth** | Drawing a conclusion supported by evidence, noticing when results are surprising or unexpected, and suggesting what they could investigate next. | Not recognising the surprising result (dark cress growing taller); Concluding simply that 'plants need light' without addressing the unexpected observation |

### Secondary concept: Germination (SC-KS1-C014)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

The process by which a dormant seed begins to grow, producing a root and shoot under the right conditions of water and suitable temperature. Germination is the first stage of a plant's life cycle and is a direct observable phenomenon accessible to KS1 pupils. Understanding germination requires grasping that seeds are alive but dormant, and that activating conditions switch on growth.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Knowing that seeds can grow into new plants and observing the first visible sign of germination (a shoot appearing). | Thinking the seed has broken rather than germinated; Not noticing the root because it grows downward into the cotton wool |
| **Developing** | Describing the germination process — the seed takes in water, swells, and produces a root and then a shoot — using the word 'germinate'. | Saying the seed 'grew a plant' without describing the stages; Thinking the shoot appears before the root |
| **Expected** | Explaining that germination needs water and a suitable temperature, and that the seed contains stored food for the early stages of growth. | Thinking seeds need light to germinate; Thinking seeds need soil to germinate (they need water and warmth, not soil specifically) |
| **Greater Depth** | Explaining that a germinating seed is alive but was dormant, and connecting germination to the start of the plant life cycle. | Classifying the dry seed as 'dead' or 'never alive' because it does not look like it is doing anything; Not connecting germination to the broader life cycle concept |

### Secondary concept: Comparative Testing Method (SC-KS1-C039)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

A comparative test investigates which option is best for a given purpose by testing two or more options under the same conditions and comparing results. For example, 'which material is most waterproof?' tested by dripping the same amount of water on samples of equal size. At KS1, pupils begin to understand that changing one thing at a time while keeping everything else the same is what makes a test fair.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Understanding that we can test two things to see which is better for a purpose, by trying both and comparing the results, with teacher guidance. | Not watching carefully enough to compare; Saying the ball they like best bounced higher, regardless of what happened |
| **Developing** | Carrying out a simple comparative test with a partner, keeping one condition the same while comparing two or more options. | Releasing cars from different points on the ramp; Not measuring from the same starting point for each car |
| **Expected** | Planning and carrying out a comparative test, identifying what to keep the same to make the test fair, and recording results in a simple table. | Not identifying all the variables that need to stay the same; Using different sized pieces and not realising this makes the test unfair |
| **Greater Depth** | Evaluating a comparative test, identifying what could be improved to make results more reliable, and explaining why fair testing matters. | Not identifying the unfairness in the test; Suggesting improvements without explaining why the original test was flawed |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Scientific observations and enquiry serve to establish causal relationships; framing questions around 'what causes X' gives purpose to the observation work.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What made that happen?
- What will happen if...?
- Why did it change?
- Can you finish: it happened because...?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — This cluster asks pupils to gather, record or communicate scientific findings — the core cognitive demand is evaluating what counts as valid evidence and how to present it clearly.

---

## Session structure: Observation Over Time

### Observation Over Time
Systematic observation and recording of changes or patterns over an extended period. Pupils make careful observations, record findings using drawings, measurements, or logs, classify what they observe, and identify patterns or trends. Particularly suited to biological processes and artistic study of the natural world.

`observation` → `recording` → `classifying` → `pattern_identification`

**Assessment:** Observation log or journal with dated entries, annotated drawings or measurements, classification of observations, and summary identifying the key patterns or changes observed.

**Teacher note:** Use the OBSERVATION OVER TIME template: give children something interesting to watch closely — a plant growing, ice melting, or shadows moving. Help them describe what they can see using their senses. Encourage drawing or simple recording of what they notice at different times. Talk about what changed and what stayed the same.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What can you see right now?
- What has changed since last time?
- Can you draw what it looks like today?
- What do you think will happen next?

---

## Variables

**Independent:** time
**Dependent:** changes in the plant

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- bean seeds
- clear plastic cups or zip-lock bags
- damp paper towels
- plant pots
- soil
- rulers
- clipboards

**Safety notes:** Wash hands after handling seeds and soil. Do not allow children to eat seeds or experimental plants. Some children may have bean allergies — check before the activity. (Hazard level: low)

---

## Expected outcome

Children observe the stages of germination: the seed swells, the root emerges, then the shoot pushes upward. Over several weeks they record the sequence of changes through annotated drawings, building understanding that seeds grow into plants through a predictable sequence.

**Recording format:** annotated drawings, picture sequence

---

## Enquiry type

### Observation Over Time
A systematic enquiry where changes are observed and recorded at intervals over a period of time — hours, days, weeks, or longer. Used when the process being studied is too slow for a single lesson or when the pattern only emerges through repeated observation. Develops patience, systematic recording, and the ability to identify trends.

**Question stems:**
- How does [thing being observed] change over time?
- What happens to [variable] over [time period]?
- What pattern can you see in how [process] changes?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What do you think will happen over time? Why?
- How often should we observe and record?
- What exactly will we look for or measure each time?
- What pattern can you see in the observations?
- Can you explain why this pattern happens?


---

## Why this study matters

Observation over time is the ideal enquiry type for germination because the process unfolds gradually and cannot be rushed. Using clear plastic cups allows children to see root growth that is normally hidden underground, making the invisible visible. The emphasis on drawing and annotating develops scientific recording skills while the multi-week timescale teaches children that science requires patience and systematic observation.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Children overwater the seeds, causing them to rot — demonstrate that damp (not soaking) is needed
2. Drawings are rushed and lack labels — model annotated drawing explicitly, pointing out what scientists record
3. Children expect instant germination — explain that seeds take several days to sprout and set up an observation schedule

## Working scientifically skills (KS1)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Asking questions** — Posing simple questions about observations and recognising that different types of question require different approaches to find an answer, including tests, observations over time, and looking in books.
- **Observing closely** — Using the senses and simple equipment such as magnifying glasses to make careful first-hand observations of objects, organisms and phenomena.
- **Performing simple tests** — Carrying out simple practical investigations to explore questions, with early awareness that some things should be kept the same while one thing is changed.
- **Identifying and classifying** — Sorting and grouping objects, organisms or materials according to their observable characteristics, recognising that things can be classified in more than one way depending on which features are selected.
- **Using observations to suggest answers** — Making connections between what has been observed and possible answers to questions, explaining reasoning in accessible language and recognising when observations support or challenge initial ideas.
- **Gathering and recording data** — Collecting information from observations or tests and presenting it in simple forms including drawings, labelled diagrams, tables and pictograms to support answering a scientific question.
