## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Habitat Suitability and Adaptation (SC-KS1-C036)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The understanding that living things are suited to the habitats in which they live - they possess features and behaviours that allow them to survive in that habitat's specific conditions. For example, polar bears are suited to cold Arctic habitats (thick fur, fat layer); camels are suited to hot deserts (hump for fat storage, wide feet for sand). At KS1 this is introduced as a descriptive observation; causal explanation through natural selection is not expected until Year 6.

**Teaching guidance:** Use photographs of animals in their natural habitats and discuss how the animal is suited to its environment. Focus on observable features (thick fur in cold animals, streamlined shape in swimming animals). Avoid asserting that animals 'chose' their features or that adaptations were deliberately acquired.

**Key vocabulary:** suited, adapted, feature, habitat, survive, conditions, suited to, environment

**Common misconceptions:** Children often think animals actively chose or developed their adaptations (intentional fallacy). Some think all animals could survive in all habitats if they wanted to. Children may think adaptation happens within a single animal's lifetime rather than over many generations.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Noticing that animals have features that help them in their environment, with teacher prompting and a familiar example. | Look at this picture of a duck. What part of its body helps it swim? | Describing colour rather than a functional feature; Not being able to explain how the feature helps |
| **Developing** | Identifying one or two features of a familiar animal that help it survive in its habitat, using descriptive language. | How is a rabbit suited to living in a meadow? Name two features that help it survive. | Describing features that are not related to survival (e.g. 'it has a fluffy tail'); Thinking the rabbit chose to have these features |
| **Expected** | Describing how specific features of an animal or plant make it well-suited to its habitat, linking the feature to the habitat conditions. | A cactus lives in a hot, dry desert. Describe two features that help it survive there and explain how each one helps. | Describing the feature without explaining how it connects to the habitat conditions; Thinking the cactus grew spines because it decided to protect itself |
| **Greater Depth** | Comparing how two different organisms in the same habitat are suited to it in different ways, or how similar features appear in organisms in similar habitats around the world. | A seal and a penguin both live in cold seas. How is each one suited to the cold water? What is similar about their adaptations? | Not noticing the similarities in how different animals solve the same problem; Thinking adaptations are deliberate choices made by the animal |

> **Model response (Entry):** *Its webbed feet help it paddle through the water.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *A rabbit has long ears to listen for predators like foxes. It has strong back legs for running away quickly. Its brown fur helps it blend in with the grass and soil.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *A cactus has thick, waxy stems that store water inside so it can survive long periods without rain. Instead of big leaves, it has spines which lose much less water to evaporation and protect it from animals trying to eat it for the water inside. Both features help the cactus cope with the desert's extreme heat and lack of water.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *A seal has thick blubber (fat) under its skin to keep warm, smooth fur that is waterproof, and flippers for swimming fast. A penguin has a thick layer of overlapping feathers that trap air for insulation, a layer of fat, and flipper-like wings for swimming. Both have a layer of insulation (blubber/feathers) to survive the cold, and both have streamlined bodies for swimming. Even though one is a mammal and one is a bird, they have similar solutions to the same problem — staying warm and catching fish in freezing water.*

### Secondary concept: Pattern Recognition in Science (SC-KS1-C007)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Noticing regularities, relationships and trends in observations or data. At KS1, pattern recognition includes seeing that things change in predictable ways (seasons, plant growth) and that groups of things share common characteristics. Recognising patterns is central to all scientific disciplines and leads to generalisation and the formation of scientific laws and principles.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Noticing a simple repeated occurrence when prompted by the teacher, such as 'it happens every time'. | Focusing on a single day's weather rather than looking across the whole period; Describing what they remember rather than reading the chart |
| **Developing** | Identifying a simple pattern in a set of observations or results, using language like 'every time' or 'most of them'. | Describing individual animals rather than what they have in common; Claiming a pattern from just one or two examples |
| **Expected** | Identifying patterns in data they have collected and using the pattern to make a simple generalisation. | Describing only the first and last measurements without discussing the pattern in between; Confusing the pattern with a single observation ('It was tallest in week 6') |
| **Greater Depth** | Using an observed pattern to make a prediction and explaining why the pattern might exist. | Making a prediction without linking it to the observed pattern; Thinking the days will keep getting longer forever rather than recognising the seasonal cycle |

### Secondary concept: Using Secondary Sources (SC-KS1-C008)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Finding scientific information from books, photographs, videos, internet resources and by asking knowledgeable people. At KS1, pupils learn that some questions cannot be answered by observation or investigation alone, and that scientists build on the knowledge and work of others. This is an important habit of scientific inquiry.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Finding a piece of information from a book, photograph or video when directed by the teacher. | Guessing the answer without looking at the source; Looking at pictures only and not attempting to read captions or labels |
| **Developing** | Using a non-fiction book or simple source to find specific information to answer a given question, with some independence. | Copying whole sentences from the book rather than selecting relevant facts; Giving facts about the wrong animal from the same book |
| **Expected** | Choosing an appropriate source (book, photograph, video) to answer a specific question and reporting what they found, distinguishing the answer from their own opinion. | Choosing a source that does not contain the needed information and not switching to another; Mixing up their own ideas with what the source actually says |
| **Greater Depth** | Using more than one source to find information, noticing when sources agree or give different details, and explaining which source was most useful. | Using only one source and claiming they used two; Not noticing differences between what different sources say |

### Secondary concept: Interdependence in Habitats (SC-KS1-C037)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The understanding that plants and animals in a habitat depend on each other for survival. Plants produce food and oxygen that animals need; animals may pollinate plants or disperse seeds; predators control prey populations; decomposers recycle nutrients. At KS1 this is introduced simply: pupils recognise that if a key organism is removed, others are affected. This concept develops into understanding of food webs and ecosystems in KS2.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Knowing that animals eat plants or other animals to survive, showing a simple understanding that living things depend on each other. | Thinking the bird would be fine and would just eat something else, without considering availability; Not understanding the question about dependency |
| **Developing** | Describing a simple example of how two organisms depend on each other, using the idea that one provides food or shelter for the other. | Describing only one direction of the relationship (bees get nectar) without the other (flowers get pollinated); Thinking bees deliberately help flowers rather than it being a consequence of feeding |
| **Expected** | Explaining that organisms in a habitat depend on each other in multiple ways and that removing one organism affects others. | Thinking only the caterpillars would be affected, not seeing the chain reaction; Not explaining why the change would spread through the habitat |
| **Greater Depth** | Describing multiple interdependent relationships in a habitat and explaining why biodiversity (many different species) makes a habitat healthier. | Describing only a single food chain rather than the web of relationships; Not explaining why variety (biodiversity) makes the habitat more resilient |

### Secondary concept: Simple Food Chains (SC-KS1-C038)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

A food chain is a sequence showing who eats whom, starting always with a producer (a green plant that makes its own food through photosynthesis) and showing the flow of energy through herbivores, omnivores and carnivores. At KS1 pupils construct and read simple linear food chains (3-4 organisms) from their local habitat. The concept of energy transfer from food is not formally introduced until KS2.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Knowing that some animals eat plants and some eat other animals, and sequencing a simple three-step food chain with support. | Putting the bird first because it is the biggest; Not understanding which direction the arrows should go |
| **Developing** | Constructing a simple food chain from a given habitat, starting with a plant and using arrows correctly to show 'is eaten by'. | Drawing arrows pointing from predator to prey (wrong direction); Not starting with a plant |
| **Expected** | Constructing food chains from a local habitat, explaining that they always start with a green plant (producer) and using the terms producer, prey and predator. | Not including the term 'producer' or not understanding why the plant is called a producer; Not recognising that the blue tit is both predator (eats caterpillar) and prey (eaten by sparrowhawk) |
| **Greater Depth** | Predicting what would happen if one organism in a food chain were removed, explaining the effect on organisms above and below it in the chain. | Only thinking about the effect on foxes and not on the grass; Thinking the fox would just eat grass instead |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Scientific observations and enquiry serve to establish causal relationships; framing questions around 'what causes X' gives purpose to the observation work.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What made that happen?
- What will happen if...?
- Why did it change?
- Can you finish: it happened because...?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — This cluster asks pupils to gather, record or communicate scientific findings — the core cognitive demand is evaluating what counts as valid evidence and how to present it clearly.

---

## Session structure: Research Enquiry

### Research Enquiry
A structured approach to answering questions through secondary research. Pupils formulate a research question, select appropriate sources, take and organise notes, synthesise findings from multiple sources, and present their conclusions. Develops information literacy alongside subject knowledge.

`question` → `source_selection` → `note_taking` → `synthesis` → `presentation`

**Assessment:** Research report or presentation that answers the original question using evidence from multiple sources, with evaluation of source reliability where appropriate.

---

## Variables

**Independent:** None
**Dependent:** None

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- food chain picture cards
- non-fiction books about animals and habitats
- video clips of animals feeding
- arrow cards for building chains
- large paper for class food chain display

**Safety notes:** No specific physical hazards. If using video clips of predation, preview to ensure content is age-appropriate and not distressing. (Hazard level: low)

---

## Expected outcome

Children construct simple food chains (3-4 links) showing what eats what in a familiar habitat. They identify that plants are the starting point of most food chains (producers), that some animals eat plants (herbivores) and others eat animals (predators), and that the arrows show the direction of energy transfer.

**Recording format:** picture food chains, verbal descriptions

---

## Enquiry type

### Research Using Secondary Sources
An enquiry where pupils answer scientific questions using information from books, websites, databases, and other secondary sources rather than first-hand investigation. Used when the question cannot be answered by practical investigation in the classroom (e.g. space, evolution, body systems, historical scientific discoveries).

**Question stems:**
- What does the evidence tell us about [topic]?
- How do scientists explain [phenomenon]?
- What do we know about [topic] and how do we know it?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What question are we trying to answer?
- Where can we find reliable information about this?
- What are the key facts and ideas from this source?
- Do different sources agree? If not, why might they differ?
- What is the answer to our question, based on the evidence?


---

## Why this study matters

Research enquiry is the appropriate type here because food chains in wild habitats cannot be directly observed in a single lesson. Using picture cards to physically build food chains makes the abstract relationship (energy flows from plant to herbivore to predator) concrete and manipulable. Starting from the habitat explored in SE-KS1-008 connects the food chain concept to real organisms the children have already encountered.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Children draw arrows pointing from predator to prey ('the fox eats the rabbit') rather than in the direction of energy transfer — teach the arrow as 'is eaten by' or 'gives energy to'
2. Food chains start with an animal rather than a plant — always ask 'Where does the energy come from first?' to establish plants as the starting point
3. Children confuse food chains with food preferences — food chains describe ecological relationships, not what animals like to eat

## Sensitive content

- Predation can be distressing for some young children — focus on the ecological relationship rather than graphic details of hunting

---

## Cross-curricular opportunities

| Link | Subject | Connection | Strength |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| Changes Within Living Memory | History | How people used local food sources in the past; changes in farming within living memory | Moderate |
| Information Text: All About Animals | English | Writing simple information texts about animals and what they eat | Strong |

## Working scientifically skills (KS1)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Asking questions** — Posing simple questions about observations and recognising that different types of question require different approaches to find an answer, including tests, observations over time, and looking in books.
- **Observing closely** — Using the senses and simple equipment such as magnifying glasses to make careful first-hand observations of objects, organisms and phenomena.
- **Performing simple tests** — Carrying out simple practical investigations to explore questions, with early awareness that some things should be kept the same while one thing is changed.
- **Identifying and classifying** — Sorting and grouping objects, organisms or materials according to their observable characteristics, recognising that things can be classified in more than one way depending on which features are selected.
- **Using observations to suggest answers** — Making connections between what has been observed and possible answers to questions, explaining reasoning in accessible language and recognising when observations support or challenge initial ideas.
- **Gathering and recording data** — Collecting information from observations or tests and presenting it in simple forms including drawings, labelled diagrams, tables and pictograms to support answering a scientific question.
