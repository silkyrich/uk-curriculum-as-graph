## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Animal Classification by Vertebrate Group (SC-KS1-C015)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Knowledge of the five major vertebrate animal groups - fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals - and the ability to correctly classify common animals into these groups. Mastery involves understanding the key distinguishing features of each group (e.g., birds have feathers, mammals have fur and feed young on milk) and confidently classifying unfamiliar animals.

**Teaching guidance:** Use real animals where safe to do so (class fish, visiting birds of prey, handling invertebrates). Use large photographic collections for classification activities. Teach one group at a time, focusing on key distinguishing features. Note that humans are mammals. Use 'odd one out' activities to reinforce classification.

**Key vocabulary:** fish, amphibian, reptile, bird, mammal, vertebrate, group, feature, classify, scales, feathers, fur, warm-blooded, cold-blooded

**Common misconceptions:** Children commonly misclassify animals: whales as fish (they are mammals), dolphins as fish, penguins as fish. They may not know humans are mammals. Some children think all animals that live in water are fish. Children often believe that all reptiles are dangerous or all amphibians are frogs.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Naming two or three of the five vertebrate groups (fish, birds, mammals) and giving one example animal for each. | Can you name a type of animal group? Give me an example animal from that group. | Naming individual animals rather than groups (saying 'dog' is a group rather than 'mammal'); Confusing animal groups with habitats ('sea animals' instead of 'fish') |
| **Developing** | Naming all five vertebrate groups and describing one key feature of each group. | Name the five groups of vertebrate animals. What is special about each group? | Forgetting amphibians or mixing them up with reptiles; Describing where animals live rather than their physical features |
| **Expected** | Correctly classifying common animals into their vertebrate group using distinguishing features, including less obvious examples. | Which group does each of these animals belong to: whale, frog, penguin, tortoise, shark? Explain how you know. | Classifying whales or dolphins as fish because they live in water; Classifying penguins as fish because they swim |
| **Greater Depth** | Classifying unfamiliar animals by reasoning from the distinguishing features of each group, and explaining tricky cases. | A platypus has fur, lays eggs and feeds its babies milk. Which vertebrate group does it belong to? Explain why this is tricky. | Saying it must be a reptile because it lays eggs; Thinking an animal must fit every single feature perfectly to belong to a group |

> **Model response (Entry):** *Fish — goldfish. Birds — robin. Mammals — dog.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Fish live in water and have scales and fins. Amphibians live in water and on land and have smooth wet skin. Reptiles have dry scaly skin. Birds have feathers and beaks. Mammals have fur or hair and feed their babies milk.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Whale — mammal, because it breathes air, has warm blood and feeds its baby milk. Frog — amphibian, because it starts life in water as a tadpole and lives on land as an adult with moist skin. Penguin — bird, because it has feathers and a beak even though it cannot fly. Tortoise — reptile, because it has dry scaly skin and lays eggs on land. Shark — fish, because it lives in water and has gills and fins.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *A platypus is a mammal because it has fur and feeds its babies milk. It is tricky because it also lays eggs, which is unusual for mammals — most mammals give birth to live young. But the key feature of mammals is that they feed babies milk, and the platypus does this. This shows that classification rules usually work but there can be unusual exceptions.*

### Secondary concept: Asking Scientific Questions (SC-KS1-C001)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

The ability to formulate questions about the natural world that can be investigated through scientific means. At KS1, pupils learn that some questions can be answered by watching and observing over time, some by carrying out a test, some by sorting and classifying, and some by looking in books or other sources. Developing the habit of asking 'How do we find out?' is foundational to scientific thinking.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Asking simple questions about things they observe, using stems such as 'What is it?' and 'What does it do?', with teacher prompting. | Asking questions that are statements in disguise ('I wonder it is green'); Only asking questions about things they already know the answer to |
| **Developing** | Asking questions that can be answered by observing or finding out, beginning to distinguish between questions they can investigate and questions they need to research. | Confusing 'find out by watching' with 'find out by asking the teacher'; Asking only research questions and not considering observation |
| **Expected** | Asking questions that lead to a simple test or comparison, using stems like 'What would happen if...?' and 'Which one is best for...?' | Asking questions that are too broad to test ('Which paper towel is best?' without specifying what 'best' means); Asking questions that cannot be answered by a simple test ('Why was this paper towel invented?') |
| **Greater Depth** | Independently generating testable questions and suggesting how they might be investigated, choosing between observation, testing, sorting or research. | Suggesting a method that does not match the question asked; Not considering how to make the comparison fair (different amounts of water) |

### Secondary concept: Animal Classification by Diet (SC-KS1-C016)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Understanding that animals can be classified by what they eat: carnivores eat other animals only, herbivores eat plants only, and omnivores eat both plants and animals. This classification reflects animals' ecological roles and is foundational to understanding food chains. Mastery involves correctly classifying familiar and unfamiliar animals and explaining the basis for classification.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Knowing that some animals eat plants and some eat other animals, with familiar examples. | Thinking all animals eat the same kinds of food; Not distinguishing between the two ideas without visual support |
| **Developing** | Using the terms herbivore, carnivore and omnivore correctly and giving examples of each. | Mixing up herbivore and carnivore; Not knowing that humans are omnivores |
| **Expected** | Classifying a range of familiar and less familiar animals as herbivore, carnivore or omnivore, using evidence from their diet or physical features. | Thinking caterpillars are too small to classify, or not recognising them as herbivores; Classifying badgers as carnivores when they actually eat plants and animals (omnivores) |
| **Greater Depth** | Linking diet classification to body features (teeth, claws) and to the animal's position in a food chain. | Thinking all pointed teeth mean carnivore without considering the whole set; Not recognising that tooth shape is evidence of diet rather than just appearance |

### Secondary concept: Animal Body Structures - Comparative (SC-KS1-C017)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

The ability to compare and describe the external body structures of different vertebrate animals, identifying both similarities (all have a head, most have four limbs, all have a backbone) and key differences (feathers vs fur vs scales, wings vs fins vs legs). This comparative anatomy builds a scientific basis for animal classification.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying one or two visible differences between two familiar animals when shown pictures or specimens side by side. | Describing differences in colour or size rather than body structure; Saying 'the fish lives in water' (habitat) rather than describing body parts |
| **Developing** | Comparing two animals by describing both similarities and differences in their body parts, using vocabulary such as limbs, body covering and tail. | Listing only differences without noting any similarities; Describing behaviour (the dog barks) rather than body structure |
| **Expected** | Comparing body structures across different vertebrate groups, linking structural features to the animal's way of life. | Describing only one animal without comparing to the others; Not linking the body feature to its function in water |
| **Greater Depth** | Using comparative body features as evidence for classifying animals, explaining why certain features are more useful for classification than others. | Grouping bats with birds because both fly; Using only one feature (wings) to classify rather than looking at multiple features |

### Secondary concept: Sorting and Grouping Decisions (SC-KS1-C044)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

The scientific skill of choosing appropriate criteria for sorting a set of objects or organisms and consistently applying those criteria to form groups. This goes beyond classification as a content outcome (e.g., naming vertebrate groups) to the procedural skill of making and justifying sorting decisions. Scientists regularly make decisions about how to group things, and different classification systems can be equally valid.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Sorting objects into two given groups using a single criterion, following teacher instructions. | Sorting by colour instead of size; Being unsure where medium-sized buttons should go |
| **Developing** | Choosing their own criterion for sorting a set of objects and explaining their decision clearly. | Using a vague criterion like 'nice ones and not nice ones'; Not being able to articulate their sorting rule |
| **Expected** | Making consistent sorting decisions using a clear criterion, and re-sorting the same set using a different criterion to show that multiple valid groupings exist. | Using the same criterion both times (e.g. colour then a different colour grouping); Not recognising that the same object can belong to different groups under different criteria |
| **Greater Depth** | Evaluating which sorting criteria are most scientifically useful for a given purpose, and explaining their reasoning. | Choosing colour because it is the most obvious visual feature; Not explaining why their chosen criterion is more scientifically meaningful |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Scientific observations and enquiry serve to establish causal relationships; framing questions around 'what causes X' gives purpose to the observation work.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What made that happen?
- What will happen if...?
- Why did it change?
- Can you finish: it happened because...?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — This cluster asks pupils to gather, record or communicate scientific findings — the core cognitive demand is evaluating what counts as valid evidence and how to present it clearly.

## Session structure: Identifying and Classifying

### Identifying and Classifying
A scientific enquiry focused on identifying specimens, materials, or phenomena and organising them into meaningful groups. Pupils make careful observations, develop grouping criteria, apply classification systems, and understand why classification is useful in science.

`observation` → `grouping` → `criteria_development` → `classification` → `application`

**Assessment:** Classification key, sorting diagram, or identification guide created by the pupil, with written explanation of the criteria used and justification for groupings.

**Teacher note:** Use the IDENTIFYING AND CLASSIFYING template: give children a collection of objects, pictures, or living things to observe closely. Help them describe what they can see, touch, and compare. Guide them to sort the items into groups and say why they put things together. Encourage them to use simple scientific words for the features they notice.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What does it look like? What does it feel like?
- Can you sort these into groups? What is the same about each group?
- Why did you put those together?
- Can you think of another way to sort them?

---

## Variables

**Independent:** type of animal
**Dependent:** observable features

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- animal picture cards
- sorting hoops
- simple classification keys
- non-fiction animal books

**Safety notes:** No specific physical hazards. If using real animals (e.g. minibeast hunt), supervise handling and ensure hand washing afterwards. Check for animal allergies before any live animal encounters. (Hazard level: low)

---

## Expected outcome

Children can sort animals into the five vertebrate groups (fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals) using observable features such as body covering, number of legs, and habitat. They can also sort by diet (carnivore, herbivore, omnivore).

**Recording format:** picture sorting, simple tables

---

## Enquiry type

### Identifying and Classifying
An enquiry where pupils observe, identify, and sort objects, organisms, or materials into groups based on their observable characteristics. Develops careful observation, the ability to select relevant criteria for grouping, and understanding of why classification systems are useful in science.

**Question stems:**
- How can we sort these [items] into groups?
- What properties can we use to classify [these things]?
- Can you make a key to identify [these specimens]?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What can you observe about these [objects/organisms/materials]?
- What properties could you use to sort them?
- How have you decided which group each one belongs to?
- Could you sort them a different way? What would change?
- Can you make a key that someone else could use to identify them?

## Why this study matters

Classifying animals is one of the most engaging science activities for Y1 because children are naturally fascinated by animals. Sorting by observable features develops the foundational scientific skill of using evidence to categorise, while the rich vocabulary (mammal, reptile, carnivore) builds the technical language needed for all future biology. Using sorting hoops and picture cards makes the abstract concept of classification concrete and physical.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Children think whales and dolphins are fish because they live in water — use body covering (hair/fur) and breathing (lungs) as sorting criteria
2. Sorting relies on colour or cuteness rather than scientific features — model using structural features (legs, body covering, where they live)
3. The activity stays at naming groups without children understanding why the groups exist — ask 'What is the same about all the animals in this group?'

## Working scientifically skills (KS1)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Asking questions** — Posing simple questions about observations and recognising that different types of question require different approaches to find an answer, including tests, observations over time, and looking in books.
- **Observing closely** — Using the senses and simple equipment such as magnifying glasses to make careful first-hand observations of objects, organisms and phenomena.
- **Performing simple tests** — Carrying out simple practical investigations to explore questions, with early awareness that some things should be kept the same while one thing is changed.
- **Identifying and classifying** — Sorting and grouping objects, organisms or materials according to their observable characteristics, recognising that things can be classified in more than one way depending on which features are selected.
- **Using observations to suggest answers** — Making connections between what has been observed and possible answers to questions, explaining reasoning in accessible language and recognising when observations support or challenge initial ideas.
- **Gathering and recording data** — Collecting information from observations or tests and presenting it in simple forms including drawings, labelled diagrams, tables and pictograms to support answering a scientific question.
