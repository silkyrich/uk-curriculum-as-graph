## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: The Four Seasons (SC-KS1-C029)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Understanding that a year is divided into four seasons - spring, summer, autumn and winter - each with characteristic weather, temperature, day length and changes to the natural world. This is one of the most fundamental patterns in the natural world, directly observable by pupils. The ability to name and characterise the four seasons is foundational to all environmental science.

**Teaching guidance:** Observe the seasons as they actually occur rather than just from pictures. Keep a seasonal journal or class diary throughout the year. Go outside regularly in all seasons. Compare seasonal photographs taken from the same viewpoint at different times of year. Link to changes in plants, animals, weather and day length.

**Key vocabulary:** season, spring, summer, autumn, winter, temperature, warm, cold, month, year, change

**Common misconceptions:** Children in the UK may have a distorted view of seasons based on books featuring idealised summer or winter conditions. Some children think it is always the same season everywhere in the world at the same time (it is summer in Australia when it is winter in the UK).

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Naming the four seasons in order, with visual support such as photographs. | Look at these four pictures. Can you name each season? Put them in order starting with spring. | Putting autumn and winter in the wrong order; Not knowing the name 'autumn' (some children say 'fall') |
| **Developing** | Describing one or two characteristics of each season, such as typical weather or changes to plants. | What is the weather usually like in summer? What about winter? | Thinking it always snows in winter in the UK; Describing idealised seasons from picture books rather than actual UK experience |
| **Expected** | Describing the characteristics of all four seasons including weather, day length and changes in the natural world, and explaining that the seasons follow a repeating annual pattern. | Describe what happens in the natural world during autumn. How is it different from spring? | Describing only the weather without mentioning changes in plants and animals; Not recognising autumn and spring as transitional seasons |
| **Greater Depth** | Explaining why the seasons follow a repeating pattern and how living things respond to seasonal changes as part of their survival. | Why do some birds fly south in autumn and return in spring? How does this link to the seasons? | Thinking birds migrate because they do not like cold weather (it is mainly about food supply); Not connecting the migration pattern to the annual seasonal cycle |

> **Model response (Entry):** *Spring, summer, autumn, winter.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *In summer it is warm and sunny with long days. In winter it is cold, the days are short, and it might snow or frost.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *In autumn, leaves on deciduous trees change colour (yellow, orange, red) and fall off. The days get shorter and cooler. Animals like squirrels collect food for winter. Some birds fly to warmer countries. In spring, it is the opposite — new leaves grow, days get longer and warmer, flowers appear, birds build nests, and baby animals are born. Autumn is when nature prepares for winter; spring is when it wakes up again.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *In autumn, the days get shorter and colder in the UK, so there are fewer insects and berries for birds to eat. Some birds like swallows fly south to warmer countries where there is still plenty of food — this is called migration. They return in spring when the UK gets warmer, days get longer, and food becomes plentiful again. The birds follow the seasonal pattern because their survival depends on having enough food, and the seasons affect food supply.*

### Secondary concept: Classification and Grouping (SC-KS1-C004)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

The process of organising objects, materials, or living things into groups based on shared observable characteristics. At KS1, pupils choose their own criteria for sorting as well as use given criteria. They begin to understand that the same set of things can be classified in more than one way, and that the classification system chosen depends on purpose. This is foundational to biological taxonomy and chemical classification.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Sorting objects into two given groups based on a single observable property, with teacher support. | Placing an object based on what it looks like rather than testing it by touch; Being unsure where to place objects that are in between (e.g. a rubber ball) |
| **Developing** | Sorting objects into groups using a criterion they have chosen themselves, and explaining their sorting rule. | Choosing a criterion that does not clearly divide all objects (e.g. 'big' and 'small' where sizes overlap); Not being able to explain their sorting rule clearly |
| **Expected** | Sorting the same set of objects in more than one way using different criteria, and recording groupings using a simple table or Venn diagram. | Thinking there is only one correct way to sort the leaves; Using colour as the only criterion rather than exploring different features |
| **Greater Depth** | Creating a simple branching sorting system (yes/no questions) to identify objects within a set, and explaining why certain criteria are more useful than others for classification. | Asking questions that do not clearly split the group into two (e.g. 'Is it nice?'); Creating a chart that does not successfully identify all specimens |

### Secondary concept: Drawing Conclusions from Evidence (SC-KS1-C005)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Using observations and data gathered to suggest answers to scientific questions. At KS1, pupils move from simply describing what they saw to connecting observations to explanations. Mastery involves being able to say not only what happened but to offer a simple reason why, based on evidence rather than imagination.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Saying what happened in a simple investigation, describing the result using everyday language with teacher prompting. | Describing what they expected rather than what actually happened; Giving a one-word answer without describing what they observed |
| **Developing** | Describing results and beginning to connect them to the question asked, using 'because' to offer a simple reason. | Stating the result without connecting it to a reason; Offering a reason based on preference ('because I like the smooth floor') rather than evidence |
| **Expected** | Using evidence from an investigation to answer the original question, distinguishing between what the evidence shows and what they think or wish. | Writing 'I think...' without referring to the evidence; Concluding that the material they predicted would win did win, even when the evidence shows otherwise |
| **Greater Depth** | Drawing a conclusion supported by evidence, noticing when results are surprising or unexpected, and suggesting what they could investigate next. | Not recognising the surprising result (dark cress growing taller); Concluding simply that 'plants need light' without addressing the unexpected observation |

### Secondary concept: Seasonal Weather Patterns (SC-KS1-C030)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Understanding that each season is typically associated with characteristic weather patterns in the UK: spring (mild, showery), summer (warm, longer days, less rain), autumn (cooling, wet, windy), winter (cold, shorter days, possibility of frost and snow). Pupils observe and describe weather over time, developing the understanding that weather patterns are broadly predictable by season.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Describing today's weather using simple words such as sunny, rainy, cloudy, windy, cold or warm. | Using only one word to describe the weather when several apply; Describing yesterday's weather instead of today's |
| **Developing** | Recording daily weather over a week or more and beginning to notice which types of weather are common in the current season. | Not counting accurately from the chart; Saying 'it rained every day' when only some days were rainy |
| **Expected** | Describing the typical weather patterns for each UK season, using data from class weather records as evidence. | Describing single memorable weather events rather than the overall pattern; Not using the class data as evidence for their statements |
| **Greater Depth** | Comparing weather across seasons using collected data, distinguishing between typical weather patterns and unusual events, and understanding that weather varies from year to year. | Thinking one unusual event disproves the seasonal pattern; Not distinguishing between daily weather and seasonal patterns |

### Secondary concept: Day Length Variation (SC-KS1-C031)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Understanding that the length of daylight (hours between sunrise and sunset) varies throughout the year, with the longest days in summer (up to about 16 hours in the UK) and the shortest in winter (as few as 8 hours). Pupils observe this directly - noticing that it is dark when they travel to school in winter but still light in summer evenings. Note: pupils must never look directly at the Sun.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Noticing from personal experience that it gets dark earlier in winter and stays light later in summer. | Not connecting their personal experience to the concept of day length; Thinking bedtime is the same as sunset |
| **Developing** | Knowing that days are longer in summer and shorter in winter, and that this pattern changes gradually through the year. | Thinking the change happens suddenly rather than gradually; Not knowing approximate times for sunset in different seasons |
| **Expected** | Describing the pattern of day length change across the year using data, and connecting longer days with summer warmth and shorter days with winter cold. Safety: never look directly at the Sun. | Making calculation errors when working out hours between sunrise and sunset; Not connecting day length to temperature differences between seasons |
| **Greater Depth** | Predicting day length patterns for months not yet recorded and explaining how day length affects plants, animals and human activity. | Thinking day length changes at the same rate every month (it changes faster around the equinoxes); Not connecting day length to animal and plant behaviour |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Scientific observations and enquiry serve to establish causal relationships; framing questions around 'what causes X' gives purpose to the observation work.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What made that happen?
- What will happen if...?
- Why did it change?
- Can you finish: it happened because...?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — This cluster asks pupils to gather, record or communicate scientific findings — the core cognitive demand is evaluating what counts as valid evidence and how to present it clearly.

---

## Session structure: Observation Over Time

### Observation Over Time
Systematic observation and recording of changes or patterns over an extended period. Pupils make careful observations, record findings using drawings, measurements, or logs, classify what they observe, and identify patterns or trends. Particularly suited to biological processes and artistic study of the natural world.

`observation` → `recording` → `classifying` → `pattern_identification`

**Assessment:** Observation log or journal with dated entries, annotated drawings or measurements, classification of observations, and summary identifying the key patterns or changes observed.

**Teacher note:** Use the OBSERVATION OVER TIME template: give children something interesting to watch closely — a plant growing, ice melting, or shadows moving. Help them describe what they can see using their senses. Encourage drawing or simple recording of what they notice at different times. Talk about what changed and what stayed the same.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What can you see right now?
- What has changed since last time?
- Can you draw what it looks like today?
- What do you think will happen next?

---

## Variables

**Independent:** season / time of year
**Dependent:** weather and environmental changes

---

## Equipment and safety

**Equipment:**
- weather symbols cards
- clipboards
- coloured pencils
- simple thermometer (visual, not digital)
- class weather chart

**Safety notes:** Supervise outdoor observation in all weather conditions. Ensure appropriate clothing for weather observation walks. Avoid thermometer breakage — use shatterproof models. (Hazard level: low)

---

## Expected outcome

Children observe and record weather patterns across the school year, noting how temperature, rainfall, daylight, and the appearance of the school grounds change through spring, summer, autumn, and winter. They develop an understanding that seasons follow a predictable annual cycle.

**Recording format:** weather symbols, drawings, picture diary

---

## Enquiry type

### Observation Over Time
A systematic enquiry where changes are observed and recorded at intervals over a period of time — hours, days, weeks, or longer. Used when the process being studied is too slow for a single lesson or when the pattern only emerges through repeated observation. Develops patience, systematic recording, and the ability to identify trends.

**Question stems:**
- How does [thing being observed] change over time?
- What happens to [variable] over [time period]?
- What pattern can you see in how [process] changes?

**Teacher scaffold:**
- What do you think will happen over time? Why?
- How often should we observe and record?
- What exactly will we look for or measure each time?
- What pattern can you see in the observations?
- Can you explain why this pattern happens?


---

## Why this study matters

Observation over time is the natural enquiry type for seasonal changes because the phenomenon unfolds across an entire year. Regular, brief outdoor observations (weekly weather recording, monthly playground photographs) build the scientific habit of systematic data collection. Children experience the evidence for seasonal change directly rather than learning about it secondhand, making the knowledge deeply rooted in personal experience.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Seasonal observation is treated as a one-off topic rather than revisited throughout the year — embed regular weather recording into the weekly routine
2. Children learn the names of seasons without connecting them to observable changes — always ask 'What has changed since last month?' and 'How do you know?'
3. Photographs or drawings from different seasons are not compared side-by-side — create a class display that shows all four seasons together

## Working scientifically skills (KS1)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Asking questions** — Posing simple questions about observations and recognising that different types of question require different approaches to find an answer, including tests, observations over time, and looking in books.
- **Observing closely** — Using the senses and simple equipment such as magnifying glasses to make careful first-hand observations of objects, organisms and phenomena.
- **Performing simple tests** — Carrying out simple practical investigations to explore questions, with early awareness that some things should be kept the same while one thing is changed.
- **Identifying and classifying** — Sorting and grouping objects, organisms or materials according to their observable characteristics, recognising that things can be classified in more than one way depending on which features are selected.
- **Using observations to suggest answers** — Making connections between what has been observed and possible answers to questions, explaining reasoning in accessible language and recognising when observations support or challenge initial ideas.
- **Gathering and recording data** — Collecting information from observations or tests and presenting it in simple forms including drawings, labelled diagrams, tables and pictograms to support answering a scientific question.
