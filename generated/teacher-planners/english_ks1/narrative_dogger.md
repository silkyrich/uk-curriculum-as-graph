## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **5 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Narrative sequencing (EN-KS1-C045)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Ordering sentences to create a coherent story

**Teaching guidance:** Teach narrative sequencing by modelling how to write short stories or recounts in chronological order. Use time connectives (first, then, next, after that, finally) to structure the sequence. Provide picture prompts or story maps that children follow when writing. Start with retelling familiar stories before moving to original narratives. In Year 1, aim for 3-4 sequenced sentences; in Year 2, extend to 6-8 sentences with clear beginning, middle and end.

**Key vocabulary:** first, then, next, after, finally, beginning, middle, end, in order, story, what happened

**Common misconceptions:** Children often write narratives that are heavily front-loaded, with extensive detail about the beginning and very little about the middle or end. They may use 'and then' repeatedly instead of varying connectives. Some children struggle to maintain a consistent narrative thread, introducing unrelated events.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Writing two or three sentences about the same topic in order, with picture support. | Write three sentences about what happens in the pictures: (picture 1: boy wakes up, picture 2: boy eats breakfast, picture 3: boy goes to school). | Writing sentences about different, unrelated topics; Describing only one picture and not sequencing |
| **Developing** | Writing a short narrative in order using time connectives (first, then, next, finally). | Write a four-sentence story about a trip to the zoo. Use the words first, then, next, finally. | Using the same connective ('then') for every sentence; Putting events in an illogical order |
| **Expected** | Writing a short narrative with a clear beginning, middle and end, maintaining a coherent sequence of events. | Write a short story about a character who finds something unexpected. Make sure it has a beginning, middle and end. | Writing a detailed beginning but rushing or omitting the ending; Events that don't connect logically to each other |
| **Greater Depth** | Writing narratives with a developed plot including a problem and resolution, using varied connectives and building tension. | Write a story about a character facing a problem. Build up to the most exciting part before showing how the problem is solved. | Including a problem but resolving it too quickly without building tension; Losing the narrative thread partway through and introducing unrelated events |

> **Model response (Entry):** *'The boy woke up. He had cereal for breakfast. Then he walked to school.'*

> **Model response (Developing):** *'First, we got on the bus. Then, we arrived at the zoo. Next, we saw the lions and monkeys. Finally, we had ice cream and went home.'*

> **Model response (Expected):** *'One sunny morning, Lily found a golden key in her garden. She tried it in every lock she could find, but none of them opened. Finally, she tried the old shed door — it opened to reveal a beautiful secret garden inside.'*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *Child writes a narrative with character introduction, rising tension, a climax and a satisfying resolution, using varied time and causal connectives, and with dialogue or description adding interest.*

- **Re-reading for sense** (EN-KS1-C046): Reading back own writing to check it makes sense
- **Planning writing** (EN-KS1-C048): Thinking ahead and organizing ideas before writing
- **Expanded noun phrases** (EN-KS1-C060): Adding adjectives to nouns for description (e.g., the blue butterfly)
- **Subordination** (EN-KS1-C063): Using when, if, that, or because to join clauses
- **Co-ordination** (EN-KS1-C064): Using or, and, or but to join clauses equally
---

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Oral rehearsal is preparation for written composition — the function of speaking sentences aloud before writing is to make the structural demands of sentence composition explicit before the motor task of transcription is added.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What shape is it? Why do you think it is that shape?
- What job does this part do?
- What would happen if this part were a different shape?
- Can you find something else that does the same job?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Evaluating and proof-reading require pupils to read their own writing as a text to be assessed — they use the evidence of what they have written to judge whether it meets the criteria of sense, accuracy and effect.

## Session structure: Text Study

### Text Study
A reading-to-writing cycle for primary and KS3 English. Begins with shared or guided reading of a high-quality text, moves through analysis of language features and authorial choices, builds vocabulary, then scaffolds the writing process from planning through drafting to editing and publication.

`shared_reading` → `analysis` → `vocabulary` → `planning` → `drafting` → `editing`

**Assessment:** Final written outcome in the genre studied, demonstrating understanding of text features, appropriate vocabulary use, and effective application of the writing process.

**Teacher note:** Use the TEXT STUDY template: read a short, engaging text together, using pictures and expression to bring it alive. Help children point out interesting words and talk about what they mean. Guide them to say what happened in the story or what the text told them. Encourage them to have a go at their own simple piece of writing inspired by the text.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What happened in the story?
- Which was your favourite word? Why do you like it?
- How did the character feel? How do you know?
- Can you write your own sentence like the one we read?

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Fiction
**Features to teach:** problem-resolution structure, character feelings and reactions, setting description, beginning, build-up, problem, resolution, ending

**Writing outcome:** Write an original narrative (8-12 sentences) about losing and finding something precious, using a clear problem-resolution structure with expanded noun phrases

**Grammar focus:** expanded noun phrases (the old, brown teddy), co-ordination (and, or, but), subordination (when, if, because), commas in lists
*(from Y2 Appendix 2)*

**Literary terms:** character, setting, problem, resolution, narrator

---

## Suggested texts

- **Dogger** by Shirley Hughes — Classic text with clear emotional arc and problem-resolution structure
- **Knuffle Bunny** by Mo Willems — Alternative lost-and-found narrative with photographic illustration

---

## Genre

- **Narrative:** Extended prose fiction with characters, setting, and a plot driven by conflict and resolution. The dominant literary form across all key stages, progressing from simple retelling (KS1) through structured narrative (KS2) to literary fiction with controlled voice and style (KS3-KS4).

---

## Why this study matters

Dogger provides a perfect model for Y2 narrative because its emotional arc is universally relatable (losing a beloved toy) and its structure is transparent. The five-part narrative structure (beginning, build-up, problem, resolution, ending) gives pupils a clear framework that is more sophisticated than KS1 beginning-middle-end but still manageable. The expanded noun phrases needed to describe the toy connect reading and grammar naturally.

## Sequencing

**Leads to:** Traditional Tales: The Enormous Turnip

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils write about their own lost toy experience as a recount rather than as a structured narrative
2. Problem is resolved too quickly without building tension
3. Expanded noun phrases used only in the opening rather than throughout

## Cross-curricular opportunities

| Link | Subject | Connection | Strength |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| Drawing from Observation | Art and Design | Drawing and describing a treasured possession using expanded noun phrases | Strong |

## Reading and writing skills (KS1)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Word meaning from context** — Understand the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in simple texts by using the surrounding context, including pictures and sentence sense, to make a reasonable guess at what the word means.
- **Information retrieval from simple texts** — Find and report specific information or key facts from a short piece of fiction or non-fiction, identifying the part of the text where the answer is located.
- **Retelling and sequencing** — Retell the main events of a story or the key steps in a non-fiction text, placing them in the correct order and identifying the most important ideas.
- **Simple inference from text** — Use clues in the text — characters' words, actions and feelings — to work out something the author has not stated directly, and begin to explain the reasoning behind that interpretation.
- **Prediction from text clues** — Predict what is likely to happen next in a story or sequence of events, drawing on what has already been read and on prior knowledge of similar texts and situations.
- **Noticing interesting words and phrases** — Identify and discuss words and phrases that capture attention or create an effect, beginning to explain what makes them interesting, surprising or effective in the context of the text.
