## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **3 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Writing for different purposes (EN-KS1-C047)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Adapting writing for different text types (narrative, recount, poetry)

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce different text types through reading before asking children to write them. Cover key purposes: narrative (stories), recount (retelling events), instruction (how to do something), information (facts about a topic), letters, and poetry. Discuss the features of each text type explicitly: 'Instructions use numbered steps and bossy verbs.' Provide model texts and writing frames to scaffold early attempts. Ensure children understand that the purpose of writing determines its form and language choices.

**Key vocabulary:** purpose, story, recount, instructions, information, letter, poem, audience, text type, for

**Common misconceptions:** Children may default to narrative structure for all writing, including instructions and information texts. They may not understand that different purposes require different language features (e.g., imperative verbs in instructions, past tense in recounts). Some children focus on content without considering who they are writing for.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Writing for a single familiar purpose (e.g., a story or a label) with adult support. | Write a sentence to go with this picture of a farm. You are writing a label to tell people about it. | Writing without awareness of the purpose (e.g., writing a story when a label was requested); Not distinguishing between different types of writing |
| **Developing** | Writing for two or three different purposes (narrative, recount, list) with some awareness that each requires different features. | Write instructions for making a sandwich. Remember to use bossy verbs and number the steps. | Writing in narrative form ('First I got the bread and then I put butter on it') instead of instruction form; Including imperative verbs but forgetting to number or sequence the steps |
| **Expected** | Writing for a range of purposes — narrative, recount, instruction, information, letter, poetry — using features appropriate to each text type. | Write a letter to a friend telling them about a trip you went on. Use the correct letter layout. | Writing a recount without the letter format (no greeting or sign-off); Mixing up the features of different text types |
| **Greater Depth** | Adapting writing style and language for different purposes and audiences, explaining why different text types need different features. | Write about the school trip twice: once as a recount for your diary and once as a report for the school newsletter. How are they different? | Writing both pieces in the same style; Explaining that they are different but not articulating how or why |

> **Model response (Entry):** *'This is a farm with cows and sheep.'*

> **Model response (Developing):** *'1. Get two slices of bread. 2. Spread butter on both slices. 3. Add cheese. 4. Put the slices together.'*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Child writes with a greeting, recounts the trip in past tense with personal detail, and ends with a sign-off.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *Diary: 'Today was the best day ever! We went to the museum and I saw a real dinosaur skeleton.' Newsletter: 'Year 2 visited the Natural History Museum on Tuesday. The children particularly enjoyed the dinosaur exhibition.' 'The diary is personal and uses I/we. The newsletter is formal and written for parents.'*

### Secondary concept: Retrieval (EN-KS1-C016)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Finding and extracting explicit information from text

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Finding explicitly stated information in a sentence when the question uses the same wording as the text. | Answering from general knowledge ('Dogs are usually brown') instead of from the text; Not looking at the text to find the answer |
| **Developing** | Finding information when the question is worded differently from the text, scanning to locate the relevant part. | Answering from memory or general knowledge without checking the text; Finding a sentence about penguins but extracting the wrong detail |
| **Expected** | Retrieving specific information from across a text, locating and pointing to evidence, including answering questions that require finding more than one piece of information. | Finding one piece of information but not both; Giving information about the wrong creature from the same text |
| **Greater Depth** | Retrieving and combining information from different parts of a text to give a complete answer, distinguishing relevant from irrelevant details. | Using information from only one paragraph when the answer spans two; Including irrelevant details about other animals from the same text |

### Secondary concept: Expanded noun phrases (EN-KS1-C060)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Adding adjectives to nouns for description (e.g., the blue butterfly)

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Adding a single adjective before a noun to describe it. | Adding a verb instead of an adjective ('The running dog'); Choosing a vague adjective ('The nice dog') |
| **Developing** | Using two adjectives before a noun, separated by a comma, to create an expanded noun phrase. | Using two similar adjectives ('the big, large castle'); Forgetting the comma between adjectives |
| **Expected** | Using expanded noun phrases in own writing to add detail and interest, choosing adjectives for precision. | Using generic adjectives ('nice', 'good', 'big') rather than precise ones; Expanding every noun phrase, making the writing feel overloaded |
| **Greater Depth** | Choosing expanded noun phrases deliberately to create a specific mood or impression, explaining the effect of adjective choices. | Using the same adjectives for both moods; Creating different moods but not being able to explain which adjectives contribute to the effect |

### Secondary concept: Commas in lists (EN-KS1-C065)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Using commas to separate items in a list

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Understanding that commas separate items when listing more than two things. | Not noticing the commas at all; Thinking commas are the same as full stops |
| **Developing** | Using commas to separate items in a list of three or more, with 'and' before the final item. | Using 'and' between every item instead of commas; Placing commas after every item including before 'and' |
| **Expected** | Using commas in lists consistently and correctly in independent writing, including lists of adjectives, nouns and verbs. | Using commas in noun lists but forgetting them in adjective or verb lists; Placing commas randomly rather than between each item |
| **Greater Depth** | Understanding that commas in lists prevent ambiguity and can change meaning. | Not seeing the ambiguity in the uncomma'd version; Understanding the joke but not connecting it to the function of commas |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Oral rehearsal is preparation for written composition — the function of speaking sentences aloud before writing is to make the structural demands of sentence composition explicit before the motor task of transcription is added.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What shape is it? Why do you think it is that shape?
- What job does this part do?
- What would happen if this part were a different shape?
- Can you find something else that does the same job?

**Secondary lens:** Perspective and Interpretation — Reading aloud with expression and evaluating own writing involves adopting the perspective of an audience — pupils ask 'how will this sound/read to someone else?', which is a perspectival shift.

---

## Session structure: Text Study

### Text Study
A reading-to-writing cycle for primary and KS3 English. Begins with shared or guided reading of a high-quality text, moves through analysis of language features and authorial choices, builds vocabulary, then scaffolds the writing process from planning through drafting to editing and publication.

`shared_reading` → `analysis` → `vocabulary` → `planning` → `drafting` → `editing`

**Assessment:** Final written outcome in the genre studied, demonstrating understanding of text features, appropriate vocabulary use, and effective application of the writing process.

**Teacher note:** Use the TEXT STUDY template: read a short, engaging text together, using pictures and expression to bring it alive. Help children point out interesting words and talk about what they mean. Guide them to say what happened in the story or what the text told them. Encourage them to have a go at their own simple piece of writing inspired by the text.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What happened in the story?
- Which was your favourite word? Why do you like it?
- How did the character feel? How do you know?
- Can you write your own sentence like the one we read?

---

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Non Fiction
**Features to teach:** title and subheadings, topic sentences, present tense for facts, labelled diagrams, simple glossary

**Writing outcome:** Write a simple non-chronological report (6-10 sentences) about an animal with a title, subheadings, factual sentences in present tense, and a labelled diagram

**Grammar focus:** present tense for facts, expanded noun phrases, commas in lists, subordination (because, when)
*(from Y2 Appendix 2)*

---

## Suggested texts

- **DK My First Animal Encyclopedia** by DK — Clear non-fiction layout with subheadings, diagrams, and facts
- **National Geographic Little Kids First Big Book of Animals** by Catherine D. Hughes — Accessible animal facts with excellent photographs

---

## Genre

- **Report:** Texts that present factual information organised by topic rather than chronologically. A core non-fiction form across KS1-KS3 that develops research, retrieval, and organisational skills. Cross-curricular by nature: report writing in English draws on content from Science, Geography, and History.
- **Information:** Reference texts organised for retrieval rather than continuous reading. Teaches pupils to use and create non-linear text features (contents, index, glossary, cross-references). Distinct from reports in that information texts are designed for dipping into rather than reading sequentially.

---

## Why this study matters

Non-chronological reports about animals are the standard entry point to information writing at KS1 because children are naturally interested in animals and already have background knowledge. The cross-curricular link to Science (living things, habitats) provides authentic content. The structured layout (title, subheadings, facts) teaches organisational skills transferable to all non-fiction writing.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Children copy facts verbatim from the source rather than putting them in their own words
2. Subheadings used decoratively rather than to organise information into categories
3. Present tense inconsistency (mixing 'Lions live in Africa' with 'The lion lived in a den')

---

## Cross-curricular opportunities

| Link | Subject | Connection | Strength |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| World Continents and Oceans | Geography | Where animals live in the world | Moderate |
| Using Technology: Creating Digital Content | Computing | Using digital tools for simple research | Moderate |

## Reading and writing skills (KS1)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Word meaning from context** — Understand the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in simple texts by using the surrounding context, including pictures and sentence sense, to make a reasonable guess at what the word means.
- **Information retrieval from simple texts** — Find and report specific information or key facts from a short piece of fiction or non-fiction, identifying the part of the text where the answer is located.
- **Retelling and sequencing** — Retell the main events of a story or the key steps in a non-fiction text, placing them in the correct order and identifying the most important ideas.
- **Simple inference from text** — Use clues in the text — characters' words, actions and feelings — to work out something the author has not stated directly, and begin to explain the reasoning behind that interpretation.
- **Prediction from text clues** — Predict what is likely to happen next in a story or sequence of events, drawing on what has already been read and on prior knowledge of similar texts and situations.
- **Noticing interesting words and phrases** — Identify and discuss words and phrases that capture attention or create an effect, beginning to explain what makes them interesting, surprising or effective in the context of the text.
