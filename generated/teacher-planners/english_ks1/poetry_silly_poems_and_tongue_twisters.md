## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **3 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Reciting poetry (EN-KS1-C021)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Learning and performing poems by heart with expression

**Teaching guidance:** Teach a range of poems by heart across KS1, beginning with simple nursery rhymes and action rhymes in Year 1 and progressing to poems with more complex patterns and vocabulary in Year 2. Use performance techniques — clapping rhythms, adding actions, varying volume and pace. Recite poems together as a class before asking individuals to perform. Choose poems with strong rhythm and rhyme to support memorisation, and discuss how the poet's word choices create effects.

**Key vocabulary:** poem, rhyme, rhythm, verse, line, perform, recite, by heart, learn, poet

**Common misconceptions:** Children sometimes think poetry must rhyme, limiting their appreciation of free verse. They may memorise words without understanding meaning, reciting mechanically without expression. Some children confuse reciting a poem with reading it aloud from a page.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Joining in with a familiar nursery rhyme or action rhyme as a group. | Join in as we say 'Humpty Dumpty' together. Do the actions as we go. | Mumbling or mouthing words without clearly speaking them; Doing the actions but not saying the words |
| **Developing** | Reciting a short, familiar poem from memory with some expression. | Say the poem 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star' by heart. Try to use expression. | Forgetting lines and needing prompts to continue; Reciting in a flat monotone without any expression |
| **Expected** | Reciting poems by heart with appropriate intonation, varying pace and volume for effect. | Perform the poem 'The Owl and the Pussycat' (first verse) to the class. Use your voice to bring the poem to life. | Reciting accurately but without varying tone or pace; Rushing through the poem to finish quickly |
| **Greater Depth** | Performing poems with deliberate use of voice and gesture, engaging the audience and showing understanding of meaning. | Choose a poem you have learned and perform it to the class. Explain why you chose the expression and actions you used. | Performing well but being unable to explain performance choices; Using gestures that distract from the words rather than enhancing meaning |

> **Model response (Entry):** *Child joins in with words and actions, following the group.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Child recites the poem accurately from memory with some variation in voice.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Child recites from memory with clear diction, appropriate pace, and expression that matches the poem's mood.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *Child performs with deliberate expression and gestures, then explains: 'I spoke quietly for the sad part and loudly for the exciting part because I wanted the audience to feel the change in mood.'*

### Secondary concept: Vocabulary development (EN-KS1-C019)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Learning and using new words in context

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Using picture cues and context to understand a new word encountered during shared reading. | Saying 'I don't know' without looking at the picture for help; Giving a vague synonym like 'big' without indicating degree |
| **Developing** | Working out the meaning of unfamiliar words using context and beginning to use new words in speech. | Defining the word but being unable to use it in a new sentence; Using the word incorrectly in the new sentence |
| **Expected** | Discussing the meaning and effect of vocabulary choices in texts, using strategies to work out unfamiliar words, and using new words in own writing. | Saying one word is 'better' without explaining why; Not recognising that 'danced' is used figuratively |
| **Greater Depth** | Collecting and categorising new vocabulary, understanding shades of meaning between synonyms, and choosing precise vocabulary in own writing. | Not distinguishing between similar words (e.g., treating 'terrified' and 'frightened' as identical); Ranking words based on how they sound rather than their meaning |

### Secondary concept: Literary language patterns (EN-KS1-C022)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Recognizing repetitive phrases, rhyme, and patterned language in stories and poems

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Joining in with repeated phrases or refrains during shared reading of patterned texts. | Not recognising when the repeated part is coming; Joining in too late, after the pattern has already been said |
| **Developing** | Recognising and identifying repeated phrases, rhyme and patterned language in stories and poems. | Noticing that words repeat but not being able to describe the pattern; Confusing rhyme with repetition |
| **Expected** | Recognising how authors use literary language patterns for effect, including repetition, rhyme, alliteration and formulaic phrases. | Identifying the pattern but not explaining its effect; Confusing alliteration with rhyme |
| **Greater Depth** | Using literary language patterns in own writing and explaining how they create effect, distinguishing literary language from everyday speech. | Using formulaic openings without understanding why they work; Not being able to articulate the difference between literary and everyday language |

### Secondary concept: Reading aloud with expression (EN-KS1-C051)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Performing own writing with appropriate intonation

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Reading own writing aloud to an adult, pointing to each word. | Reading what they think they wrote rather than what is on the page; Speaking too quietly to be heard |
| **Developing** | Reading own writing aloud to a partner clearly and audibly. | Reading too fast for the partner to follow; Mumbling or reading in a monotone |
| **Expected** | Reading own writing with appropriate intonation, pausing at punctuation and varying voice for effect. | Reading in a flat voice without expression; Adding expression for dialogue but reading narrative sections in monotone |
| **Greater Depth** | Performing own writing to the class with deliberate expression, engaging the audience and responding to their reactions. | Reading with good expression but not looking up at the audience; Over-performing so that the expression overwhelms the content |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Oral rehearsal is preparation for written composition — the function of speaking sentences aloud before writing is to make the structural demands of sentence composition explicit before the motor task of transcription is added.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What shape is it? Why do you think it is that shape?
- What job does this part do?
- What would happen if this part were a different shape?
- Can you find something else that does the same job?

**Secondary lens:** Perspective and Interpretation — Reading aloud with expression and evaluating own writing involves adopting the perspective of an audience — pupils ask 'how will this sound/read to someone else?', which is a perspectival shift.

---

## Session structure: Creative Response

### Creative Response
A creative arts or writing sequence that develops technique through exposure to exemplary work, guided exploration of techniques, structured planning, independent creation, and peer critique. Balances creative freedom with technical skill development.

`exemplar_exposure` → `technique_exploration` → `planning` → `creating` → `critique`

**Assessment:** Final creative outcome (artwork, design, written piece) accompanied by a reflective evaluation discussing techniques used, influences, and areas for development.

**Teacher note:** Use the CREATIVE RESPONSE template: show children examples of artwork or creative writing that inspire curiosity and excitement. Let them explore materials and techniques through play and experimentation. Support them in planning what they want to make, then give them time to create. Encourage them to talk about what they made and what they like about it.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What do you notice about this artwork or writing?
- What materials or colours will you use?
- Can you tell me about what you have made?
- What is your favourite part? Why?

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Poetry
**Features to teach:** alliteration, rhyme scheme, rhythm and syllable counting, word play and invented words, imagery

**Writing outcome:** Write at least 2 poems: one alliterative tongue twister and one rhyming poem using a pattern from a model, then perform one to the class

**Grammar focus:** alliteration (same initial sound), adjectives for description, exclamation marks for effect
*(from Y2 Appendix 2)*

**Literary terms:** alliteration, rhyme, rhythm, syllable, verse, poet, poem

---

## Suggested texts

- **Oi Frog!** by Kes Gray — Rhyming text with word play — can be used as poetry springboard
- **Poems to Perform** by Julia Donaldson — Curated for performance with actions and audience participation

---

## Genre

- **Poetry:** Literature using rhythm, imagery, and condensed language to convey meaning and emotion. Poetry is continuous across all key stages with no progression break, but expectations increase: from recitation and simple pattern-following (KS1) through multiple forms and figurative language (KS2) to analysis of poetic conventions and unseen poetry comparison (KS4).

---

## Why this study matters

Y2 poetry builds on Y1 recitation by introducing alliteration and more varied forms. Silly poems and tongue twisters engage reluctant writers because the emphasis is on word play and sound rather than narrative coherence. Alliteration develops phonological awareness and vocabulary simultaneously. The performance element fulfils the statutory spoken language requirement.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Alliterative poems become lists of words rather than meaningful sentences
2. Performance is flat group recitation rather than individual expressive delivery
3. Children struggle with rhyme because they have not heard enough rhyming poetry read aloud

---

## Cross-curricular opportunities

| Link | Subject | Connection | Strength |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| Hands, Feet, Heart | Music | Rhythm in poetry — clapping syllables, adding musical accompaniment | Strong |

## Reading and writing skills (KS1)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Word meaning from context** — Understand the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in simple texts by using the surrounding context, including pictures and sentence sense, to make a reasonable guess at what the word means.
- **Information retrieval from simple texts** — Find and report specific information or key facts from a short piece of fiction or non-fiction, identifying the part of the text where the answer is located.
- **Retelling and sequencing** — Retell the main events of a story or the key steps in a non-fiction text, placing them in the correct order and identifying the most important ideas.
- **Simple inference from text** — Use clues in the text — characters' words, actions and feelings — to work out something the author has not stated directly, and begin to explain the reasoning behind that interpretation.
- **Prediction from text clues** — Predict what is likely to happen next in a story or sequence of events, drawing on what has already been read and on prior knowledge of similar texts and situations.
- **Noticing interesting words and phrases** — Identify and discuss words and phrases that capture attention or create an effect, beginning to explain what makes them interesting, surprising or effective in the context of the text.
