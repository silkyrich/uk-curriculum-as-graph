## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Narrative sequencing (EN-KS1-C045)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Ordering sentences to create a coherent story

**Teaching guidance:** Teach narrative sequencing by modelling how to write short stories or recounts in chronological order. Use time connectives (first, then, next, after that, finally) to structure the sequence. Provide picture prompts or story maps that children follow when writing. Start with retelling familiar stories before moving to original narratives. In Year 1, aim for 3-4 sequenced sentences; in Year 2, extend to 6-8 sentences with clear beginning, middle and end.

**Key vocabulary:** first, then, next, after, finally, beginning, middle, end, in order, story, what happened

**Common misconceptions:** Children often write narratives that are heavily front-loaded, with extensive detail about the beginning and very little about the middle or end. They may use 'and then' repeatedly instead of varying connectives. Some children struggle to maintain a consistent narrative thread, introducing unrelated events.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Writing two or three sentences about the same topic in order, with picture support. | Write three sentences about what happens in the pictures: (picture 1: boy wakes up, picture 2: boy eats breakfast, picture 3: boy goes to school). | Writing sentences about different, unrelated topics; Describing only one picture and not sequencing |
| **Developing** | Writing a short narrative in order using time connectives (first, then, next, finally). | Write a four-sentence story about a trip to the zoo. Use the words first, then, next, finally. | Using the same connective ('then') for every sentence; Putting events in an illogical order |
| **Expected** | Writing a short narrative with a clear beginning, middle and end, maintaining a coherent sequence of events. | Write a short story about a character who finds something unexpected. Make sure it has a beginning, middle and end. | Writing a detailed beginning but rushing or omitting the ending; Events that don't connect logically to each other |
| **Greater Depth** | Writing narratives with a developed plot including a problem and resolution, using varied connectives and building tension. | Write a story about a character facing a problem. Build up to the most exciting part before showing how the problem is solved. | Including a problem but resolving it too quickly without building tension; Losing the narrative thread partway through and introducing unrelated events |

> **Model response (Entry):** *'The boy woke up. He had cereal for breakfast. Then he walked to school.'*

> **Model response (Developing):** *'First, we got on the bus. Then, we arrived at the zoo. Next, we saw the lions and monkeys. Finally, we had ice cream and went home.'*

> **Model response (Expected):** *'One sunny morning, Lily found a golden key in her garden. She tried it in every lock she could find, but none of them opened. Finally, she tried the old shed door — it opened to reveal a beautiful secret garden inside.'*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *Child writes a narrative with character introduction, rising tension, a climax and a satisfying resolution, using varied time and causal connectives, and with dialogue or description adding interest.*

### Secondary concept: Planning writing (EN-KS1-C048)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Thinking ahead and organizing ideas before writing

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Telling an adult what they are going to write about before beginning. | Saying 'I don't know' and wanting to start writing immediately; Giving only a single word topic rather than an idea for the content |
| **Developing** | Using a simple plan (picture, list or story map) before writing, with teacher guidance. | Creating a detailed drawing rather than a quick planning aid; Planning but then ignoring the plan when writing |
| **Expected** | Planning independently using an appropriate method (list, boxing up, mind map) before writing, and following the plan. | Spending too long on the plan so it becomes a first draft; Planning the beginning in detail but not planning the middle or end |
| **Greater Depth** | Planning with awareness of audience and purpose, including key vocabulary and structural choices. | Planning content but not considering the persuasive structure; Not including vocabulary or language feature notes in the plan |

### Secondary concept: Subordination (EN-KS1-C063)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Using when, if, that, or because to join clauses

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Joining two ideas using 'because' to give a reason, with oral practice. | Giving a reason that doesn't logically follow ('I wore my coat because I like cats'); Repeating the first part instead of adding a reason |
| **Developing** | Using 'when', 'if', 'that' and 'because' to join a main clause and subordinate clause in writing. | Writing the subordinate clause as a complete sentence: 'Because it was raining.' (fragment); Using the conjunction but not completing the sentence |
| **Expected** | Using subordination with 'when', 'if', 'that' and 'because' accurately in writing, varying the position of the subordinate clause. | Always putting the subordinate clause in the same position; Confusing subordination with coordination (using 'because' as if it means 'and') |
| **Greater Depth** | Choosing between conjunctions for precise meaning and explaining why one is better than another in context. | Treating 'if' and 'when' as interchangeable; Choosing correctly but not being able to explain the difference in meaning |

### Secondary concept: Co-ordination (EN-KS1-C064)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Using or, and, or but to join clauses equally

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Using 'and' to join two equally important ideas in a sentence. | Writing both as separate sentences without joining; Using 'and' at the start: 'And I like cats' |
| **Developing** | Using 'and', 'but' and 'or' to join clauses, understanding the different meaning each adds. | Choosing 'and' for every sentence regardless of meaning; Not understanding that 'but' signals contrast |
| **Expected** | Using all four coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or, so) correctly in own writing. | Using 'so' and 'because' interchangeably without understanding the difference; Starting sentences with 'but' or 'so' instead of using them to join clauses |
| **Greater Depth** | Explaining the difference between coordination and subordination and choosing between them for effect. | Seeing both sentences as identical in meaning and emphasis; Not understanding that word order and conjunction choice affect emphasis |

### Secondary concept: Commas in lists (EN-KS1-C065)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Using commas to separate items in a list

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Understanding that commas separate items when listing more than two things. | Not noticing the commas at all; Thinking commas are the same as full stops |
| **Developing** | Using commas to separate items in a list of three or more, with 'and' before the final item. | Using 'and' between every item instead of commas; Placing commas after every item including before 'and' |
| **Expected** | Using commas in lists consistently and correctly in independent writing, including lists of adjectives, nouns and verbs. | Using commas in noun lists but forgetting them in adjective or verb lists; Placing commas randomly rather than between each item |
| **Greater Depth** | Understanding that commas in lists prevent ambiguity and can change meaning. | Not seeing the ambiguity in the uncomma'd version; Understanding the joke but not connecting it to the function of commas |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Oral rehearsal is preparation for written composition — the function of speaking sentences aloud before writing is to make the structural demands of sentence composition explicit before the motor task of transcription is added.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What shape is it? Why do you think it is that shape?
- What job does this part do?
- What would happen if this part were a different shape?
- Can you find something else that does the same job?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Evaluating and proof-reading require pupils to read their own writing as a text to be assessed — they use the evidence of what they have written to judge whether it meets the criteria of sense, accuracy and effect.

---

## Session structure: Text Study

### Text Study
A reading-to-writing cycle for primary and KS3 English. Begins with shared or guided reading of a high-quality text, moves through analysis of language features and authorial choices, builds vocabulary, then scaffolds the writing process from planning through drafting to editing and publication.

`shared_reading` → `analysis` → `vocabulary` → `planning` → `drafting` → `editing`

**Assessment:** Final written outcome in the genre studied, demonstrating understanding of text features, appropriate vocabulary use, and effective application of the writing process.

**Teacher note:** Use the TEXT STUDY template: read a short, engaging text together, using pictures and expression to bring it alive. Help children point out interesting words and talk about what they mean. Guide them to say what happened in the story or what the text told them. Encourage them to have a go at their own simple piece of writing inspired by the text.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What happened in the story?
- Which was your favourite word? Why do you like it?
- How did the character feel? How do you know?
- Can you write your own sentence like the one we read?

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Fiction
**Features to teach:** cumulative structure (adding characters one by one), repetition with variation, teamwork and cooperation theme, writing from a different character's perspective

**Writing outcome:** Write own cumulative story (10-15 sentences) with a repeated pattern and at least 4 characters, using co-ordination and subordination

**Grammar focus:** co-ordination (and, but, or), subordination (when, if, that, because), past tense consistency, commas in lists
*(from Y2 Appendix 2)*

**Literary terms:** character, setting, pattern, repetition, perspective

---

## Suggested texts

- **The Enormous Turnip** by Traditional (Aleksei Tolstoy version) — Classic cumulative structure with clear pattern for innovating
- **Handa's Surprise** by Eileen Browne — Alternative cumulative text with multicultural setting

---

## Genre

- **Narrative:** Extended prose fiction with characters, setting, and a plot driven by conflict and resolution. The dominant literary form across all key stages, progressing from simple retelling (KS1) through structured narrative (KS2) to literary fiction with controlled voice and style (KS3-KS4).
- **Traditional Tale:** Stories passed down through oral tradition with archetypal characters, repetitive structures, and moral lessons. The entry point to narrative for KS1 children because the familiar structures scaffold retelling and independent composition. Includes fairy tales, myths, legends, fables, and folk tales.

---

## Why this study matters

The Enormous Turnip extends traditional tale study at Y2 by introducing a cumulative structure (each new character joins the pulling chain). This pattern is highly scaffolded — children see the formula, internalise it, and can innovate by changing the object, setting, or characters. It also introduces writing from a different character's perspective, a Y2 composition skill.

---

## Sequencing

**Follows:** Narrative: Dogger

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Innovation is too close to the original (just changing character names)
2. Cumulative pattern abandoned halfway through, reverting to linear narrative
3. Subordination used only in teacher-modelled sentences, not in independent writing

---

## Reading and writing skills (KS1)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Word meaning from context** — Understand the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in simple texts by using the surrounding context, including pictures and sentence sense, to make a reasonable guess at what the word means.
- **Information retrieval from simple texts** — Find and report specific information or key facts from a short piece of fiction or non-fiction, identifying the part of the text where the answer is located.
- **Retelling and sequencing** — Retell the main events of a story or the key steps in a non-fiction text, placing them in the correct order and identifying the most important ideas.
- **Simple inference from text** — Use clues in the text — characters' words, actions and feelings — to work out something the author has not stated directly, and begin to explain the reasoning behind that interpretation.
- **Prediction from text clues** — Predict what is likely to happen next in a story or sequence of events, drawing on what has already been read and on prior knowledge of similar texts and situations.
- **Noticing interesting words and phrases** — Identify and discuss words and phrases that capture attention or create an effect, beginning to explain what makes them interesting, surprising or effective in the context of the text.
