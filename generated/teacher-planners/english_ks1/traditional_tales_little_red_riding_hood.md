## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Narrative sequencing (EN-KS1-C045)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Ordering sentences to create a coherent story

**Teaching guidance:** Teach narrative sequencing by modelling how to write short stories or recounts in chronological order. Use time connectives (first, then, next, after that, finally) to structure the sequence. Provide picture prompts or story maps that children follow when writing. Start with retelling familiar stories before moving to original narratives. In Year 1, aim for 3-4 sequenced sentences; in Year 2, extend to 6-8 sentences with clear beginning, middle and end.

**Key vocabulary:** first, then, next, after, finally, beginning, middle, end, in order, story, what happened

**Common misconceptions:** Children often write narratives that are heavily front-loaded, with extensive detail about the beginning and very little about the middle or end. They may use 'and then' repeatedly instead of varying connectives. Some children struggle to maintain a consistent narrative thread, introducing unrelated events.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Writing two or three sentences about the same topic in order, with picture support. | Write three sentences about what happens in the pictures: (picture 1: boy wakes up, picture 2: boy eats breakfast, picture 3: boy goes to school). | Writing sentences about different, unrelated topics; Describing only one picture and not sequencing |
| **Developing** | Writing a short narrative in order using time connectives (first, then, next, finally). | Write a four-sentence story about a trip to the zoo. Use the words first, then, next, finally. | Using the same connective ('then') for every sentence; Putting events in an illogical order |
| **Expected** | Writing a short narrative with a clear beginning, middle and end, maintaining a coherent sequence of events. | Write a short story about a character who finds something unexpected. Make sure it has a beginning, middle and end. | Writing a detailed beginning but rushing or omitting the ending; Events that don't connect logically to each other |
| **Greater Depth** | Writing narratives with a developed plot including a problem and resolution, using varied connectives and building tension. | Write a story about a character facing a problem. Build up to the most exciting part before showing how the problem is solved. | Including a problem but resolving it too quickly without building tension; Losing the narrative thread partway through and introducing unrelated events |

> **Model response (Entry):** *'The boy woke up. He had cereal for breakfast. Then he walked to school.'*

> **Model response (Developing):** *'First, we got on the bus. Then, we arrived at the zoo. Next, we saw the lions and monkeys. Finally, we had ice cream and went home.'*

> **Model response (Expected):** *'One sunny morning, Lily found a golden key in her garden. She tried it in every lock she could find, but none of them opened. Finally, she tried the old shed door — it opened to reveal a beautiful secret garden inside.'*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *Child writes a narrative with character introduction, rising tension, a climax and a satisfying resolution, using varied time and causal connectives, and with dialogue or description adding interest.*

### Secondary concept: Sentence composition (EN-KS1-C044)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Creating complete, meaningful sentences

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Writing a simple sentence with a subject and verb that communicates one idea, with scaffold support. | Writing a phrase rather than a complete sentence (e.g., 'big dog'); Not including a verb ('The dog brown.') |
| **Developing** | Writing simple sentences independently with a capital letter and full stop, adding some detail. | Forgetting the capital letter or full stop; Writing a sentence that is very short and lacks detail |
| **Expected** | Writing varied sentences including compound sentences using 'and', 'but', 'or', 'so' and beginning to use subordination. | Using 'and' for every compound sentence instead of varying conjunctions; Writing a fragment after the conjunction ('Because it was raining.') |
| **Greater Depth** | Writing varied sentence types with deliberate choices about length, structure and word order for effect. | Writing all sentences with the same structure and length; Varying structure but losing grammatical accuracy |

### Secondary concept: Writing for different purposes (EN-KS1-C047)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Adapting writing for different text types (narrative, recount, poetry)

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Writing for a single familiar purpose (e.g., a story or a label) with adult support. | Writing without awareness of the purpose (e.g., writing a story when a label was requested); Not distinguishing between different types of writing |
| **Developing** | Writing for two or three different purposes (narrative, recount, list) with some awareness that each requires different features. | Writing in narrative form ('First I got the bread and then I put butter on it') instead of instruction form; Including imperative verbs but forgetting to number or sequence the steps |
| **Expected** | Writing for a range of purposes — narrative, recount, instruction, information, letter, poetry — using features appropriate to each text type. | Writing a recount without the letter format (no greeting or sign-off); Mixing up the features of different text types |
| **Greater Depth** | Adapting writing style and language for different purposes and audiences, explaining why different text types need different features. | Writing both pieces in the same style; Explaining that they are different but not articulating how or why |

### Secondary concept: Exclamation marks (EN-KS1-C056)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Using exclamation marks to show strong feeling

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recognising that exclamation marks show strong feeling, and reading exclamatory sentences with expression. | Reading both sentences in the same tone; Not connecting the exclamation mark to a change in expression |
| **Developing** | Using exclamation marks in own writing for sentences showing strong feelings. | Putting an exclamation mark after a statement that doesn't show strong feeling; Using multiple exclamation marks (!!!) for extra emphasis |
| **Expected** | Using exclamation marks appropriately for exclamations and commands, not overusing them. | Using exclamation marks after ordinary statements; Not knowing that exclamation sentences begin with 'What' or 'How' |
| **Greater Depth** | Explaining the grammatical form of an exclamation sentence and choosing deliberately between full stops, question marks and exclamation marks for effect. | Thinking any sentence ending in '!' is an exclamation sentence; Not understanding the specific grammatical structure required |

### Secondary concept: Drama and role-play (EN-KS1-C077)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Taking on roles to explore characters and situations

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Participating in simple role-play activities linked to stories or experiences, with adult modelling. | Breaking out of role immediately; Not speaking in character, only performing actions |
| **Developing** | Taking on a role in a structured drama activity, speaking and acting as the character. | Answering as themselves rather than in character; Giving one-word answers without developing the character's voice |
| **Expected** | Using drama to explore characters and situations, sustaining a role and responding to others in character. | Breaking character to discuss what to do next rather than improvising in role; Speaking as themselves rather than as the character |
| **Greater Depth** | Using drama to deepen understanding of characters and texts, reflecting on how performing a role changed their understanding. | Saying the drama was fun without reflecting on what it taught them; Not connecting the drama experience to deeper understanding of the text |

---

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Oral rehearsal is preparation for written composition — the function of speaking sentences aloud before writing is to make the structural demands of sentence composition explicit before the motor task of transcription is added.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What shape is it? Why do you think it is that shape?
- What job does this part do?
- What would happen if this part were a different shape?
- Can you find something else that does the same job?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Evaluating and proof-reading require pupils to read their own writing as a text to be assessed — they use the evidence of what they have written to judge whether it meets the criteria of sense, accuracy and effect.

---

## Session structure: Text Study

### Text Study
A reading-to-writing cycle for primary and KS3 English. Begins with shared or guided reading of a high-quality text, moves through analysis of language features and authorial choices, builds vocabulary, then scaffolds the writing process from planning through drafting to editing and publication.

`shared_reading` → `analysis` → `vocabulary` → `planning` → `drafting` → `editing`

**Assessment:** Final written outcome in the genre studied, demonstrating understanding of text features, appropriate vocabulary use, and effective application of the writing process.

**Teacher note:** Use the TEXT STUDY template: read a short, engaging text together, using pictures and expression to bring it alive. Help children point out interesting words and talk about what they mean. Guide them to say what happened in the story or what the text told them. Encourage them to have a go at their own simple piece of writing inspired by the text.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What happened in the story?
- Which was your favourite word? Why do you like it?
- How did the character feel? How do you know?
- Can you write your own sentence like the one we read?

---

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Fiction
**Features to teach:** character descriptions (big bad wolf, little girl), direct speech pattern (What big eyes you have!), danger and rescue structure, moral lesson (do not talk to strangers)

**Writing outcome:** Write own version of a familiar story changing one element (character, setting or ending) in 5-8 sentences

**Grammar focus:** capital letters and full stops, exclamation marks, joining words (and, but)
*(from Y1 Appendix 2)*

**Literary terms:** character, setting, moral, villain, hero

---

## Suggested texts

- **Little Red Riding Hood** by Traditional (various illustrators) — Use alongside a modern retelling for comparison
- **Little Red** by Bethan Woollvin — Modern feminist retelling — strong female protagonist

---

## Genre

- **Traditional Tale:** Stories passed down through oral tradition with archetypal characters, repetitive structures, and moral lessons. The entry point to narrative for KS1 children because the familiar structures scaffold retelling and independent composition. Includes fairy tales, myths, legends, fables, and folk tales.

---

## Why this study matters

Building on the first traditional tale unit, this unit introduces changing one story element as a scaffold to independent composition. Y1 children can manage changing the setting, the character, or the ending while retaining the familiar structure. The dialogue pattern (What big X you have!) is highly memorable and supports early speech punctuation awareness.

## Sequencing

**Follows:** Traditional Tales: The Three Billy Goats Gruff

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils copy the original rather than innovating their own version
2. Character change is superficial (just changing the name) rather than meaningful
3. Drama work does not feed into the writing task

---

## Reading and writing skills (KS1)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Word meaning from context** — Understand the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in simple texts by using the surrounding context, including pictures and sentence sense, to make a reasonable guess at what the word means.
- **Information retrieval from simple texts** — Find and report specific information or key facts from a short piece of fiction or non-fiction, identifying the part of the text where the answer is located.
- **Retelling and sequencing** — Retell the main events of a story or the key steps in a non-fiction text, placing them in the correct order and identifying the most important ideas.
- **Simple inference from text** — Use clues in the text — characters' words, actions and feelings — to work out something the author has not stated directly, and begin to explain the reasoning behind that interpretation.
- **Prediction from text clues** — Predict what is likely to happen next in a story or sequence of events, drawing on what has already been read and on prior knowledge of similar texts and situations.
- **Noticing interesting words and phrases** — Identify and discuss words and phrases that capture attention or create an effect, beginning to explain what makes them interesting, surprising or effective in the context of the text.
