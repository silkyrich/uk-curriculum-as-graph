## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **6 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Narrative sequencing (EN-KS1-C045)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Ordering sentences to create a coherent story

**Teaching guidance:** Teach narrative sequencing by modelling how to write short stories or recounts in chronological order. Use time connectives (first, then, next, after that, finally) to structure the sequence. Provide picture prompts or story maps that children follow when writing. Start with retelling familiar stories before moving to original narratives. In Year 1, aim for 3-4 sequenced sentences; in Year 2, extend to 6-8 sentences with clear beginning, middle and end.

**Key vocabulary:** first, then, next, after, finally, beginning, middle, end, in order, story, what happened

**Common misconceptions:** Children often write narratives that are heavily front-loaded, with extensive detail about the beginning and very little about the middle or end. They may use 'and then' repeatedly instead of varying connectives. Some children struggle to maintain a consistent narrative thread, introducing unrelated events.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Writing two or three sentences about the same topic in order, with picture support. | Write three sentences about what happens in the pictures: (picture 1: boy wakes up, picture 2: boy eats breakfast, picture 3: boy goes to school). | Writing sentences about different, unrelated topics; Describing only one picture and not sequencing |
| **Developing** | Writing a short narrative in order using time connectives (first, then, next, finally). | Write a four-sentence story about a trip to the zoo. Use the words first, then, next, finally. | Using the same connective ('then') for every sentence; Putting events in an illogical order |
| **Expected** | Writing a short narrative with a clear beginning, middle and end, maintaining a coherent sequence of events. | Write a short story about a character who finds something unexpected. Make sure it has a beginning, middle and end. | Writing a detailed beginning but rushing or omitting the ending; Events that don't connect logically to each other |
| **Greater Depth** | Writing narratives with a developed plot including a problem and resolution, using varied connectives and building tension. | Write a story about a character facing a problem. Build up to the most exciting part before showing how the problem is solved. | Including a problem but resolving it too quickly without building tension; Losing the narrative thread partway through and introducing unrelated events |

> **Model response (Entry):** *'The boy woke up. He had cereal for breakfast. Then he walked to school.'*

> **Model response (Developing):** *'First, we got on the bus. Then, we arrived at the zoo. Next, we saw the lions and monkeys. Finally, we had ice cream and went home.'*

> **Model response (Expected):** *'One sunny morning, Lily found a golden key in her garden. She tried it in every lock she could find, but none of them opened. Finally, she tried the old shed door — it opened to reveal a beautiful secret garden inside.'*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *Child writes a narrative with character introduction, rising tension, a climax and a satisfying resolution, using varied time and causal connectives, and with dialogue or description adding interest.*

- **Story structure** (EN-KS1-C018): Understanding narrative elements: beginning, middle, end, characters, setting, events
- **Oral rehearsal** (EN-KS1-C043): Saying sentences out loud before writing them down
- **Sentence composition** (EN-KS1-C044): Creating complete, meaningful sentences
- **Sentence boundaries** (EN-KS1-C052): Understanding where sentences begin and end
- **Capital letters for sentence starts** (EN-KS1-C053): Using capital letters to begin sentences
- **Full stops** (EN-KS1-C054): Using full stops to end statements
---

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Oral rehearsal is preparation for written composition — the function of speaking sentences aloud before writing is to make the structural demands of sentence composition explicit before the motor task of transcription is added.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What shape is it? Why do you think it is that shape?
- What job does this part do?
- What would happen if this part were a different shape?
- Can you find something else that does the same job?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Evaluating and proof-reading require pupils to read their own writing as a text to be assessed — they use the evidence of what they have written to judge whether it meets the criteria of sense, accuracy and effect.

## Session structure: Text Study

### Text Study
A reading-to-writing cycle for primary and KS3 English. Begins with shared or guided reading of a high-quality text, moves through analysis of language features and authorial choices, builds vocabulary, then scaffolds the writing process from planning through drafting to editing and publication.

`shared_reading` → `analysis` → `vocabulary` → `planning` → `drafting` → `editing`

**Assessment:** Final written outcome in the genre studied, demonstrating understanding of text features, appropriate vocabulary use, and effective application of the writing process.

**Teacher note:** Use the TEXT STUDY template: read a short, engaging text together, using pictures and expression to bring it alive. Help children point out interesting words and talk about what they mean. Guide them to say what happened in the story or what the text told them. Encourage them to have a go at their own simple piece of writing inspired by the text.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What happened in the story?
- Which was your favourite word? Why do you like it?
- How did the character feel? How do you know?
- Can you write your own sentence like the one we read?

---

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Fiction
**Features to teach:** repeated refrain (Trip, trap, trip, trap), rule of three (three goats, three attempts), good versus evil (goats versus troll), beginning, middle, end structure

**Writing outcome:** Retell the story in 4-6 sentences using the repeated refrain and sequencing words (first, then, next, finally)

**Grammar focus:** joining words (and), sequencing words (first, then, next), capital letters and full stops
*(from Y1 Appendix 2)*

**Literary terms:** character, setting, beginning, middle, end

---

## Suggested texts

- **The Three Billy Goats Gruff** by Traditional (various illustrators) — Use a version with clear, large illustrations for shared reading

---

## Genre

- **Traditional Tale:** Stories passed down through oral tradition with archetypal characters, repetitive structures, and moral lessons. The entry point to narrative for KS1 children because the familiar structures scaffold retelling and independent composition. Includes fairy tales, myths, legends, fables, and folk tales.

---

## Why this study matters

Traditional tales are the entry point to narrative at KS1. The Three Billy Goats Gruff is ideal for Y1 because its repetitive structure, limited cast, and clear conflict support oral retelling before written retelling. The rule of three provides a scaffolding structure that Y1 children can internalise and replicate.

## Sequencing

**Leads to:** Traditional Tales: Little Red Riding Hood

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Spending too long on drama and retelling without moving to written output
2. Not explicitly teaching the story structure (beginning, middle, end) as a transferable pattern
3. Writing task too ambitious for Y1 — keep to 4-6 sentences

---

## Reading and writing skills (KS1)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Word meaning from context** — Understand the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in simple texts by using the surrounding context, including pictures and sentence sense, to make a reasonable guess at what the word means.
- **Information retrieval from simple texts** — Find and report specific information or key facts from a short piece of fiction or non-fiction, identifying the part of the text where the answer is located.
- **Retelling and sequencing** — Retell the main events of a story or the key steps in a non-fiction text, placing them in the correct order and identifying the most important ideas.
- **Simple inference from text** — Use clues in the text — characters' words, actions and feelings — to work out something the author has not stated directly, and begin to explain the reasoning behind that interpretation.
- **Prediction from text clues** — Predict what is likely to happen next in a story or sequence of events, drawing on what has already been read and on prior knowledge of similar texts and situations.
- **Noticing interesting words and phrases** — Identify and discuss words and phrases that capture attention or create an effect, beginning to explain what makes them interesting, surprising or effective in the context of the text.
