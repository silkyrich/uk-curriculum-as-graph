## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **3 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Writing for different purposes (EN-KS1-C047)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Adapting writing for different text types (narrative, recount, poetry)

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce different text types through reading before asking children to write them. Cover key purposes: narrative (stories), recount (retelling events), instruction (how to do something), information (facts about a topic), letters, and poetry. Discuss the features of each text type explicitly: 'Instructions use numbered steps and bossy verbs.' Provide model texts and writing frames to scaffold early attempts. Ensure children understand that the purpose of writing determines its form and language choices.

**Key vocabulary:** purpose, story, recount, instructions, information, letter, poem, audience, text type, for

**Common misconceptions:** Children may default to narrative structure for all writing, including instructions and information texts. They may not understand that different purposes require different language features (e.g., imperative verbs in instructions, past tense in recounts). Some children focus on content without considering who they are writing for.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Writing for a single familiar purpose (e.g., a story or a label) with adult support. | Write a sentence to go with this picture of a farm. You are writing a label to tell people about it. | Writing without awareness of the purpose (e.g., writing a story when a label was requested); Not distinguishing between different types of writing |
| **Developing** | Writing for two or three different purposes (narrative, recount, list) with some awareness that each requires different features. | Write instructions for making a sandwich. Remember to use bossy verbs and number the steps. | Writing in narrative form ('First I got the bread and then I put butter on it') instead of instruction form; Including imperative verbs but forgetting to number or sequence the steps |
| **Expected** | Writing for a range of purposes — narrative, recount, instruction, information, letter, poetry — using features appropriate to each text type. | Write a letter to a friend telling them about a trip you went on. Use the correct letter layout. | Writing a recount without the letter format (no greeting or sign-off); Mixing up the features of different text types |
| **Greater Depth** | Adapting writing style and language for different purposes and audiences, explaining why different text types need different features. | Write about the school trip twice: once as a recount for your diary and once as a report for the school newsletter. How are they different? | Writing both pieces in the same style; Explaining that they are different but not articulating how or why |

> **Model response (Entry):** *'This is a farm with cows and sheep.'*

> **Model response (Developing):** *'1. Get two slices of bread. 2. Spread butter on both slices. 3. Add cheese. 4. Put the slices together.'*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Child writes with a greeting, recounts the trip in past tense with personal detail, and ends with a sign-off.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *Diary: 'Today was the best day ever! We went to the museum and I saw a real dinosaur skeleton.' Newsletter: 'Year 2 visited the Natural History Museum on Tuesday. The children particularly enjoyed the dinosaur exhibition.' 'The diary is personal and uses I/we. The newsletter is formal and written for parents.'*

### Secondary concept: Evaluating own writing (EN-KS1-C049)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Assessing effectiveness of writing with teacher and peers

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying something they like about their own writing when asked by the teacher. | Saying 'I don't know' or 'nothing'; Commenting only on neatness rather than content |
| **Developing** | Identifying a strength and suggesting one improvement to their own writing using a simple checklist. | Ticking everything on the checklist without careful checking; Identifying that something is missing but not knowing how to improve it |
| **Expected** | Evaluating own and peers' writing against success criteria, giving specific feedback including suggestions for improvement. | Giving vague praise ('It was good') rather than specific feedback; Being unable to suggest a specific improvement |
| **Greater Depth** | Evaluating writing for its effect on the reader, suggesting how to strengthen weak sections, and applying feedback to improve own work. | Identifying the strongest part but not the weakest; Suggesting an improvement but not being able to carry it out |

### Secondary concept: Present and past tense (EN-KS1-C061)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Using correct verb forms to indicate when something happens

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Using the present tense to describe what is happening now, with oral practice. | Using past tense ('The boy was running') when the picture shows current action; Omitting the auxiliary verb ('The boy running') |
| **Developing** | Using regular past tense -ed forms in recounts and narratives. | Switching between past and present tense in the same piece; Over-generalising -ed to irregular verbs: 'I goed', 'I runned' |
| **Expected** | Using present and past tense consistently and correctly, including common irregular past tense forms. | Using 'goed' instead of 'went' or 'seed' instead of 'saw'; Correctly converting some verbs but not others |
| **Greater Depth** | Maintaining consistent tense throughout an extended piece and explaining why tense shifts should be deliberate. | Identifying obvious tense shifts but missing subtle ones; Fixing the shift but not explaining why consistency matters |

### Secondary concept: Subordination (EN-KS1-C063)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Using when, if, that, or because to join clauses

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Joining two ideas using 'because' to give a reason, with oral practice. | Giving a reason that doesn't logically follow ('I wore my coat because I like cats'); Repeating the first part instead of adding a reason |
| **Developing** | Using 'when', 'if', 'that' and 'because' to join a main clause and subordinate clause in writing. | Writing the subordinate clause as a complete sentence: 'Because it was raining.' (fragment); Using the conjunction but not completing the sentence |
| **Expected** | Using subordination with 'when', 'if', 'that' and 'because' accurately in writing, varying the position of the subordinate clause. | Always putting the subordinate clause in the same position; Confusing subordination with coordination (using 'because' as if it means 'and') |
| **Greater Depth** | Choosing between conjunctions for precise meaning and explaining why one is better than another in context. | Treating 'if' and 'when' as interchangeable; Choosing correctly but not being able to explain the difference in meaning |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Oral rehearsal is preparation for written composition — the function of speaking sentences aloud before writing is to make the structural demands of sentence composition explicit before the motor task of transcription is added.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What shape is it? Why do you think it is that shape?
- What job does this part do?
- What would happen if this part were a different shape?
- Can you find something else that does the same job?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Evaluating and proof-reading require pupils to read their own writing as a text to be assessed — they use the evidence of what they have written to judge whether it meets the criteria of sense, accuracy and effect.

---

## Session structure: Text Study

### Text Study
A reading-to-writing cycle for primary and KS3 English. Begins with shared or guided reading of a high-quality text, moves through analysis of language features and authorial choices, builds vocabulary, then scaffolds the writing process from planning through drafting to editing and publication.

`shared_reading` → `analysis` → `vocabulary` → `planning` → `drafting` → `editing`

**Assessment:** Final written outcome in the genre studied, demonstrating understanding of text features, appropriate vocabulary use, and effective application of the writing process.

**Teacher note:** Use the TEXT STUDY template: read a short, engaging text together, using pictures and expression to bring it alive. Help children point out interesting words and talk about what they mean. Guide them to say what happened in the story or what the text told them. Encourage them to have a go at their own simple piece of writing inspired by the text.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What happened in the story?
- Which was your favourite word? Why do you like it?
- How did the character feel? How do you know?
- Can you write your own sentence like the one we read?

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Non Fiction
**Features to teach:** diary format (Dear Diary, date, first person), past tense, personal voice and opinion, chronological order with time phrases

**Writing outcome:** Write a diary entry (8-12 sentences) from a character's perspective using first person, past tense, diary conventions, and personal opinion

**Grammar focus:** first person (I, my, we), past tense, exclamation marks for strong feelings, subordination (because, when)
*(from Y2 Appendix 2)*

**Literary terms:** first person, narrator, perspective, voice

---

## Suggested texts

- **The Diary of a Killer Cat** by Anne Fine — Hilarious diary from the cat's perspective — ideal for modelling voice and opinion in recount
- **Diary of a Wombat** by Jackie French — Simpler diary format for lower-ability scaffold

---

## Genre

- **Recount:** Texts that retell events in chronological order with specific detail. The simplest non-fiction form at KS1, progressing from 'what I did at the weekend' personal recounts to historical recounts, diary entries from characters' perspectives, and biographical writing at KS2. Develops into literary non-fiction at KS3-KS4.

---

## Why this study matters

Diary writing from a character's perspective bridges fiction and non-fiction: it uses recount conventions (chronological, past tense, time phrases) but requires imagination (adopting the character's voice and viewpoint). The Diary of a Killer Cat provides a strong, humorous model of personal voice that Y2 children can emulate. This prepares pupils for writing in role at KS2.

---

## Sequencing

**Follows:** Recount: My Weekend

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Diary entry reads as a flat recount without personal voice or opinion
2. Children write as themselves rather than staying in character
3. Time phrases (first, then, next) used mechanically without varying openings

---

## Reading and writing skills (KS1)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Word meaning from context** — Understand the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in simple texts by using the surrounding context, including pictures and sentence sense, to make a reasonable guess at what the word means.
- **Information retrieval from simple texts** — Find and report specific information or key facts from a short piece of fiction or non-fiction, identifying the part of the text where the answer is located.
- **Retelling and sequencing** — Retell the main events of a story or the key steps in a non-fiction text, placing them in the correct order and identifying the most important ideas.
- **Simple inference from text** — Use clues in the text — characters' words, actions and feelings — to work out something the author has not stated directly, and begin to explain the reasoning behind that interpretation.
- **Prediction from text clues** — Predict what is likely to happen next in a story or sequence of events, drawing on what has already been read and on prior knowledge of similar texts and situations.
- **Noticing interesting words and phrases** — Identify and discuss words and phrases that capture attention or create an effect, beginning to explain what makes them interesting, surprising or effective in the context of the text.
