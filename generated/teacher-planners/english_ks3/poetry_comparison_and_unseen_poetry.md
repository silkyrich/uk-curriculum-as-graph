## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Cross-textual comparison (EN-KS3-C026)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Making critical comparisons between texts in terms of themes, techniques, contexts, and effects

**Teaching guidance:** Teach comparison as an integrated skill, not two separate analyses joined by a linking phrase. Use comparison grids or Venn diagrams as planning tools, but push students towards fluid comparative paragraphs in their writing. Teach comparative discourse markers: 'Similarly...', 'In contrast...', 'Both writers...', 'While X uses..., Y employs...'. Focus comparisons on three dimensions: theme/ideas, language/technique, and context/perspective. Start with paired passages before asking students to compare whole texts.

**Key vocabulary:** comparison, contrast, similarity, difference, both, whereas, however, similarly, conversely, in contrast, parallel, juxtapose, thematic link, technique, perspective, interpretation

**Common misconceptions:** Students frequently write about each text separately and then add a comparison sentence at the end — the 'tennis match' approach. Some students compare only surface content ('both texts are about war') without comparing how writers treat the subject differently. Others produce heavily imbalanced comparisons, writing extensively about one text and briefly about the other.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | When asked to compare texts, tends to discuss each separately without making connections between them. | Compare how these two poems present the theme of nature. | Writing about each text in turn rather than comparing them; Comparing only subject matter without considering technique |
| **Developing** | Makes basic comparisons between texts, identifying similarities and differences in theme, character or setting, with some use of comparative language. | Compare how two stories you have read present a coming-of-age experience. | Making only surface-level comparisons (both are about X) without analysing technique; Not using comparative discourse markers consistently |
| **Secure** | Develops integrated comparisons that address theme, technique and effect simultaneously, using comparative discourse markers fluently and supporting points with evidence from both texts. | Compare how Dickens in 'A Christmas Carol' and Priestley in 'An Inspector Calls' present the theme of social responsibility. | Comparing content without comparing technique and approach; Not connecting the comparison to the writers' different contexts and purposes |
| **Mastery** | Constructs sophisticated comparative arguments that evaluate how different texts address shared concerns through fundamentally different artistic strategies, and reflects on what the comparison reveals about literature itself. | Compare how a prose fiction writer and a poet address the same human experience, and argue what the comparison reveals about the difference between prose and poetry as forms. | Comparing the texts without reaching a conclusion about what prose and poetry do differently; Treating the comparison as an evaluation (which is better) rather than an analysis of different formal capacities |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *The first poem is about a forest and the writer describes the trees and animals. The second poem is about the sea and the writer describes the waves.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Both stories are about young characters learning something important. In the first story, the character learns through a painful experience -- losing a friend. In the second story, the character learns through a positive experience -- travelling to a new place. Both characters change by the end but in different ways: the first becomes more cautious while the second becomes more confident. However, both stories use first-person narration to show the character's inner thoughts.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Both Dickens and Priestley argue that the wealthy have a moral obligation to the poor, but they use different dramatic strategies to make this argument. Dickens uses supernatural intervention: Scrooge must be shown, through ghostly visions, the human cost of his selfishness before he can change. The transformation is individual -- one man's conscience is awakened. Priestley, by contrast, uses a detective structure: the Inspector systematically exposes each family member's complicity in Eva Smith's death, creating a collective guilt. While Dickens's argument is 'look at the consequences of your personal cruelty', Priestley's is 'you are all responsible for the society you create'. Dickens offers redemption (Scrooge changes and is forgiven); Priestley withholds it (the Birlings learn nothing, and the Inspector's final speech warns of 'fire and blood and anguish'). The difference reflects their historical contexts: Dickens in 1843 believed in individual moral reform; Priestley in 1945, writing after two world wars, demanded systemic political change.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Wilfred Owen's poem 'Dulce et Decorum Est' and Sebastian Faulks's novel 'Birdsong' both depict the horror of World War I trench warfare, but the formal differences between poetry and prose produce fundamentally different kinds of truth. Owen's poem compresses the experience into 28 lines: the gas attack is rendered through a sequence of precise, visceral images ('guttering, choking, drowning') that assault the reader with the same relentlessness as the gas itself. The poem's power lies in its compression -- it does not explain or contextualise, it confronts. Faulks's novel, by contrast, uses the expansiveness of prose to build a world around the horror: the reader knows Stephen Wraysford's pre-war life, his love affair, his inner psychology. When the tunnelling collapse comes, it is devastating not because of its imagery alone but because we have invested hundreds of pages in this character. Poetry creates truth through intensity and compression; prose creates truth through accumulation and immersion. Owen makes you flinch; Faulks makes you grieve. The comparison suggests that the question 'which is the better war text?' is wrong -- poetry and prose do different work on the reader, and the fullest understanding comes from reading both.*

### Secondary concept: Textual evidence citation (EN-KS3-C011)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Supporting interpretations with specific evidence from texts, using quotations effectively

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Makes claims about a text without supporting them with evidence, or retells events rather than using quotations to support a point. | Making unsupported assertions without any textual evidence; Retelling the plot instead of selecting evidence to support a point |
| **Developing** | Selects relevant quotations to support points but may not embed them smoothly or analyse them in detail. | Selecting long quotations without identifying which words are most important; Using quotations as decoration rather than as the basis for analysis |
| **Secure** | Selects short, precise quotations, embeds them fluently within analytical sentences, and uses them as the basis for detailed comment on language and effect. | Analysing quotations in isolation without connecting them to a broader argument; Explaining what the quotation means without analysing how the language creates its effect |
| **Mastery** | Deploys textual evidence with the precision and fluency of an accomplished literary critic, using quotations to build sustained, multi-layered arguments and tracking language patterns across a whole text. | Tracking the motif without explaining its moral significance; Quoting extensively without close analysis of specific word choices |

### Secondary concept: Vocabulary choice analysis (EN-KS3-C016)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Examining how specific word choices create meaning, tone, and effect

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Notices that writers choose particular words but cannot explain why one word was chosen over another. | Saying a word is 'effective' or 'good' without explaining why; Not considering what the word connotes beyond its literal meaning |
| **Developing** | Explains how specific word choices create particular impressions, beginning to consider connotation and tone. | Explaining effect in only one dimension when the word has multiple connotations; Not connecting the word choice to the wider tone of the passage |
| **Secure** | Analyses vocabulary choices with precision, exploring denotation, connotation, semantic fields and the effect of individual words on tone, mood and characterisation. | Comparing the words without explaining what the difference reveals about characterisation or theme; Analysing the word in isolation rather than considering its effect within the whole sentence |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates how vocabulary choices operate as part of a writer's larger strategy, analysing patterns of diction across a text and assessing how word-level choices serve thematic and structural purposes. | Analysing individual words without connecting them to a pattern or strategy; Not showing how opening vocabulary choices anticipate the novel's themes |

### Secondary concept: Poetic conventions recognition (EN-KS3-C019)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Identifying poetic forms (sonnet, ballad, free verse), meter, rhyme schemes, and structural patterns

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Recognises that poetry looks different from prose on the page but cannot name or describe specific poetic conventions. | Defining poetry only by rhyme, missing free verse and other forms; Not recognising stanza breaks as meaningful structural choices |
| **Developing** | Identifies common poetic forms and features including rhyme scheme, stanza form and basic metre, and recognises that these are deliberate choices. | Identifying the rhyme scheme without commenting on its effect; Describing stanza form without considering why the poet chose it |
| **Secure** | Analyses how poetic conventions including form, metre, rhyme, enjambment, caesura and stanza structure work together to create meaning and effect. | Identifying the sonnet form without explaining why Owen chose it; Describing the octave/sestet structure without analysing the effect of the volta |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates how poets use, adapt and subvert poetic conventions to create complex meaning, understanding the relationship between form and content as itself an argument. | Comparing the poems' content without analysing how form itself carries meaning; Describing both poets' use of form without reaching a comparative conclusion |

### Secondary concept: Poetic device analysis (EN-KS3-C020)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Analyzing how poetic devices (imagery, sound patterns, enjambment) create meaning and effect

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Identifies obvious poetic devices (rhyme, alliteration) but cannot explain their effect beyond saying the poem 'sounds nice'. | Identifying a device without explaining its specific effect in context; Using vague evaluative language ('sounds nice', 'flows well') instead of precise analysis |
| **Developing** | Analyses the effect of poetic devices with some detail, beginning to connect sound, imagery and structure to meaning. | Describing enjambment as simply 'the sentence continues onto the next line' without explaining the effect of the specific break point; Not considering how enjambment interacts with other devices in the poem |
| **Secure** | Analyses how multiple poetic devices interact to create layered effects, connecting sound, imagery, structure and meaning with precision. | Analysing sound and imagery separately without exploring how they work together; Identifying the atmosphere without explaining precisely how the combination of devices creates it |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates how poetic devices function within the total design of a poem, assessing how technique serves the poet's thematic and emotional argument across the entire work. | Choosing a technique that is incidental rather than central to the poem's meaning; Describing how the technique works without arguing why it is essential to the poem's thematic purpose |

## Thinking lens: Continuity and Change Over Time (primary)

**Key question:** What has stayed the same, what has changed, and what drove that change?

**Why this lens fits:** The historical dimension of literary heritage positions literature as a record of changing perspectives over time — pupils trace how literary conventions, themes and forms evolve across different periods.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- Was this change gradual or sudden, and what determined the pace?
- What factors promoted continuity, and what factors drove change?
- How significant was this change — did it affect everyone, or only some?
- How do different historians interpret this period of change?

**Secondary lens:** Perspective and Interpretation — Reading across pre-1914 literature, contemporary fiction, Shakespeare and world literature requires pupils to recognise that texts are products of specific cultural and historical perspectives — understanding a Victorian novel or a Shakespearean play requires reconstructing the perspective from which it was written.

---

## Session structure: Text Study + Text Study (Literature)

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Text Study (main structure)
A reading-to-writing cycle for primary and KS3 English. Begins with shared or guided reading of a high-quality text, moves through analysis of language features and authorial choices, builds vocabulary, then scaffolds the writing process from planning through drafting to editing and publication.

`shared_reading` → `analysis` → `vocabulary` → `planning` → `drafting` → `editing`

**Assessment:** Final written outcome in the genre studied, demonstrating understanding of text features, appropriate vocabulary use, and effective application of the writing process.

**Teacher note:** Use the TEXT STUDY template: present a text for close reading, guiding analysis of language, structure, and form in relation to purpose and audience. Expect pupils to use precise literary terminology. Support them in crafting their own writing that consciously deploys techniques studied, with structured peer review and editing focused on the impact of specific choices.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How does the writer use language to achieve a specific effect on the reader?
- What is the relationship between the structure of this text and its meaning?
- How effectively have you deployed the technique in your own writing?
- What revision would most improve the impact of your piece?

### Text Study (Literature)
A KS4 literature study sequence designed for GCSE English Literature preparation. Contextualises the text within its literary and historical period, develops close reading skills, applies literary analysis using subject terminology, supports comparison across texts, and scaffolds essay writing in exam-appropriate formats.

`context_setting` → `close_reading` → `literary_analysis` → `comparison` → `essay_writing`

**Assessment:** Timed essay response in GCSE format demonstrating close textual analysis, use of literary terminology, contextual understanding, and structured argument with embedded quotations.

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Poetry
**Features to teach:** systematic approach to unseen poetry (read, annotate, identify key technique, analyse effect), comparative analytical writing (integrating analysis of two poems rather than treating sequentially), how poets use form and structure to shape meaning (volta, enjambment, caesura, stanza breaks), critical evaluation of poets' choices — moving beyond description to judgement

**Writing outcome:** Write a comparative analytical essay (400-500 words) comparing how two poems present a shared theme, analysing language, form, and structure in both poems; then write an independent response (200-300 words) to an unseen poem

**Literary terms:** volta, enjambment, caesura, stanza, comparative, form, structure, voice, tone, register

---

## Suggested texts

- **Half-Caste** by John Agard — Strong voice; challenges standard analytical approach with Creole register
- **Checking Out Me History** by John Agard — Identity and education themes; appears on AQA GCSE anthology
- **The Emigree** by Carol Rumens — Complex imagery of place and memory; appears on AQA GCSE anthology
- **Tissue** by Imtiaz Dharker — Extended metaphor; demanding but rewarding for close reading at Y9

---

## Genre

- **Poetry:** Literature using rhythm, imagery, and condensed language to convey meaning and emotion. Poetry is continuous across all key stages with no progression break, but expectations increase: from recitation and simple pattern-following (KS1) through multiple forms and figurative language (KS2) to analysis of poetic conventions and unseen poetry comparison (KS4).

---

## Why this study matters

Poetry comparison is the most challenging analytical skill students will face at GCSE, and Y9 is the critical preparation year. This unit develops the ability to hold two poems in mind simultaneously and weave analysis together — rather than writing about one poem then the other. The unseen poetry component builds confidence with unfamiliar texts by teaching a replicable analytical method. Studying poems that appear on the GCSE anthology (Agard, Rumens, Dharker) provides a head start for Literature Paper 2.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Comparative essays structured as 'Poem A' then 'Poem B' rather than integrated thematic comparison
2. Unseen poetry responses default to feature-spotting ('the poet uses alliteration') without analysing effect
3. Students panic with unseen poems because they feel they should already know the 'right' answer

---

## Reading and writing skills (KS3)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Word meaning from context** — Understand the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in simple texts by using the surrounding context, including pictures and sentence sense, to make a reasonable guess at what the word means.
- **Information retrieval from simple texts** — Find and report specific information or key facts from a short piece of fiction or non-fiction, identifying the part of the text where the answer is located.
- **Retelling and sequencing** — Retell the main events of a story or the key steps in a non-fiction text, placing them in the correct order and identifying the most important ideas.
- **Simple inference from text** — Use clues in the text — characters' words, actions and feelings — to work out something the author has not stated directly, and begin to explain the reasoning behind that interpretation.
- **Prediction from text clues** — Predict what is likely to happen next in a story or sequence of events, drawing on what has already been read and on prior knowledge of similar texts and situations.
- **Noticing interesting words and phrases** — Identify and discuss words and phrases that capture attention or create an effect, beginning to explain what makes them interesting, surprising or effective in the context of the text.

| Session length | 30–50 minutes |
| Feedback tone | Examination Coach |
| Normalize struggle | Yes |
| Example correct feedback | *Full marks — you addressed all three assessment objectives: identification, quotation, and analytical comment on the writer's method.* |
| Example error feedback | *This response would earn 2 of 6 marks. You identified the technique correctly (AO1 ✓) and quoted (AO2 ✓), but your analytical comment describes what happens rather than explaining the effect on the reader — that is the AO3 requirement. Revise the final sentence to explain why the technique is effective.* |
