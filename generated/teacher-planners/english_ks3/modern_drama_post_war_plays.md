## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Contemporary literature (EN-KS3-C003)

**Type:** Content | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Reading and analyzing modern literary texts to understand current literary forms and themes

**Teaching guidance:** Select contemporary texts that connect to students' experiences while challenging them stylistically and thematically. Use modern novels, short stories, and journalism as bridges to more demanding literary reading. Encourage students to compare contemporary writers' techniques with those of earlier periods. Reading groups and book clubs work well for contemporary fiction, building peer recommendation cultures.

**Key vocabulary:** contemporary, modern, 21st century, genre fiction, literary fiction, narrative voice, perspective, theme, representation, diverse voices, young adult fiction, short story

**Common misconceptions:** Students sometimes assume contemporary texts are always easier than older ones, not recognising that modern literary fiction can use complex narrative techniques such as unreliable narrators or non-linear timelines. Some students dismiss contemporary texts as less 'literary' than canonical works.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Reads contemporary texts for entertainment but does not reflect on how modern writers use literary techniques or engage with current themes. | What is the main theme of the contemporary novel you have just read? How does the writer explore it? | Summarising plot rather than identifying themes; Not recognising that contemporary writers make deliberate craft choices |
| **Developing** | Begins to identify themes and techniques in contemporary literature, recognising that modern writers make deliberate choices about voice, structure and subject matter. | How does the contemporary novel you have read use narrative voice to engage the reader? | Identifying technique without explaining its effect on the reader; Assuming first-person narration is always autobiographical |
| **Secure** | Analyses contemporary literature with the same critical rigour as canonical texts, understanding how modern writers use form, voice and theme to engage with current issues and literary traditions. | How does a contemporary novelist you have studied use narrative technique to explore a social issue? | Discussing the social issue without connecting it to the writer's narrative choices; Treating the characters as real people rather than constructions designed to achieve an effect |
| **Mastery** | Independently evaluates how contemporary writers extend, challenge or subvert literary traditions, and makes sophisticated connections between modern texts and their literary and social contexts. | Choose a contemporary text and argue how it either continues or breaks with an established literary tradition. | Describing plot rather than analysing how the writer engages with literary tradition; Making superficial connections to literary traditions without detailed analysis of technique |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *The book is about friendship. The main character makes a new friend and they go on adventures together.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *The novel uses first-person present tense which makes it feel immediate, like things are happening right now. The narrator speaks in a way that sounds like a real teenager which makes them relatable. Sometimes the narrator does not tell us everything which creates mystery.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *In 'Noughts and Crosses' by Malorie Blackman, the dual narrative technique alternates between Callum (a nought/white character who is oppressed) and Sephy (a cross/Black character who is privileged). By inverting real-world racial hierarchies and then giving both perspectives, Blackman forces readers to confront prejudice from inside both the victim's and the beneficiary's experience. The alternating chapters create dramatic irony -- we know things each character does not know about the other's situation. This structural choice is more effective than a single narrator because it prevents the reader from simply sympathising with one side.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Kazuo Ishiguro's 'Never Let Me Go' operates within the science fiction tradition but deliberately subverts its conventions. Traditional sci-fi like Wells or Asimov foregrounds the science -- the technology is the plot. Ishiguro buries the science fiction premise (human cloning for organ harvesting) beneath a quiet, nostalgic first-person narration that reads more like a boarding school memoir. The narrator Kathy H. accepts her fate with calm resignation, denying the reader the rebellion or escape that the genre conventionally demands. This technique forces the reader to confront their own complicity -- we want a dystopian hero, but Ishiguro refuses to provide one. The novel extends the literary tradition of the unreliable narrator (Kathy withholds and avoids) while challenging the science fiction tradition by making the science ordinary rather than spectacular. The effect is more unsettling than any conventional dystopia because it suggests that oppressive systems succeed precisely when their victims accept them as normal.*

### Secondary concept: Historical and cultural context (EN-KS3-C013)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Understanding texts within their historical, social, and cultural contexts

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Reads texts without considering the historical or cultural conditions in which they were written, treating all texts as if they were written today. | Assuming that historical context is irrelevant to understanding a text; Judging characters' behaviour by modern standards without historical awareness |
| **Developing** | Recognises that historical and cultural context affects a text's meaning and can identify basic contextual information when prompted. | Mentioning context in general terms without connecting it to specific textual details; Treating context as background information rather than as something that shapes meaning |
| **Secure** | Integrates contextual knowledge into textual analysis, explaining how historical, social and cultural conditions shape a writer's choices and a reader's interpretation. | Adding context as a separate paragraph rather than weaving it into textual analysis; Applying only one contextual lens when multiple contexts are relevant |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates how multiple contexts (historical, cultural, biographical, literary) interact to create meaning, and understands that context is itself an interpretive choice -- different contexts produce different readings. | Presenting one contextual reading as the definitive interpretation; Listing contexts without showing how each produces a distinct reading of specific textual details |

### Secondary concept: Dramatic performance understanding (EN-KS3-C024)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Understanding how plays are communicated through performance elements (acting, staging, direction)

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Understands that plays are performed on stage but focuses primarily on the written text without considering performance elements. | Reading plays as if they were novels, ignoring performance dimensions; Not considering how actors, directors and designers interpret the written text |
| **Developing** | Recognises that drama is intended for performance and considers how acting, staging and direction contribute to the audience's experience. | Making directorial suggestions without connecting them to the text's meaning; Focusing only on acting without considering staging, lighting or sound |
| **Secure** | Analyses how performance elements (acting, staging, lighting, sound, set design, blocking) create meaning and how different productions can create different interpretations of the same text. | Describing staging ideas without explaining how they create different interpretations; Assuming there is one 'correct' way to stage a play |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates how specific production choices create interpretive arguments about a play's meaning, and critiques how performance can reveal dimensions of a text that reading alone cannot access. | Describing the production without explaining how the staging choice functions as interpretation; Not connecting the staging choice to specific textual evidence |

### Secondary concept: Alternative staging interpretation (EN-KS3-C025)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Understanding how different staging choices create different interpretations of dramatic texts

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Assumes that there is one correct way to stage a play and does not consider how different interpretive choices might change meaning. | Confusing surface details (costume, set) with deeper interpretive choices; Assuming historical plays must be staged historically |
| **Developing** | Understands that plays can be staged in different ways and that these choices affect interpretation, though may focus on obvious changes like setting or costume. | Describing the change in setting without analysing how it changes meaning; Assuming modernisation always makes a play more accessible |
| **Secure** | Analyses how specific staging choices create distinct interpretations of a play, understanding that every production is an argument about what the text means. | Describing both stagings without reaching an analytical conclusion about how they change meaning; Not considering how the staging choice interacts with other elements of the play |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates how alternative stagings reveal, challenge or extend the play's possible meanings, understanding that interpretation is an active, creative process and that no single staging exhausts a text's possibilities. | Arguing for a controversial staging on grounds of novelty or representation without showing how it illuminates the text; Not grounding the argument in specific textual evidence that supports the staging interpretation |

### Secondary concept: Script writing (EN-KS3-C032)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Writing dramatic scripts with dialogue, stage directions, and dramatic structure

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Writes scripts that consist mainly of dialogue without stage directions, dramatic structure or distinct character voices. | Writing dialogue that could belong to any character -- no distinctive voices; Omitting stage directions entirely |
| **Developing** | Writes scripts with some stage directions, basic dramatic structure and attempts at distinct character voices. | Stage directions that describe emotions ('she said sadly') rather than actions; Dialogue that tells the audience information the characters would already know |
| **Secure** | Writes scripts with effective dramatic structure, distinct character voices, meaningful stage directions and awareness of how the text would work in performance. | Relying on dialogue alone without using stage directions to create subtext; Making subtext too obvious, undermining the dramatic tension |
| **Mastery** | Writes scripts that demonstrate sophisticated understanding of dramatic form, including structural choices about scene ordering, the relationship between text and performance, and how theatrical conventions create meaning. | Using theatrical conventions as gimmicks rather than as meaningful structural choices; Not considering how the convention would work in actual performance |

## Thinking lens: Continuity and Change Over Time (primary)

**Key question:** What has stayed the same, what has changed, and what drove that change?

**Why this lens fits:** The historical dimension of literary heritage positions literature as a record of changing perspectives over time — pupils trace how literary conventions, themes and forms evolve across different periods.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- Was this change gradual or sudden, and what determined the pace?
- What factors promoted continuity, and what factors drove change?
- How significant was this change — did it affect everyone, or only some?
- How do different historians interpret this period of change?

**Secondary lens:** Perspective and Interpretation — Reading across pre-1914 literature, contemporary fiction, Shakespeare and world literature requires pupils to recognise that texts are products of specific cultural and historical perspectives — understanding a Victorian novel or a Shakespearean play requires reconstructing the perspective from which it was written.

---

## Session structure: Text Study + Text Study (Literature)

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Text Study (main structure)
A reading-to-writing cycle for primary and KS3 English. Begins with shared or guided reading of a high-quality text, moves through analysis of language features and authorial choices, builds vocabulary, then scaffolds the writing process from planning through drafting to editing and publication.

`shared_reading` → `analysis` → `vocabulary` → `planning` → `drafting` → `editing`

**Assessment:** Final written outcome in the genre studied, demonstrating understanding of text features, appropriate vocabulary use, and effective application of the writing process.

**Teacher note:** Use the TEXT STUDY template: present a text for close reading, guiding analysis of language, structure, and form in relation to purpose and audience. Expect pupils to use precise literary terminology. Support them in crafting their own writing that consciously deploys techniques studied, with structured peer review and editing focused on the impact of specific choices.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How does the writer use language to achieve a specific effect on the reader?
- What is the relationship between the structure of this text and its meaning?
- How effectively have you deployed the technique in your own writing?
- What revision would most improve the impact of your piece?

### Text Study (Literature)
A KS4 literature study sequence designed for GCSE English Literature preparation. Contextualises the text within its literary and historical period, develops close reading skills, applies literary analysis using subject terminology, supports comparison across texts, and scaffolds essay writing in exam-appropriate formats.

`context_setting` → `close_reading` → `literary_analysis` → `comparison` → `essay_writing`

**Assessment:** Timed essay response in GCSE format demonstrating close textual analysis, use of literary terminology, contextual understanding, and structured argument with embedded quotations.

---

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Drama
**Features to teach:** dramatic irony and its use as a tool for social commentary, staging and set design as carriers of meaning (single room, realistic props, symbolic elements), character as vehicle for authorial message (the Inspector as dramatic device, not a realistic person), audience response across time periods (how meaning changes as context changes)

**Writing outcome:** Write an analytical essay (400-500 words) exploring how the dramatist uses dramatic techniques to present ideas about social responsibility or class, analysing how staging choices and dramatic irony contribute to the play's message

**Literary terms:** dramatic irony, stage direction, didactic, morality play, dramatic device, social commentary, naturalistic, symbolism

---

## Suggested texts

- **An Inspector Calls** by J.B. Priestley — Most widely-studied modern text at GCSE; KS3 study gives significant GCSE advantage
- **Journey's End** by R.C. Sherriff — Alternative: WWI setting with powerful dramatic tension in confined space

---

## Genre

- **Drama:** Dramatic literature studied for its theatrical and literary qualities. Distinct from KS1-KS2 playscript writing: at KS3-KS4, drama means studying published plays as literary texts, analysing dramatic conventions, and understanding performance context. Shakespeare study is the dominant form at KS4.

---

## Why this study matters

Post-war British drama is the dominant modern text category at GCSE (An Inspector Calls is studied by 75-80% of AQA entries). Introducing it at Y9 gives students a significant advantage: they arrive at GCSE with familiarity with the text, the genre conventions, and the analytical vocabulary. The play's tight structure, didactic purpose, and social themes provide excellent material for developing the kind of analytical writing that GCSE demands — moving beyond what characters do to how the dramatist constructs meaning.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Students treat the play as a whodunit mystery rather than analysing its moral argument about collective responsibility
2. The Inspector analysed as a realistic character rather than understood as a dramatic device
3. Historical context (1912 setting, 1945 audience) mentioned but not integrated into analysis of how dramatic irony works across the two time frames

## Cross-curricular opportunities

| Link | Subject | Connection | Strength |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| Challenges 1901 to Present Day | History | Edwardian class system, World Wars, creation of the welfare state, and post-war social change | Strong |

---

## Reading and writing skills (KS3)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Word meaning from context** — Understand the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in simple texts by using the surrounding context, including pictures and sentence sense, to make a reasonable guess at what the word means.
- **Information retrieval from simple texts** — Find and report specific information or key facts from a short piece of fiction or non-fiction, identifying the part of the text where the answer is located.
- **Retelling and sequencing** — Retell the main events of a story or the key steps in a non-fiction text, placing them in the correct order and identifying the most important ideas.
- **Simple inference from text** — Use clues in the text — characters' words, actions and feelings — to work out something the author has not stated directly, and begin to explain the reasoning behind that interpretation.
- **Prediction from text clues** — Predict what is likely to happen next in a story or sequence of events, drawing on what has already been read and on prior knowledge of similar texts and situations.
- **Noticing interesting words and phrases** — Identify and discuss words and phrases that capture attention or create an effect, beginning to explain what makes them interesting, surprising or effective in the context of the text.

## Scaffolding and inclusion (Y9)

| Guideline | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Reading level | GCSE Preparation Reader (Lexile 950–1250) |
| Text-to-speech | Available |
| Vocabulary | GCSE-level academic vocabulary. Command words (analyse, evaluate, compare, justify, assess) must be explicitly taught and used correctly. |
| Scaffolding level | Minimal |
| Hint tiers | 3 tiers |
| Session length | 30–50 minutes |
| Feedback tone | Examination Coach |
| Normalize struggle | Yes |
| Example correct feedback | *Full marks — you addressed all three assessment objectives: identification, quotation, and analytical comment on the writer's method.* |
| Example error feedback | *This response would earn 2 of 6 marks. You identified the technique correctly (AO1 ✓) and quoted (AO2 ✓), but your analytical comment describes what happens rather than explaining the effect on the reader — that is the AO3 requirement. Revise the final sentence to explain why the technique is effective.* |
