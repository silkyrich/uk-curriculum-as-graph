## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Shakespeare study (EN-KS3-C004)

**Type:** Content | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Studying two Shakespeare plays to understand Early Modern drama, language, and themes

**Teaching guidance:** Begin with accessible scenes that hook students before progressing to more challenging language. Use a combination of reading aloud, watching filmed performances, and active drama approaches (e.g., freeze frames, hot-seating characters). Provide a glossary of key Shakespearean vocabulary and teach students to decode Early Modern syntax. Focus on the plays as performance texts — ask 'what would an actor do here?' to bring the language alive.

**Key vocabulary:** Shakespeare, Early Modern English, soliloquy, aside, blank verse, iambic pentameter, prose, dramatic irony, tragedy, comedy, folio, stage direction, act, scene, monologue, couplet

**Common misconceptions:** Students often believe Shakespeare is written in 'Old English' (which is actually Anglo-Saxon). Many students think they cannot understand Shakespeare at all, when in fact most vocabulary is recognisable with context support. Some students focus only on plot, missing that Shakespeare's language choices are central to meaning.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Understands the basic plot of a Shakespeare play when supported but struggles to decode the language independently. | In your own words, explain what is happening in this scene from 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' where Puck puts the love potion on Lysander's eyes. | Confusing characters because of unfamiliar names; Believing Shakespeare is written in Old English rather than Early Modern English |
| **Developing** | Follows Shakespeare's plots and identifies key characters, themes and some language features with teacher support, beginning to recognise that Shakespeare's language carries layers of meaning. | In Macbeth's soliloquy 'Is this a dagger which I see before me', what does the dagger represent? Why does Shakespeare give this speech to Macbeth alone on stage? | Taking the dagger literally rather than recognising its symbolic function; Not explaining why the soliloquy form is significant |
| **Secure** | Analyses Shakespeare's language, dramatic conventions and themes with confidence, understanding how his techniques create specific effects on an audience. | How does Shakespeare use the contrast between verse and prose in 'Much Ado About Nothing' to reveal character and social status? | Stating that verse is for important characters and prose for unimportant ones without exploring exceptions and shifts; Not connecting the verse/prose distinction to specific dramatic effects |
| **Mastery** | Independently analyses Shakespeare's plays as complex works of dramatic art, evaluating how language, form, structure and theatrical context create layered meaning. | How does Shakespeare use dramatic irony across 'Macbeth' to shape the audience's moral response to the protagonist? | Discussing dramatic irony in individual scenes without tracing its development across the whole play; Not connecting dramatic irony to its effect on the audience's moral judgement |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Puck puts magic juice on the wrong person's eyes. When Lysander wakes up he falls in love with Helena instead of Hermia.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *The dagger represents Macbeth's temptation to murder King Duncan. He is imagining it because he is conflicted about whether to go through with the plan. Shakespeare makes this a soliloquy -- spoken alone on stage -- so the audience can hear Macbeth's private thoughts. This shows that in public Macbeth appears loyal, but privately he is being pulled towards violence.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Shakespeare uses blank verse (unrhymed iambic pentameter) for the noble characters Claudio and Hero in their romantic scenes, which gives their language a formal, elevated quality appropriate to aristocratic courtship. By contrast, Benedick and Beatrice often speak in witty prose, which signals their more grounded, sharp-tongued personalities and their rejection of romantic convention. The Watch, who are lower-class characters, speak in bumbling prose full of malapropisms ('Marry, sir, they have committed false report'), which creates comedy through language itself. The shift from prose to verse can also signal a shift in emotional register: when Beatrice says 'Kill Claudio' in prose, the directness is shocking precisely because it breaks the verse pattern the audience expects in a serious moment. Shakespeare uses the verse/prose distinction as a dramatic tool, not just a stylistic habit.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Shakespeare creates dramatic irony from the very first scene: the witches' prophecy tells the audience what Macbeth will become before Macbeth himself knows, so every subsequent scene of his loyalty is shadowed by our knowledge of his future betrayal. When Duncan arrives at Macbeth's castle and praises its pleasant air, the audience knows he is entering a death trap -- this creates a painful tension between the dramatic world and our knowledge. As the play progresses, the dramatic irony shifts: initially we know more than the characters, but after the murder, other characters (Macduff, Malcolm) begin to suspect what we already know, and the irony becomes about how long the pretence can hold. By Act 5, the dramatic irony reverses entirely -- Macbeth believes the witches' second prophecy protects him ('none of woman born'), but the audience suspects it will be fulfilled unexpectedly. This structural arc of irony shapes our moral response: we feel complicit in Act 2 (we knew and could not prevent it), anxious in Act 3 (we watch the cover-up), and grimly satisfied in Act 5 (the irony turns against Macbeth). Shakespeare uses dramatic irony not just as a plot device but as a moral architecture.*

### Secondary concept: Historical and cultural context (EN-KS3-C013)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Understanding texts within their historical, social, and cultural contexts

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Reads texts without considering the historical or cultural conditions in which they were written, treating all texts as if they were written today. | Assuming that historical context is irrelevant to understanding a text; Judging characters' behaviour by modern standards without historical awareness |
| **Developing** | Recognises that historical and cultural context affects a text's meaning and can identify basic contextual information when prompted. | Mentioning context in general terms without connecting it to specific textual details; Treating context as background information rather than as something that shapes meaning |
| **Secure** | Integrates contextual knowledge into textual analysis, explaining how historical, social and cultural conditions shape a writer's choices and a reader's interpretation. | Adding context as a separate paragraph rather than weaving it into textual analysis; Applying only one contextual lens when multiple contexts are relevant |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates how multiple contexts (historical, cultural, biographical, literary) interact to create meaning, and understands that context is itself an interpretive choice -- different contexts produce different readings. | Presenting one contextual reading as the definitive interpretation; Listing contexts without showing how each produces a distinct reading of specific textual details |

### Secondary concept: Characterisation analysis (EN-KS3-C023)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Analyzing how characters are developed through description, dialogue, actions, and relationships

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Describes characters by their physical appearance or basic personality traits but does not analyse how the writer constructs them. | Treating characters as real people rather than as constructions by the writer; Describing personality without using evidence from the text |
| **Developing** | Explains how a character is presented through specific textual details, including what they say, do and how others respond to them. | Relying only on what the writer explicitly tells us rather than analysing indirect characterisation; Not considering how different techniques (dialogue, action, others' reactions) work together |
| **Secure** | Analyses how characters are constructed through multiple techniques, understanding how characterisation develops across a text and how characters serve thematic purposes. | Tracing the character arc without analysing the specific techniques Shakespeare uses; Discussing Lady Macbeth as if she were a real person rather than a dramatic construction |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates how characterisation functions within the text's larger thematic and structural design, analysing how characters relate to each other, to genre conventions and to the writer's moral or political argument. | Arguing that the character is a device without showing how this serves the text's purpose; Not considering whether the character also has elements of psychological realism alongside their structural function |

### Secondary concept: Dramatic performance understanding (EN-KS3-C024)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Understanding how plays are communicated through performance elements (acting, staging, direction)

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Understands that plays are performed on stage but focuses primarily on the written text without considering performance elements. | Reading plays as if they were novels, ignoring performance dimensions; Not considering how actors, directors and designers interpret the written text |
| **Developing** | Recognises that drama is intended for performance and considers how acting, staging and direction contribute to the audience's experience. | Making directorial suggestions without connecting them to the text's meaning; Focusing only on acting without considering staging, lighting or sound |
| **Secure** | Analyses how performance elements (acting, staging, lighting, sound, set design, blocking) create meaning and how different productions can create different interpretations of the same text. | Describing staging ideas without explaining how they create different interpretations; Assuming there is one 'correct' way to stage a play |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates how specific production choices create interpretive arguments about a play's meaning, and critiques how performance can reveal dimensions of a text that reading alone cannot access. | Describing the production without explaining how the staging choice functions as interpretation; Not connecting the staging choice to specific textual evidence |

### Secondary concept: Dramatic improvisation (EN-KS3-C072)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Creating spontaneous dramatic responses and dialogue in role

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Finds improvisation difficult and tends to freeze, repeat others' ideas, or break character quickly. | Breaking character immediately when uncertain; Not committing to the improvised scenario |
| **Developing** | Engages with improvisation, sustaining a character and scenario for a short time and responding to partners' contributions. | Trying to control the whole scene rather than responding to the partner; Falling back on stereotypes rather than creating a specific character |
| **Secure** | Improvises confidently, creating believable characters, sustaining scenarios, and using dramatic techniques such as tension, status shifts and subtext. | Creating tension through melodrama rather than subtlety; Not trusting the partner to contribute to the dramatic development |
| **Mastery** | Improvises with creativity, skill and dramatic intelligence, creating scenes that explore complex ideas and emotions through spontaneous performance. | Resolving the dilemma too neatly rather than letting it remain complex; Using improvisation to be entertaining rather than to explore meaning |

## Thinking lens: Continuity and Change Over Time (primary)

**Key question:** What has stayed the same, what has changed, and what drove that change?

**Why this lens fits:** The historical dimension of literary heritage positions literature as a record of changing perspectives over time — pupils trace how literary conventions, themes and forms evolve across different periods.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- Was this change gradual or sudden, and what determined the pace?
- What factors promoted continuity, and what factors drove change?
- How significant was this change — did it affect everyone, or only some?
- How do different historians interpret this period of change?

**Secondary lens:** Perspective and Interpretation — Reading across pre-1914 literature, contemporary fiction, Shakespeare and world literature requires pupils to recognise that texts are products of specific cultural and historical perspectives — understanding a Victorian novel or a Shakespearean play requires reconstructing the perspective from which it was written.

## Session structure: Text Study + Text Study (Literature)

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Text Study (main structure)
A reading-to-writing cycle for primary and KS3 English. Begins with shared or guided reading of a high-quality text, moves through analysis of language features and authorial choices, builds vocabulary, then scaffolds the writing process from planning through drafting to editing and publication.

`shared_reading` → `analysis` → `vocabulary` → `planning` → `drafting` → `editing`

**Assessment:** Final written outcome in the genre studied, demonstrating understanding of text features, appropriate vocabulary use, and effective application of the writing process.

**Teacher note:** Use the TEXT STUDY template: present a text for close reading, guiding analysis of language, structure, and form in relation to purpose and audience. Expect pupils to use precise literary terminology. Support them in crafting their own writing that consciously deploys techniques studied, with structured peer review and editing focused on the impact of specific choices.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How does the writer use language to achieve a specific effect on the reader?
- What is the relationship between the structure of this text and its meaning?
- How effectively have you deployed the technique in your own writing?
- What revision would most improve the impact of your piece?

### Text Study (Literature)
A KS4 literature study sequence designed for GCSE English Literature preparation. Contextualises the text within its literary and historical period, develops close reading skills, applies literary analysis using subject terminology, supports comparison across texts, and scaffolds essay writing in exam-appropriate formats.

`context_setting` → `close_reading` → `literary_analysis` → `comparison` → `essay_writing`

**Assessment:** Timed essay response in GCSE format demonstrating close textual analysis, use of literary terminology, contextual understanding, and structured argument with embedded quotations.

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Drama
**Features to teach:** dramatic verse as vehicle for complex ideas (Prospero's speeches on power and forgiveness), colonialism and power dynamics (Prospero-Caliban-Ariel relationship), structural control (Aristotelian unities of time, place, and action), directorial interpretation (how staging choices shape audience understanding)

**Writing outcome:** Write an analytical essay (400-500 words) exploring how Shakespeare presents the theme of power or forgiveness in The Tempest, evaluating how directorial choices could affect audience interpretation

**Literary terms:** romance, epilogue, colonialism, allegory, dramatic verse, unities, stage direction, monologue

---

## Suggested texts

- **The Tempest** by William Shakespeare — More linguistically demanding than A Midsummer Night's Dream; themes of power and colonialism reward mature discussion
- **The Tempest (Cambridge School Shakespeare)** by Rex Gibson (ed.) — Glossed edition with critical context for classroom study

---

## Genre

- **Drama:** Dramatic literature studied for its theatrical and literary qualities. Distinct from KS1-KS2 playscript writing: at KS3-KS4, drama means studying published plays as literary texts, analysing dramatic conventions, and understanding performance context. Shakespeare study is the dominant form at KS4.

---

## Why this study matters

The Tempest provides a more complex second Shakespeare text for KS3, building on the dramatic reading skills developed with A Midsummer Night's Dream. Its themes of colonialism, power, and forgiveness invite genuine critical debate about how we read Shakespeare in a modern context. The Prospero-Caliban relationship is a rich entry point for discussing how texts can be reinterpreted across time. The play prepares students for the analytical demands of GCSE Shakespeare.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Students assume Prospero is straightforwardly heroic without questioning his treatment of Caliban and Ariel
2. Colonial reading treated as the only valid interpretation rather than one among several
3. Complex verse passages skipped rather than worked through slowly with students

## Cross-curricular opportunities

| Link | Subject | Connection | Strength |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| Ideas, Power, Industry and Empire 1745-1901 | History | European colonialism, exploration, and the Age of Empire | Strong |
| Africa: Place Depth Study | Geography | Colonial encounters and their legacy in Africa — parallels with Prospero-Caliban dynamic | Moderate |

## Reading and writing skills (KS3)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Word meaning from context** — Understand the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in simple texts by using the surrounding context, including pictures and sentence sense, to make a reasonable guess at what the word means.
- **Information retrieval from simple texts** — Find and report specific information or key facts from a short piece of fiction or non-fiction, identifying the part of the text where the answer is located.
- **Retelling and sequencing** — Retell the main events of a story or the key steps in a non-fiction text, placing them in the correct order and identifying the most important ideas.
- **Simple inference from text** — Use clues in the text — characters' words, actions and feelings — to work out something the author has not stated directly, and begin to explain the reasoning behind that interpretation.
- **Prediction from text clues** — Predict what is likely to happen next in a story or sequence of events, drawing on what has already been read and on prior knowledge of similar texts and situations.
- **Noticing interesting words and phrases** — Identify and discuss words and phrases that capture attention or create an effect, beginning to explain what makes them interesting, surprising or effective in the context of the text.
