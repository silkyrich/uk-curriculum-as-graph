## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Formal debate participation (EN-KS3-C068)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Participating in structured debates following conventions and rules

**Teaching guidance:** Teach debate conventions explicitly: proposing and opposing motions, speaking within time limits, addressing the chair, point of information, and rebuttal. Use simplified debate formats (e.g., 'balloon debate', 'silent debate' in writing first) before progressing to formal structures. Teach the difference between attacking an argument and attacking a person. Use preparation time to research and plan arguments systematically. Debrief debates to evaluate the quality of arguments, not just who 'won'.

**Key vocabulary:** debate, motion, proposition, opposition, rebuttal, point of information, chair, floor, formal, argument, counter-argument, evidence, persuade, convince, reasoning, conclude, summing up

**Common misconceptions:** Students often confuse debate with argument in the everyday sense — becoming emotionally heated rather than arguing rationally. Some students struggle to argue a position they personally disagree with, not understanding that debate is about reasoning skill, not personal belief. Others focus on 'winning' rather than on the quality and logic of their arguments.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Participates in debate reluctantly or chaotically, making assertions without evidence or repeating the same point. | Debate whether homework should be abolished. You are arguing in favour. | Repeating assertions without developing them; Not anticipating or responding to the opposing argument |
| **Developing** | Participates in formal debates with some structure, presenting claims with evidence and attempting to address opposing arguments. | Present a two-minute argument in a formal debate, including evidence and a response to the opposition. | Presenting arguments in random order rather than building strategically; Acknowledging counter-arguments without effectively rebutting them |
| **Secure** | Debates formally with skill, building structured arguments, rebutting opposition points effectively, and adapting to the debate's development in real time. | Participate in a full debate, including opening statement, rebuttal and closing summary. | Preparing a strong opening but being unable to rebut in real time; Closing with a summary that does not account for what happened during the debate |
| **Mastery** | Debates with authority and strategic skill, using rhetorical technique, evidence and persuasive delivery to build a compelling case while engaging genuinely with opposing arguments. | Lead a debate team, coordinating arguments across speakers and responding to the strongest opposition points. | Focusing on winning the debate rather than engaging genuinely with the ideas; Using rhetoric to obscure rather than illuminate |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *'Homework should be abolished because it is boring and unfair. Everyone hates it. It is just boring.'*

> **Model response (Developing):** *[Presents an argument with claims supported by at least one piece of evidence. Acknowledges a counter-argument ('Some people say... however...'). Maintains formal register for most of the speech. May not fully rebut the counter-argument.]*

> **Model response (Secure):** *[Delivers a structured opening argument with three clear points. During rebuttal, responds directly to specific points made by the opposition rather than repeating the original argument. Closing summary synthesises the debate rather than simply restating the opening position. Adapts to unexpected arguments from the opposition with composure.]*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *[Coordinates a team debate where arguments are distributed strategically across speakers, each building on the previous one. Anticipates the strongest opposition points and prepares rebuttals in advance. Deploys rhetorical techniques (anaphora, tricolon, strategic concession) for maximum persuasive impact. Engages with the opposition's strongest points rather than attacking their weakest ones, demonstrating intellectual confidence.]*

### Secondary concept: Standard English in speech (EN-KS3-C060)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Using Standard English confidently in formal speaking situations

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Uses informal speech patterns in all contexts, including formal ones, without recognising when Standard English is required. | Using fillers ('like', 'basically', 'literally') in formal spoken contexts; Not recognising the difference between casual conversation and formal speech |
| **Developing** | Recognises when Standard English is appropriate in speech and makes conscious efforts to use it, though may lapse into informal patterns under pressure. | Sustaining Standard English in rehearsed sections but lapsing in spontaneous moments; Using Standard English vocabulary but with non-standard grammar ('we was') |
| **Secure** | Uses Standard English fluently and confidently in formal spoken contexts, adapting register, vocabulary and syntax to the formality of the situation. | Using Standard English but in a way that sounds scripted rather than natural; Not adjusting formality within the Standard English spectrum (e.g. being equally formal to a teacher and to a head of state) |
| **Mastery** | Speaks in Standard English with complete fluency across all formal contexts, code-switching naturally between Standard English and informal speech as context demands. | Maintaining Standard English at the cost of warmth or engagement; Not recognising that fluent Standard English speakers still adapt their register within Standard English |

### Secondary concept: Speech structure and organization (EN-KS3-C065)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Organizing speeches and presentations with clear introduction, body, and conclusion

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Speaks without clear structure, wandering between points and losing the audience's attention. | Not planning spoken contributions in advance; Lacking a clear beginning, middle or end |
| **Developing** | Organises speeches and presentations with a recognisable structure (introduction, body, conclusion) and signals transitions between points. | Using rigid signposting that sounds mechanical ('My first point is...'); Structuring the presentation but not pacing it for audience engagement |
| **Secure** | Structures speeches and presentations with skill, using varied organisational strategies and pacing content for maximum impact. | Using structural variety for its own sake rather than to serve the argument; Not adapting structure to the specific purpose and audience |
| **Mastery** | Structures spoken presentations as purposefully as the best written arguments, using organisational strategies that shape the audience's understanding and emotional response. | Using sophisticated structures that confuse rather than enlighten the audience; Not ensuring that structural sophistication serves clarity |

### Secondary concept: Clear idea expression (EN-KS3-C066)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Expressing ideas clearly and concisely in spoken form

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Struggles to express ideas clearly in speech, using vague language, false starts and incomplete sentences. | Starting sentences without knowing how they will end; Using vague pronouns ('it', 'that', 'they') without making clear what they refer to |
| **Developing** | Expresses ideas with reasonable clarity, using complete sentences and specific vocabulary, though may struggle with more complex ideas. | Expressing simple ideas clearly but becoming unclear with complex ones; Not providing enough detail or explanation to make the point fully clear |
| **Secure** | Expresses complex ideas clearly and concisely in speech, using precise vocabulary and well-constructed sentences that communicate meaning effectively. | Being precise at the cost of accessibility, or accessible at the cost of precision; Not checking understanding or adapting explanation when the audience looks confused |
| **Mastery** | Articulates ideas with the clarity and precision of a skilled communicator, adapting explanation to audience and context in real time. | Using the same explanation regardless of audience; Talking down to less experienced audiences rather than making ideas genuinely accessible |

### Secondary concept: Speaking confidence (EN-KS3-C083)

**Type:** Attitude | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Developing confidence to speak in formal contexts without excessive anxiety

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Avoids speaking in formal contexts due to anxiety or lack of confidence, contributing minimally or not at all. | Equating lack of confidence with lack of ability; Not recognising that confidence develops through practice, not through waiting until one feels ready |
| **Developing** | Speaks in formal contexts with some nervousness but pushes through anxiety to make contributions, particularly when the environment feels supportive. | Rushing through presentations to finish quickly; Reading directly from notes rather than speaking to the audience |
| **Secure** | Speaks with confidence in formal contexts, managing nervousness effectively and projecting competence through clear delivery, eye contact and composed body language. | Appearing confident but not genuinely engaging with the audience; Confusing confidence with loudness |
| **Mastery** | Speaks with genuine confidence and presence in any formal context, engaging audiences of different sizes and types, and understanding that confidence comes from preparation, practice and self-awareness. | Attributing confidence to personality rather than to practice and strategy; Not recognising that even confident speakers experience nerves |

## Thinking lens: Perspective and Interpretation (primary)

**Key question:** Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?

**Why this lens fits:** Recognising when to deploy Standard English vs informal spoken register requires pupils to read the social context and audience perspective — register choice is a perspectival decision about how to position oneself in relation to the listener and occasion.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- What contextual factors shaped this perspective?
- How does the author's position affect the reliability of this account?
- Whose perspective is missing from this record, and why does that matter?
- How have interpretations of this event changed over time, and what drove those changes?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Structured speech organisation and maintaining focus on a topic are the spoken forms of argument structure — pupils must sequence claims, evidence and development in a way that builds a coherent, purposeful contribution.

---

## Session structure: Discussion and Debate + Performance

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Discussion and Debate (main structure)
A structured sequence for exploring contested issues or multiple perspectives. Begins with a stimulus that raises a question or dilemma, builds knowledge through research, develops arguments through structured discussion techniques, captures thinking in writing, and reflects on how views may have changed.

`stimulus` → `research` → `structured_discussion` → `writing` → `reflection`

**Assessment:** Balanced written argument or persuasive piece demonstrating understanding of multiple perspectives, supported by evidence, with a reasoned personal conclusion.

**Teacher note:** Use the DISCUSSION AND DEBATE template: present a substantive question or ethical dilemma. Expect pupils to research different perspectives and prepare evidence-based arguments. Facilitate structured discussion using protocols such as Harkness or four corners. Guide pupils to produce a written response that acknowledges multiple viewpoints and justifies their own position.

**KS3 question stems:**
- What are the strongest arguments on each side of this issue?
- What evidence supports this perspective, and how reliable is it?
- How would you respond to the main counter-argument?
- How has the discussion changed or strengthened your view?

### Performance
A sequence building towards a culminating performance in music, drama, or physical activity. Pupils study repertoire or material, develop technical skills through focused practice, rehearse with attention to expression and communication, perform to an audience (real or virtual), and evaluate their own and others' performances.

`repertoire_study` → `technique_development` → `rehearsal` → `performance` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Performance assessed against subject-specific criteria (musical accuracy, expression, dramatic impact, physical skill execution) plus reflective self-evaluation.

**Teacher note:** Use the PERFORMANCE template: analyse repertoire or performance material in terms of style, structure, and technique. Develop skills through targeted exercises and progressively challenging practice. Guide independent and ensemble rehearsal with attention to interpretation, expression, and technical precision. Facilitate critical evaluation of performance using subject-specific criteria.

**KS3 question stems:**
- What stylistic and technical features define this piece or performance?
- How will you target your practice to address your weaknesses?
- What interpretive choices have you made, and how do they affect the performance?
- How would you evaluate your performance against the assessment criteria?

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Non Fiction
**Features to teach:** formal debate structure (proposition, opposition, rebuttals, points of information, summing up), presentation skills (clear structure, audience engagement, use of evidence, pacing and emphasis), active listening and building on others' contributions, Standard English in formal spoken contexts — register shifting between informal discussion and formal address

**Writing outcome:** Prepare a structured speech (3-4 minutes) for a formal debate on a curriculum-linked topic, with a written cue card including opening hook, three developed arguments with evidence, anticipated counter-arguments, and a concluding statement

**Literary terms:** rhetoric, proposition, rebuttal, Standard English, register

---

## Genre

- **Transactional:** Purpose-driven non-fiction forms written for a specific audience and context. The KS3-KS4 progression from KS2 persuasion and discussion: at GCSE, transactional writing encompasses all non-fiction forms (letter, article, speech, review, report) and is assessed on audience awareness, register control, and rhetorical effectiveness. The most frequently examined writing form on GCSE Language Paper 2.

---

## Why this study matters

Spoken language is a statutory component of the KS3 curriculum and the foundation for the GCSE Spoken Language Endorsement. Formal debate develops the ability to construct and sustain an argument orally, respond to challenge in real time, and use Standard English in a public context — skills that transfer directly to written argumentation, job interviews, and university seminars. Regular debate practice across all three years ensures oracy development is not a one-off event but a progressive curriculum strand.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Debates degenerate into unstructured shouting matches without formal rules and turn-taking
2. Students read from scripts with no eye contact or audience engagement
3. Standard English lapses when responding to challenges or points of information
4. Weaker speakers are sidelined in team debates — all students need speaking roles

## Cross-curricular opportunities

| Link | Subject | Connection | Strength |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| Challenges 1901 to Present Day | History | Debating historical interpretations — was the British Empire a force for good? Was appeasement justified? | Moderate |

## Reading and writing skills (KS3)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Word meaning from context** — Understand the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in simple texts by using the surrounding context, including pictures and sentence sense, to make a reasonable guess at what the word means.
- **Information retrieval from simple texts** — Find and report specific information or key facts from a short piece of fiction or non-fiction, identifying the part of the text where the answer is located.
- **Retelling and sequencing** — Retell the main events of a story or the key steps in a non-fiction text, placing them in the correct order and identifying the most important ideas.
- **Simple inference from text** — Use clues in the text — characters' words, actions and feelings — to work out something the author has not stated directly, and begin to explain the reasoning behind that interpretation.
- **Prediction from text clues** — Predict what is likely to happen next in a story or sequence of events, drawing on what has already been read and on prior knowledge of similar texts and situations.
- **Noticing interesting words and phrases** — Identify and discuss words and phrases that capture attention or create an effect, beginning to explain what makes them interesting, surprising or effective in the context of the text.
