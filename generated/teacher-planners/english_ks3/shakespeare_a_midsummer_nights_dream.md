## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Shakespeare study (EN-KS3-C004)

**Type:** Content | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Studying two Shakespeare plays to understand Early Modern drama, language, and themes

**Teaching guidance:** Begin with accessible scenes that hook students before progressing to more challenging language. Use a combination of reading aloud, watching filmed performances, and active drama approaches (e.g., freeze frames, hot-seating characters). Provide a glossary of key Shakespearean vocabulary and teach students to decode Early Modern syntax. Focus on the plays as performance texts — ask 'what would an actor do here?' to bring the language alive.

**Key vocabulary:** Shakespeare, Early Modern English, soliloquy, aside, blank verse, iambic pentameter, prose, dramatic irony, tragedy, comedy, folio, stage direction, act, scene, monologue, couplet

**Common misconceptions:** Students often believe Shakespeare is written in 'Old English' (which is actually Anglo-Saxon). Many students think they cannot understand Shakespeare at all, when in fact most vocabulary is recognisable with context support. Some students focus only on plot, missing that Shakespeare's language choices are central to meaning.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Understands the basic plot of a Shakespeare play when supported but struggles to decode the language independently. | In your own words, explain what is happening in this scene from 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' where Puck puts the love potion on Lysander's eyes. | Confusing characters because of unfamiliar names; Believing Shakespeare is written in Old English rather than Early Modern English |
| **Developing** | Follows Shakespeare's plots and identifies key characters, themes and some language features with teacher support, beginning to recognise that Shakespeare's language carries layers of meaning. | In Macbeth's soliloquy 'Is this a dagger which I see before me', what does the dagger represent? Why does Shakespeare give this speech to Macbeth alone on stage? | Taking the dagger literally rather than recognising its symbolic function; Not explaining why the soliloquy form is significant |
| **Secure** | Analyses Shakespeare's language, dramatic conventions and themes with confidence, understanding how his techniques create specific effects on an audience. | How does Shakespeare use the contrast between verse and prose in 'Much Ado About Nothing' to reveal character and social status? | Stating that verse is for important characters and prose for unimportant ones without exploring exceptions and shifts; Not connecting the verse/prose distinction to specific dramatic effects |
| **Mastery** | Independently analyses Shakespeare's plays as complex works of dramatic art, evaluating how language, form, structure and theatrical context create layered meaning. | How does Shakespeare use dramatic irony across 'Macbeth' to shape the audience's moral response to the protagonist? | Discussing dramatic irony in individual scenes without tracing its development across the whole play; Not connecting dramatic irony to its effect on the audience's moral judgement |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Puck puts magic juice on the wrong person's eyes. When Lysander wakes up he falls in love with Helena instead of Hermia.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *The dagger represents Macbeth's temptation to murder King Duncan. He is imagining it because he is conflicted about whether to go through with the plan. Shakespeare makes this a soliloquy -- spoken alone on stage -- so the audience can hear Macbeth's private thoughts. This shows that in public Macbeth appears loyal, but privately he is being pulled towards violence.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Shakespeare uses blank verse (unrhymed iambic pentameter) for the noble characters Claudio and Hero in their romantic scenes, which gives their language a formal, elevated quality appropriate to aristocratic courtship. By contrast, Benedick and Beatrice often speak in witty prose, which signals their more grounded, sharp-tongued personalities and their rejection of romantic convention. The Watch, who are lower-class characters, speak in bumbling prose full of malapropisms ('Marry, sir, they have committed false report'), which creates comedy through language itself. The shift from prose to verse can also signal a shift in emotional register: when Beatrice says 'Kill Claudio' in prose, the directness is shocking precisely because it breaks the verse pattern the audience expects in a serious moment. Shakespeare uses the verse/prose distinction as a dramatic tool, not just a stylistic habit.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Shakespeare creates dramatic irony from the very first scene: the witches' prophecy tells the audience what Macbeth will become before Macbeth himself knows, so every subsequent scene of his loyalty is shadowed by our knowledge of his future betrayal. When Duncan arrives at Macbeth's castle and praises its pleasant air, the audience knows he is entering a death trap -- this creates a painful tension between the dramatic world and our knowledge. As the play progresses, the dramatic irony shifts: initially we know more than the characters, but after the murder, other characters (Macduff, Malcolm) begin to suspect what we already know, and the irony becomes about how long the pretence can hold. By Act 5, the dramatic irony reverses entirely -- Macbeth believes the witches' second prophecy protects him ('none of woman born'), but the audience suspects it will be fulfilled unexpectedly. This structural arc of irony shapes our moral response: we feel complicit in Act 2 (we knew and could not prevent it), anxious in Act 3 (we watch the cover-up), and grimly satisfied in Act 5 (the irony turns against Macbeth). Shakespeare uses dramatic irony not just as a plot device but as a moral architecture.*

### Secondary concept: Figurative language analysis (EN-KS3-C015)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Identifying and analyzing metaphors, similes, personification, and other figurative devices

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify simple figurative devices (simile, metaphor) when prompted but struggles to explain their effect beyond naming them. | Naming the device without explaining its effect ('the writer uses a simile'); Confusing simile and metaphor |
| **Developing** | Identifies figurative language and explains its effect with some detail, beginning to consider why the writer chose a particular image. | Explaining only one layer of meaning when the image supports multiple readings; Identifying effect in general terms ('it makes the reader feel sad') without precision |
| **Secure** | Analyses figurative language with precision, exploring connotation, semantic fields and the interaction between images, and explaining how figurative devices contribute to the text's overall meaning. | Analysing each image separately without exploring how they interact within the line; Missing the biblical allusion and its implications for characterisation |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates how figurative language operates across a whole text, tracking image patterns, analysing how they develop and change, and assessing their contribution to the text's thematic argument. | Listing examples of blood imagery without tracing its development; Not connecting the image pattern to the play's thematic argument |

### Secondary concept: Dramatic performance understanding (EN-KS3-C024)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Understanding how plays are communicated through performance elements (acting, staging, direction)

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Understands that plays are performed on stage but focuses primarily on the written text without considering performance elements. | Reading plays as if they were novels, ignoring performance dimensions; Not considering how actors, directors and designers interpret the written text |
| **Developing** | Recognises that drama is intended for performance and considers how acting, staging and direction contribute to the audience's experience. | Making directorial suggestions without connecting them to the text's meaning; Focusing only on acting without considering staging, lighting or sound |
| **Secure** | Analyses how performance elements (acting, staging, lighting, sound, set design, blocking) create meaning and how different productions can create different interpretations of the same text. | Describing staging ideas without explaining how they create different interpretations; Assuming there is one 'correct' way to stage a play |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates how specific production choices create interpretive arguments about a play's meaning, and critiques how performance can reveal dimensions of a text that reading alone cannot access. | Describing the production without explaining how the staging choice functions as interpretation; Not connecting the staging choice to specific textual evidence |

### Secondary concept: Alternative staging interpretation (EN-KS3-C025)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Understanding how different staging choices create different interpretations of dramatic texts

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Assumes that there is one correct way to stage a play and does not consider how different interpretive choices might change meaning. | Confusing surface details (costume, set) with deeper interpretive choices; Assuming historical plays must be staged historically |
| **Developing** | Understands that plays can be staged in different ways and that these choices affect interpretation, though may focus on obvious changes like setting or costume. | Describing the change in setting without analysing how it changes meaning; Assuming modernisation always makes a play more accessible |
| **Secure** | Analyses how specific staging choices create distinct interpretations of a play, understanding that every production is an argument about what the text means. | Describing both stagings without reaching an analytical conclusion about how they change meaning; Not considering how the staging choice interacts with other elements of the play |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates how alternative stagings reveal, challenge or extend the play's possible meanings, understanding that interpretation is an active, creative process and that no single staging exhausts a text's possibilities. | Arguing for a controversial staging on grounds of novelty or representation without showing how it illuminates the text; Not grounding the argument in specific textual evidence that supports the staging interpretation |

### Secondary concept: Script rehearsal (EN-KS3-C073)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Practicing and refining performance of dramatic scripts

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Reads scripts aloud without rehearsing or considering how to perform them effectively. | Treating rehearsal as simply reading through the script; Not considering how delivery affects meaning |
| **Developing** | Rehearses scripts with some attention to delivery, experimenting with tone, pace and emphasis to bring the text to life. | Rehearsing only once rather than experimenting with different interpretations; Focusing on individual line delivery without considering the scene as a whole |
| **Secure** | Rehearses scripts purposefully, making and refining interpretive choices about character, pace, emphasis and staging, and using rehearsal to deepen understanding of the text. | Making directorial decisions without connecting them to the text's meaning; Rehearsing performance skills (volume, movement) without considering interpretation |
| **Mastery** | Uses rehearsal as a form of textual analysis, understanding that performing a text is interpreting it, and that the rehearsal process reveals dimensions of meaning that reading alone cannot access. | Reflecting on the performance experience without connecting it to textual meaning; Not recognising that rehearsal is a form of analysis, not just preparation for performance |

## Thinking lens: Continuity and Change Over Time (primary)

**Key question:** What has stayed the same, what has changed, and what drove that change?

**Why this lens fits:** The historical dimension of literary heritage positions literature as a record of changing perspectives over time — pupils trace how literary conventions, themes and forms evolve across different periods.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- Was this change gradual or sudden, and what determined the pace?
- What factors promoted continuity, and what factors drove change?
- How significant was this change — did it affect everyone, or only some?
- How do different historians interpret this period of change?

**Secondary lens:** Perspective and Interpretation — Reading across pre-1914 literature, contemporary fiction, Shakespeare and world literature requires pupils to recognise that texts are products of specific cultural and historical perspectives — understanding a Victorian novel or a Shakespearean play requires reconstructing the perspective from which it was written.

## Session structure: Text Study + Text Study (Literature)

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Text Study (main structure)
A reading-to-writing cycle for primary and KS3 English. Begins with shared or guided reading of a high-quality text, moves through analysis of language features and authorial choices, builds vocabulary, then scaffolds the writing process from planning through drafting to editing and publication.

`shared_reading` → `analysis` → `vocabulary` → `planning` → `drafting` → `editing`

**Assessment:** Final written outcome in the genre studied, demonstrating understanding of text features, appropriate vocabulary use, and effective application of the writing process.

**Teacher note:** Use the TEXT STUDY template: present a text for close reading, guiding analysis of language, structure, and form in relation to purpose and audience. Expect pupils to use precise literary terminology. Support them in crafting their own writing that consciously deploys techniques studied, with structured peer review and editing focused on the impact of specific choices.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How does the writer use language to achieve a specific effect on the reader?
- What is the relationship between the structure of this text and its meaning?
- How effectively have you deployed the technique in your own writing?
- What revision would most improve the impact of your piece?

### Text Study (Literature)
A KS4 literature study sequence designed for GCSE English Literature preparation. Contextualises the text within its literary and historical period, develops close reading skills, applies literary analysis using subject terminology, supports comparison across texts, and scaffolds essay writing in exam-appropriate formats.

`context_setting` → `close_reading` → `literary_analysis` → `comparison` → `essay_writing`

**Assessment:** Timed essay response in GCSE format demonstrating close textual analysis, use of literary terminology, contextual understanding, and structured argument with embedded quotations.

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Drama
**Features to teach:** dramatic comedy conventions (misunderstanding, disguise, resolution through marriage), multiple plot strands and how they interweave (lovers, mechanicals, fairies), verse versus prose as indicators of character status, figurative language in Shakespeare (imagery of nature, magic, and transformation)

**Writing outcome:** Write an analytical paragraph (300-400 words) exploring how Shakespeare uses language to present the theme of love or transformation in A Midsummer Night's Dream, using quotations to support ideas

**Literary terms:** comedy, verse, prose, figurative language, metaphor, dramatic irony, soliloquy, aside, plot strand

---

## Suggested texts

- **A Midsummer Night's Dream** by William Shakespeare — Most accessible Shakespeare comedy for KS3; multiple plot strands sustain engagement across ability range
- **A Midsummer Night's Dream (Cambridge School Shakespeare)** by Rex Gibson (ed.) — Glossed edition with activities for classroom study

---

## Genre

- **Drama:** Dramatic literature studied for its theatrical and literary qualities. Distinct from KS1-KS2 playscript writing: at KS3-KS4, drama means studying published plays as literary texts, analysing dramatic conventions, and understanding performance context. Shakespeare study is the dominant form at KS4.

---

## Why this study matters

A Midsummer Night's Dream is the most widely-taught Shakespeare play at KS3 because its comic plot, magical setting, and multiple storylines are accessible and enjoyable for younger students. The play introduces key dramatic conventions (verse/prose distinction, dramatic irony, multiple plot strands) that prepare students for GCSE Shakespeare study. The comedy genre is less intimidating than tragedy for first encounters with Shakespeare.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Students retell plot rather than analysing how Shakespeare creates effects through language
2. The verse/prose distinction is noticed but not analysed for what it reveals about character and status
3. The fairy world treated as simply entertaining rather than explored for what it reveals about the real world of the play

## Reading and writing skills (KS3)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Word meaning from context** — Understand the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in simple texts by using the surrounding context, including pictures and sentence sense, to make a reasonable guess at what the word means.
- **Information retrieval from simple texts** — Find and report specific information or key facts from a short piece of fiction or non-fiction, identifying the part of the text where the answer is located.
- **Retelling and sequencing** — Retell the main events of a story or the key steps in a non-fiction text, placing them in the correct order and identifying the most important ideas.
- **Simple inference from text** — Use clues in the text — characters' words, actions and feelings — to work out something the author has not stated directly, and begin to explain the reasoning behind that interpretation.
- **Prediction from text clues** — Predict what is likely to happen next in a story or sequence of events, drawing on what has already been read and on prior knowledge of similar texts and situations.
- **Noticing interesting words and phrases** — Identify and discuss words and phrases that capture attention or create an effect, beginning to explain what makes them interesting, surprising or effective in the context of the text.
