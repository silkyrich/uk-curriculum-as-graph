## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Argumentative writing (EN-KS3-C035)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Writing persuasive texts that present claims, evidence, reasoning, and counterarguments

**Teaching guidance:** Teach argument structure explicitly: claim, evidence, reasoning, counter-argument, rebuttal. Use the Toulmin model or a simplified version: 'I believe X because Y, and although some might argue Z, this is unconvincing because...' Teach students to distinguish between assertion (stating a view) and argument (supporting a view with evidence and reasoning). Use debate preparation as a scaffold for argumentative writing. Teach students to vary their argumentative techniques across a piece rather than repeating the same structure.

**Key vocabulary:** argument, claim, evidence, reasoning, counter-argument, rebuttal, assertion, persuade, convince, thesis, logical, rhetorical, ethos, logos, pathos, concession, refutation, discourse marker

**Common misconceptions:** Students frequently confuse assertion with argument — stating opinions forcefully without supporting evidence. Some students present only one side of an argument, not realising that acknowledging and rebutting counter-arguments strengthens their position. Others structure argumentative writing as a list of points rather than a developing, coherent line of reasoning.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Writes arguments that assert opinions without evidence, reasoning or acknowledgement of opposing views. | Write a paragraph arguing that homework should be abolished. | Asserting opinions without supporting evidence; Using emotional language ('it is not fair') rather than reasoned argument |
| **Developing** | Writes arguments with identifiable claims supported by some evidence or reasoning, though the argument may be one-sided and the evidence general. | Write a paragraph arguing that school starting times should be changed. Include at least one piece of evidence. | Citing evidence vaguely ('a study found') without specificity; Not addressing any counter-arguments |
| **Secure** | Writes sustained persuasive arguments with clear claims, specific evidence, logical reasoning, acknowledgement and rebuttal of counter-arguments, and appropriate rhetorical techniques. | Write a letter to your headteacher arguing for a specific change to school policy. Include evidence, acknowledge a counter-argument and rebut it. | Acknowledging a counter-argument without effectively rebutting it; Losing formal register in the more passionate sections of the argument |
| **Mastery** | Writes arguments of genuine persuasive power, with sophisticated structure, compelling evidence, strategic use of rhetoric and a voice that is both authoritative and engaging. | Write an opinion piece for a newspaper arguing a position on a social issue. Your piece should be compelling enough to change minds. | Writing persuasively but without sufficient evidence to convince a sceptical reader; Adopting an aggressive or dismissive tone that alienates rather than persuades |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Homework should be abolished because it is boring and nobody likes doing it. Students already spend all day at school so they should not have to do more work at home. It is not fair.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Schools should start later because research shows that teenagers' body clocks are different from adults'. A study found that adolescents produce melatonin later in the evening, which means they naturally fall asleep later and need to sleep later in the morning. Starting school at 8:30 forces teenagers to learn when their brains are not fully awake. Later start times could improve concentration, attendance and mental health.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *[Writes a formal letter with clear paragraphing, each paragraph making a distinct point supported by evidence. Acknowledges a likely objection ('Some may argue that this would be too expensive, however...') and provides a reasoned rebuttal. Uses formal register appropriate to the audience. Concludes with a specific, actionable request rather than a vague call for change.]*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *[Writes a polished opinion piece with a provocative opening that challenges assumptions, a body that builds the argument through a combination of evidence, anecdote and analysis, strategic concessions that demonstrate fairness while strengthening the overall position, and a conclusion that reframes the debate rather than simply restating the argument. The piece demonstrates awareness of its audience (newspaper readers) and adapts its register, evidence and rhetorical strategy accordingly. The voice is distinctive, confident and persuasive.]*

### Secondary concept: Evidence-based argumentation (EN-KS3-C038)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Supporting ideas and arguments with relevant factual detail and evidence

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Makes claims in writing without supporting them with evidence, or uses only personal experience as evidence. | Relying entirely on personal experience rather than external evidence; Making general claims without specific supporting detail |
| **Developing** | Supports arguments with some factual evidence, including statistics, examples or expert opinions, though evidence may be vague or not fully integrated into the argument. | Citing evidence vaguely ('studies have shown') without specificity; Including evidence without explaining how it supports the specific claim |
| **Secure** | Constructs arguments supported by specific, relevant evidence, integrating factual detail into a logical chain of reasoning that connects claim, evidence and conclusion. | Providing evidence without the reasoning that connects it to the claim; Using evidence that is tangentially relevant rather than directly supporting the argument |
| **Mastery** | Builds sustained, evidenced arguments that evaluate the quality of evidence, address counter-evidence, and construct a persuasive case from multiple types of support (data, expert opinion, case studies, logical reasoning). | Using multiple types of evidence without explaining how they complement each other; Not evaluating the limitations of any individual piece of evidence |

### Secondary concept: Grammatical variety in writing (EN-KS3-C041)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Using diverse grammatical structures purposefully to create effect

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Writes in repetitive sentence patterns, typically using simple or compound sentences, without varying structure for effect. | Joining sentences with 'and' repeatedly rather than using subordination; Not recognising the difference between compound and complex sentences |
| **Developing** | Uses some variety in sentence structure, including complex sentences with subordinate clauses, though may not vary structure purposefully for effect. | Varying sentence structure for its own sake rather than for a specific effect; Using complex sentences that obscure meaning rather than enhancing it |
| **Secure** | Varies sentence structure deliberately and purposefully, using different constructions to control pace, emphasis, rhythm and reader engagement. | Varying structure but not connecting the variation to a specific purpose; Using fragments or short sentences as a default 'tension' technique without considering alternatives |
| **Mastery** | Controls sentence structure with the fluency of an experienced writer, using syntax as a tool for meaning-making that operates alongside vocabulary, imagery and structure. | Creating an effect that the reader can only appreciate if told to look for it; Forcing syntax to mirror content in every sentence, which becomes exhausting rather than effective |

### Secondary concept: Rhetorical devices (EN-KS3-C042)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Using techniques like repetition, rhetorical questions, triads, and emotive language for persuasive effect

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Aware that persuasive techniques exist but uses them randomly or not at all in own writing. | Using rhetorical devices mechanically without understanding their purpose; Deploying a rule of three where the items do not build or develop |
| **Developing** | Uses common rhetorical devices (rhetorical questions, tricolon, emotive language, direct address) with some awareness of their persuasive effect. | Using devices only at the beginning or end rather than throughout; Including so many devices that the argument becomes cluttered |
| **Secure** | Deploys rhetorical devices strategically and with control, understanding how each technique contributes to the overall persuasive structure. | Using anaphora that is repetitive rather than cumulative; Not varying the rhythm and content enough between repetitions to maintain interest |
| **Mastery** | Uses rhetorical devices with the sophistication of a skilled orator, understanding that the most effective rhetoric is invisible -- the audience feels the effect without noticing the technique. | Overusing devices to demonstrate range rather than deploying them for effect; Prioritising technical display over genuine persuasion |

### Secondary concept: Audience awareness in writing (EN-KS3-C044)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Adapting language, tone, and style to suit specific audiences

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Writes without considering who will read the piece, using the same register and tone regardless of the intended audience. | Equating audience awareness with presentation quality rather than content and register; Not distinguishing between different audiences at all |
| **Developing** | Recognises that different audiences require different approaches and makes basic adjustments to vocabulary, formality and content. | Adjusting only vocabulary (simpler or harder words) without also adjusting tone, structure and content; Making audience adjustments only at the start and not sustaining them |
| **Secure** | Adapts all aspects of writing -- vocabulary, sentence structure, tone, content selection, level of formality and rhetorical strategy -- to suit the specific audience, sustaining the adaptation throughout. | Adapting register but not content selection (both versions include the same information); Overdoing the informality for teenage audiences or the formality for official ones |
| **Mastery** | Demonstrates sophisticated audience awareness by constructing texts that anticipate reader responses, challenge reader assumptions, and position the reader strategically. | Manipulating the reader without a clear purpose for doing so; Making the strategic positioning too obvious, which undermines its effectiveness |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Structuring extended writing for formal purposes requires understanding how different essay architectures (chronological, analytical, comparative) serve different purposes — structure is always in service of communicative function.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- How does the structure at this scale enable the function we observe?
- What trade-offs were involved in this structural design?
- How is this structure adapted to solve a specific problem?
- What would you predict about an organism's function from its structure alone?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Formal expository and narrative essays require pupils to plan how evidence and argument will be sequenced — the essay form is the written argument structure, and planning is the process of organising claims and support before drafting.

---

## Session structure: Writer's Workshop

### Writer's Workshop
A process-writing sequence that develops pupils as independent writers. Studies a mentor text to identify craft techniques, practises those techniques in isolation, plans an original piece, drafts with attention to audience and purpose, engages in peer review for feedback, revises and edits, and publishes the final piece.

`mentor_text` → `technique_identification` → `planning` → `drafting` → `peer_review` → `editing` → `publication`

**Assessment:** Final published piece demonstrating identified craft techniques, with writing portfolio showing development through the drafting and revision process.

**Teacher note:** Use the WRITER'S WORKSHOP template: present a mentor text for analysis of craft choices, examining how the writer achieves specific effects on the reader. Guide deliberate practice of identified techniques through planning and drafting. Facilitate structured peer review using clear criteria. Expect pupils to edit with precision, refining sentence structure, vocabulary, and overall cohesion, and to reflect on their development as a writer.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How does the mentor text achieve this effect, and what can you learn from it?
- What deliberate craft choices have you made in your draft, and why?
- What specific improvements did peer review identify, and how will you address them?
- How has your writing developed through this process?

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Non Fiction
**Features to teach:** rhetorical techniques for persuasion (tricolon, anaphora, rhetorical question, direct address, hyperbole), counter-argument and rebuttal — acknowledging and dismantling opposing views, formal register and Standard English in argumentative writing, structural progression from hook to developed argument to powerful conclusion

**Writing outcome:** Write an argumentative essay or speech (500-600 words) on a topical issue, deploying at least three rhetorical techniques, including a counter-argument paragraph, and maintaining formal register throughout

**Literary terms:** rhetoric, anaphora, tricolon, hyperbole, rhetorical question, direct address, counter-argument, rebuttal

---

## Suggested texts

- **I Have a Dream (extract)** by Martin Luther King Jr. — Master class in anaphora, tricolon, and emotional persuasion
- **Malala's UN Speech (extract)** by Malala Yousafzai — Contemporary model; accessible language with powerful rhetorical structure
- **How to Argue with a Racist (extract)** by Adam Rutherford — Evidence-based argumentation model; counter-argument technique

---

## Genre

- **Persuasion:** Texts that argue a single point of view using rhetorical and emotional techniques to convince the reader. Distinct from discussion (which is balanced): persuasion is deliberately one-sided. Teaches pupils to identify and deploy techniques including rhetorical questions, emotive language, repetition, and direct address.
- **Transactional:** Purpose-driven non-fiction forms written for a specific audience and context. The KS3-KS4 progression from KS2 persuasion and discussion: at GCSE, transactional writing encompasses all non-fiction forms (letter, article, speech, review, report) and is assessed on audience awareness, register control, and rhetorical effectiveness. The most frequently examined writing form on GCSE Language Paper 2.

---

## Why this study matters

Persuasive and argumentative writing is the backbone of GCSE English Language Paper 2 Section B, where students must write transactional pieces (speech, article, letter) under timed conditions. Building rhetorical competence across all three years of KS3 ensures students arrive at GCSE with an internalised toolkit of techniques rather than a memorised list. The progression from Y7 (basic rhetorical awareness) to Y9 (sophisticated counter-argument with controlled register) mirrors the demands of the exam.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Rhetorical questions overused as the only persuasive technique — students need a range of devices
2. Counter-argument paragraph is a token 'some people think...' followed by immediate dismissal rather than genuine engagement with opposing views
3. Register inconsistency — essay opens formally then lapses into colloquial language
4. Arguments presented as a list of points rather than building to a cumulative case

## Cross-curricular opportunities

| Link | Subject | Connection | Strength |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| Challenges 1901 to Present Day | History | Historical arguments and speeches — suffrage, civil rights, anti-apartheid as models of persuasive rhetoric | Strong |
| Climate Change: Causes, Evidence and Mitigation | Geography | Environmental issues as stimulus for argumentative writing — climate change, sustainability, resource management | Moderate |

## Reading and writing skills (KS3)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Word meaning from context** — Understand the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in simple texts by using the surrounding context, including pictures and sentence sense, to make a reasonable guess at what the word means.
- **Information retrieval from simple texts** — Find and report specific information or key facts from a short piece of fiction or non-fiction, identifying the part of the text where the answer is located.
- **Retelling and sequencing** — Retell the main events of a story or the key steps in a non-fiction text, placing them in the correct order and identifying the most important ideas.
- **Simple inference from text** — Use clues in the text — characters' words, actions and feelings — to work out something the author has not stated directly, and begin to explain the reasoning behind that interpretation.
- **Prediction from text clues** — Predict what is likely to happen next in a story or sequence of events, drawing on what has already been read and on prior knowledge of similar texts and situations.
- **Noticing interesting words and phrases** — Identify and discuss words and phrases that capture attention or create an effect, beginning to explain what makes them interesting, surprising or effective in the context of the text.
