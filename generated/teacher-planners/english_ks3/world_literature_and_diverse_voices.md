## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: World literature (EN-KS3-C005)

**Type:** Content | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Reading seminal works from diverse cultures and literary traditions beyond British literature

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce world literature through thematic units — a unit on 'journeys' might include texts from different continents. Use dual-language extracts or translations that preserve literary quality. Discuss how cultural context shapes storytelling conventions: oral traditions, magical realism, different narrative structures. Pair world literature with contextual information about the author's cultural background without reducing texts to cultural artefacts.

**Key vocabulary:** world literature, translation, cultural context, oral tradition, narrative convention, magical realism, postcolonial, diaspora, mythology, folklore, universal theme, diverse perspectives

**Common misconceptions:** Students sometimes assume that world literature in translation is automatically 'less literary' than English-language originals. Some students apply Western narrative expectations (linear plot, individual protagonist) to texts from traditions with different conventions.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Has limited experience of literature from beyond the British tradition and may assume that stories from other cultures are fundamentally different from their own. | Read this extract from a Nigerian folk tale. What is the moral of the story? | Treating world literature as exotic curiosities rather than as literature with universal themes; Assuming that translated texts are automatically less literary than English-language originals |
| **Developing** | Engages with texts from different cultures with curiosity and begins to notice how cultural context shapes storytelling conventions. | Compare the way a character is introduced in a European fairy tale and in a West African Anansi story. What do you notice? | Making sweeping generalisations about entire cultures based on one text; Comparing only surface-level differences without considering deeper literary techniques |
| **Secure** | Reads world literature with critical engagement, understanding how different literary traditions use narrative, form and theme, and recognising universal human concerns across cultures. | How does a text from a non-British literary tradition explore a theme that also appears in British literature? Compare the approaches. | Comparing only thematic content without analysing how technique differs across traditions; Assuming one literary tradition is superior to another |
| **Mastery** | Independently seeks out and evaluates world literature, understanding how translation, cultural context and literary tradition shape meaning, and critiquing the idea of a single literary canon. | Should the English curriculum include more world literature? Argue your case with specific examples. | Arguing for inclusion based only on representation rather than also on literary quality and critical value; Treating world literature as a homogeneous category rather than recognising its internal diversity |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *The story is about a tortoise who is greedy and gets punished. The moral is that being greedy leads to bad things happening to you.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *In European fairy tales, characters are often described by their appearance and social role -- 'a beautiful princess' or 'a poor woodcutter'. In the Anansi story, the character is introduced through what they do and how clever they are. Anansi is a trickster who outsmarts others. The European story focuses on what characters look like; the African story focuses on what they are like. This might reflect different cultural values about what matters in a person.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Both Harper Lee's 'To Kill a Mockingbird' (American) and Charles Dickens's 'Oliver Twist' (British) explore the theme of social injustice through the perspective of a child narrator. Lee uses Scout's naive first-person voice to expose racial injustice in the American South -- Scout does not fully understand what she witnesses, which forces the reader to interpret events that the narrator cannot. Dickens uses a more omniscient narrator who describes Oliver's suffering in the workhouse with a satirical tone directed at the reader. The American tradition emphasises individual moral courage (Atticus standing alone), while Dickens emphasises systemic critique (the institutions themselves are corrupt). Both traditions use the innocent child to make injustice visible, but the narrative techniques reflect different literary cultures.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *The English curriculum should include substantially more world literature because the canon currently privileges a narrow slice of human literary achievement. Reading Chinua Achebe's 'Things Fall Apart' alongside Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness' does not just add diversity -- it fundamentally challenges the reader to question whose perspective literature privileges. Achebe's realist depiction of Igbo society directly counters Conrad's symbolic reduction of Africa to a backdrop for European moral crisis. Similarly, reading magical realism from Latin America (Gabriel Garcia Marquez) shows that Western realism is not the only sophisticated way to represent reality -- it is a convention, not a default. The strongest argument for world literature is pedagogical: students who encounter only one tradition develop a narrower analytical toolkit. A student who has read Japanese haiku, West African oral narrative, and Caribbean poetry alongside British canonical texts will have a more flexible and critically aware understanding of what literature can do.*

### Secondary concept: Wide reading breadth (EN-KS3-C001)

**Type:** Content | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Reading across diverse genres, historical periods, forms, and authors including fiction, non-fiction, poetry, and drama

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Reads mostly within a single genre or form (e.g. only fantasy novels) and rarely ventures beyond familiar authors or types of text. | Believing wide reading means reading lots of books, regardless of variety; Not recognising poetry, drama or non-fiction as valid reading choices |
| **Developing** | Reads across two or three genres or forms with some awareness that breadth matters, but needs prompting to try unfamiliar types of text. | Choosing a text from a superficially different genre that is actually very similar (e.g. switching from fantasy to sci-fi); Struggling to articulate what makes one form different from another |
| **Secure** | Reads confidently across fiction, non-fiction, poetry and drama from different periods and traditions, and can explain how different forms offer different reading experiences. | Listing texts from only one period or tradition; Omitting poetry or drama in favour of prose fiction |
| **Mastery** | Independently seeks out challenging and unfamiliar texts across genres, periods and cultures, and reflects critically on how reading breadth shapes their understanding of literature and the world. | Making superficial connections between texts without explaining how the different forms shape understanding; Reflecting only on personal enjoyment rather than on how breadth develops critical insight |

### Secondary concept: Historical and cultural context (EN-KS3-C013)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Understanding texts within their historical, social, and cultural contexts

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Reads texts without considering the historical or cultural conditions in which they were written, treating all texts as if they were written today. | Assuming that historical context is irrelevant to understanding a text; Judging characters' behaviour by modern standards without historical awareness |
| **Developing** | Recognises that historical and cultural context affects a text's meaning and can identify basic contextual information when prompted. | Mentioning context in general terms without connecting it to specific textual details; Treating context as background information rather than as something that shapes meaning |
| **Secure** | Integrates contextual knowledge into textual analysis, explaining how historical, social and cultural conditions shape a writer's choices and a reader's interpretation. | Adding context as a separate paragraph rather than weaving it into textual analysis; Applying only one contextual lens when multiple contexts are relevant |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates how multiple contexts (historical, cultural, biographical, literary) interact to create meaning, and understands that context is itself an interpretive choice -- different contexts produce different readings. | Presenting one contextual reading as the definitive interpretation; Listing contexts without showing how each produces a distinct reading of specific textual details |

### Secondary concept: Characterisation analysis (EN-KS3-C023)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Analyzing how characters are developed through description, dialogue, actions, and relationships

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Describes characters by their physical appearance or basic personality traits but does not analyse how the writer constructs them. | Treating characters as real people rather than as constructions by the writer; Describing personality without using evidence from the text |
| **Developing** | Explains how a character is presented through specific textual details, including what they say, do and how others respond to them. | Relying only on what the writer explicitly tells us rather than analysing indirect characterisation; Not considering how different techniques (dialogue, action, others' reactions) work together |
| **Secure** | Analyses how characters are constructed through multiple techniques, understanding how characterisation develops across a text and how characters serve thematic purposes. | Tracing the character arc without analysing the specific techniques Shakespeare uses; Discussing Lady Macbeth as if she were a real person rather than a dramatic construction |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates how characterisation functions within the text's larger thematic and structural design, analysing how characters relate to each other, to genre conventions and to the writer's moral or political argument. | Arguing that the character is a device without showing how this serves the text's purpose; Not considering whether the character also has elements of psychological realism alongside their structural function |

### Secondary concept: Reading for pleasure habit (EN-KS3-C078)

**Type:** Attitude | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Developing intrinsic motivation to read independently for enjoyment

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Reads only when required to and does not choose to read independently for enjoyment. | Associating reading exclusively with schoolwork rather than personal enjoyment; Not having explored enough genres to find one they enjoy |
| **Developing** | Reads for pleasure occasionally, typically within a narrow range of preferred genres, and can articulate what they enjoy about reading. | Reading only within one genre and not being willing to experiment; Describing enjoyment in terms of ease ('it was easy to read') rather than engagement |
| **Secure** | Reads widely and frequently for pleasure across different genres and forms, and can reflect on what different types of reading offer them. | Describing what they read without reflecting on what different types of reading provide; Not recognising that reading tastes should develop and broaden over time |
| **Mastery** | Has a rich and self-directed reading life, reads for both pleasure and intellectual stimulation, and understands reading as a lifelong practice that shapes thinking and identity. | Making vague claims about reading being 'important' without personal, specific reflection; Focusing only on the content of books rather than on the process and habit of reading |

## Thinking lens: Continuity and Change Over Time (primary)

**Key question:** What has stayed the same, what has changed, and what drove that change?

**Why this lens fits:** The historical dimension of literary heritage positions literature as a record of changing perspectives over time — pupils trace how literary conventions, themes and forms evolve across different periods.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- Was this change gradual or sudden, and what determined the pace?
- What factors promoted continuity, and what factors drove change?
- How significant was this change — did it affect everyone, or only some?
- How do different historians interpret this period of change?

**Secondary lens:** Perspective and Interpretation — Reading across pre-1914 literature, contemporary fiction, Shakespeare and world literature requires pupils to recognise that texts are products of specific cultural and historical perspectives — understanding a Victorian novel or a Shakespearean play requires reconstructing the perspective from which it was written.

## Session structure: Text Study + Text Study (Literature)

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Text Study (main structure)
A reading-to-writing cycle for primary and KS3 English. Begins with shared or guided reading of a high-quality text, moves through analysis of language features and authorial choices, builds vocabulary, then scaffolds the writing process from planning through drafting to editing and publication.

`shared_reading` → `analysis` → `vocabulary` → `planning` → `drafting` → `editing`

**Assessment:** Final written outcome in the genre studied, demonstrating understanding of text features, appropriate vocabulary use, and effective application of the writing process.

**Teacher note:** Use the TEXT STUDY template: present a text for close reading, guiding analysis of language, structure, and form in relation to purpose and audience. Expect pupils to use precise literary terminology. Support them in crafting their own writing that consciously deploys techniques studied, with structured peer review and editing focused on the impact of specific choices.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How does the writer use language to achieve a specific effect on the reader?
- What is the relationship between the structure of this text and its meaning?
- How effectively have you deployed the technique in your own writing?
- What revision would most improve the impact of your piece?

### Text Study (Literature)
A KS4 literature study sequence designed for GCSE English Literature preparation. Contextualises the text within its literary and historical period, develops close reading skills, applies literary analysis using subject terminology, supports comparison across texts, and scaffolds essay writing in exam-appropriate formats.

`context_setting` → `close_reading` → `literary_analysis` → `comparison` → `essay_writing`

**Assessment:** Timed essay response in GCSE format demonstrating close textual analysis, use of literary terminology, contextual understanding, and structured argument with embedded quotations.

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Fiction
**Features to teach:** how cultural context shapes narrative voice, setting, and theme, comparing how writers from different traditions represent identity, heritage, and social experience, understanding the concept of 'literary heritage' as a living, evolving canon that includes diverse voices, close reading of unfamiliar styles and structures — developing reading resilience with varied literary traditions

**Writing outcome:** Write a comparative analytical essay (400-500 words) exploring how two writers from different cultural traditions present ideas about identity or heritage, analysing how cultural context shapes language and narrative choices

**Literary terms:** postcolonial, cultural context, narrative voice, perspective, diaspora, identity, heritage, literary canon

---

## Suggested texts

- **Things Fall Apart (extract)** by Chinua Achebe — Foundational postcolonial novel; pre-colonial Igbo culture presented on its own terms
- **The House on Mango Street (selected vignettes)** by Sandra Cisneros — Accessible short form; Chicana identity and coming-of-age in urban America
- **A Long Walk to Water** by Linda Sue Park — Dual timeline; Sudanese setting with accessible narrative structure
- **Anita and Me (extract)** by Meera Syal — British-Asian identity in 1970s England; humour and social commentary

---

## Genre

- **Literary Fiction:** Prose fiction studied analytically for its literary qualities rather than simply read for plot. The progression from KS2 narrative: at KS3-KS4, fiction becomes an object of critical study where students analyse how authors construct meaning through language, structure, and form. Includes both reading (textual analysis) and writing (creative composition).

---

## Why this study matters

The NC requires study of 'works from other cultures and traditions' alongside the English literary heritage. This unit ensures students encounter a genuinely diverse range of writers — not as tokenistic additions but as central literary voices with their own traditions, conventions, and concerns. Studying Achebe, Cisneros, or Syal alongside the English literary heritage develops critical understanding of how cultural context shapes writing and challenges the assumption that 'great literature' comes only from one tradition. The comparative element builds the analytical skills needed at GCSE.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Texts from other cultures treated as sociological documents ('this teaches us about life in Nigeria') rather than as literary works to be analysed for craft and technique
2. Comparative work defaults to comparing cultures rather than comparing how writers use language and structure
3. Only one non-English text studied as a token gesture rather than building a genuinely diverse reading diet across KS3
4. Teachers unfamiliar with the cultural context avoid discussing it rather than researching and presenting it accurately

## Cross-curricular opportunities

| Link | Subject | Connection | Strength |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| Ideas, Power, Industry and Empire 1745-1901 | History | Postcolonial contexts — how colonial history shapes the literature of formerly colonised nations | Strong |
| Africa: Place Depth Study | Geography | African literature and the geographical study of Africa — understanding place through fiction and non-fiction | Moderate |

---

## Reading and writing skills (KS3)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Word meaning from context** — Understand the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in simple texts by using the surrounding context, including pictures and sentence sense, to make a reasonable guess at what the word means.
- **Information retrieval from simple texts** — Find and report specific information or key facts from a short piece of fiction or non-fiction, identifying the part of the text where the answer is located.
- **Retelling and sequencing** — Retell the main events of a story or the key steps in a non-fiction text, placing them in the correct order and identifying the most important ideas.
- **Simple inference from text** — Use clues in the text — characters' words, actions and feelings — to work out something the author has not stated directly, and begin to explain the reasoning behind that interpretation.
- **Prediction from text clues** — Predict what is likely to happen next in a story or sequence of events, drawing on what has already been read and on prior knowledge of similar texts and situations.
- **Noticing interesting words and phrases** — Identify and discuss words and phrases that capture attention or create an effect, beginning to explain what makes them interesting, surprising or effective in the context of the text.
