## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Poetry composition (EN-KS3-C033)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Writing original poems using poetic devices, forms, and techniques

**Teaching guidance:** Teach poetry writing through reading and imitating published poets. Use constraint-based writing exercises: write a poem using only questions, write a poem with exactly ten words per line, write a poem that starts and ends with the same word. Teach students that poetry is about making deliberate choices with every word and line break. Encourage experimentation with form — try sonnets, haiku, free verse, acrostic — and discuss how form shapes content. Workshop poems through peer feedback and revision.

**Key vocabulary:** poem, verse, stanza, line break, enjambment, end-stopping, imagery, figurative language, rhyme, rhythm, free verse, sonnet, haiku, voice, tone, draft, revision, word choice

**Common misconceptions:** Students often believe poetry must rhyme, producing forced rhymes that distort meaning. Some students write prose broken into short lines and call it poetry, without making deliberate choices about lineation. Others view poetry writing as spontaneous expression rather than crafted composition, resisting the revision process.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Writes verse that uses rhyme as the primary organising principle, often at the expense of meaning, with limited control of form or imagery. | Write a short poem about a place that is important to you. | Forcing rhymes that distort meaning or produce awkward phrasing; Writing in a sing-song rhythm that does not serve the poem's content |
| **Developing** | Writes poems that use imagery and some poetic devices, with growing control of line breaks and an understanding that poetry is about more than rhyme. | Write a poem about an everyday object, using imagery to make the reader see it differently. | Including imagery that does not serve the poem's overall meaning; Using line breaks randomly rather than for deliberate effect |
| **Secure** | Writes poems with deliberate control of form, imagery, voice and line, understanding how poetic techniques create specific effects and making choices that serve the poem's meaning. | Write a poem that uses a specific poetic form (sonnet, villanelle, free verse with a structural pattern) deliberately. | Choosing a form without considering how it relates to the poem's content; Sacrificing meaning to maintain the formal pattern |
| **Mastery** | Writes poetry of genuine quality, with original voice, precise and surprising imagery, and structural choices that create layers of meaning. | Write a poem that uses an extended metaphor sustained across at least 12 lines. | Allowing the extended metaphor to become predictable or mechanical; Using imagery that is decorative rather than illuminating |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *My room is where I like to be / It is the place that is just for me / I sit and play and have some fun / Until the day is almost done.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *The Kettle
It sits, squat and patient,
A silver Buddha on the worktop,
Humming its morning mantra
Until it screams --
Brief, furious, then silent.
Steam ghosts rise and vanish
Like ideas you almost had
Before the day swallowed them.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *[Writes a poem in a chosen form where the form itself contributes to meaning -- for example, a poem about restriction written in a strict form to mirror the feeling of constraint, or a poem about freedom in expanding free verse stanzas. The imagery is precise and original, the voice is distinctive, and the line breaks are purposeful. The poem demonstrates understanding that form is not decoration but meaning.]*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *[Writes a poem where a single metaphor is developed with increasing complexity across the whole piece. The metaphor opens with a clear comparison, extends through specific and surprising details, and arrives at a conclusion that transforms the reader's understanding of both the subject and the image. The language is precise -- every word earns its place. The poem demonstrates that the writer understands poetry as a form of thinking, not just a form of expression.]*

### Secondary concept: Poetic device analysis (EN-KS3-C020)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Analyzing how poetic devices (imagery, sound patterns, enjambment) create meaning and effect

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Identifies obvious poetic devices (rhyme, alliteration) but cannot explain their effect beyond saying the poem 'sounds nice'. | Identifying a device without explaining its specific effect in context; Using vague evaluative language ('sounds nice', 'flows well') instead of precise analysis |
| **Developing** | Analyses the effect of poetic devices with some detail, beginning to connect sound, imagery and structure to meaning. | Describing enjambment as simply 'the sentence continues onto the next line' without explaining the effect of the specific break point; Not considering how enjambment interacts with other devices in the poem |
| **Secure** | Analyses how multiple poetic devices interact to create layered effects, connecting sound, imagery, structure and meaning with precision. | Analysing sound and imagery separately without exploring how they work together; Identifying the atmosphere without explaining precisely how the combination of devices creates it |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates how poetic devices function within the total design of a poem, assessing how technique serves the poet's thematic and emotional argument across the entire work. | Choosing a technique that is incidental rather than central to the poem's meaning; Describing how the technique works without arguing why it is essential to the poem's thematic purpose |

### Secondary concept: Vocabulary refinement (EN-KS3-C047)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Selecting more precise, sophisticated, or effective vocabulary during revision

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Does not revise vocabulary during editing, accepting the first word that comes to mind as sufficient. | Not recognising that vocabulary can be improved during revision; Replacing words with synonyms of equal vagueness |
| **Developing** | Identifies vague or repetitive vocabulary during revision and replaces it with more precise alternatives when prompted. | Using a thesaurus to find impressive words without checking they fit the context; Reducing repetition but not increasing precision |
| **Secure** | Refines vocabulary independently during revision, selecting words that are more precise, more evocative or better suited to the register and purpose of the writing. | Making changes that improve individual words but not the overall effect; Not considering how individual word changes affect the surrounding sentences |
| **Mastery** | Refines vocabulary with the rigour and sensitivity of a professional writer, understanding that the right word in the right place can transform a piece of writing. | Over-revising to the point where the writing loses its natural voice; Being able to revise vocabulary but not to explain why the revisions matter |

### Secondary concept: Script and poetry performance (EN-KS3-C074)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Performing dramatic and poetic texts with appropriate expression and technique

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Performs scripts and poetry by reading aloud in a flat, unexpressive manner without considering how delivery affects meaning. | Reading rather than performing; Not varying tone, pace or volume |
| **Developing** | Performs with some expression, varying tone and pace and attempting to convey the mood and meaning of the text. | Over-acting (shouting for anger, whispering for sadness) rather than using subtle vocal variation; Performing the emotions without conveying the meaning of the words |
| **Secure** | Performs scripts and poetry with skill and sensitivity, using vocal and physical techniques to convey meaning, mood and character effectively. | Using vocal techniques for effect without grounding them in the text's meaning; Performing well technically but without emotional authenticity |
| **Mastery** | Performs with the skill and interpretive intelligence of a trained performer, making deliberate choices that create a specific reading of the text and communicate complex meaning to the audience. | Creating two performances that differ in energy but not in interpretation; Not being able to explain how specific delivery choices create different meanings |

### Secondary concept: Performance techniques (EN-KS3-C075)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Using role, intonation, tone, volume, mood, silence, stillness, and action to enhance performance

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Performs without awareness of how physical and vocal techniques affect the audience's experience. | Knowing only volume as a variable; Not considering stillness, silence or subtlety as performance tools |
| **Developing** | Uses some performance techniques including changes in volume, pace, gesture and facial expression to enhance delivery. | Applying techniques mechanically rather than organically; Using too many techniques at once, creating a cluttered performance |
| **Secure** | Uses a range of performance techniques with control and purpose, understanding how intonation, tone, volume, pace, silence, stillness, gesture and movement create specific effects on the audience. | Using silence and stillness as techniques without understanding their specific effect; Not trusting that the audience can read subtlety |
| **Mastery** | Performs with the full range of theatrical techniques at their command, making sophisticated choices about when to use restraint and when to use intensity, and understanding how performance techniques serve the text's meaning. | Treating the restriction as a gimmick rather than as an analytical exercise; Not reflecting on what the restriction revealed about the relationship between text and performance |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Structuring extended writing for formal purposes requires understanding how different essay architectures (chronological, analytical, comparative) serve different purposes — structure is always in service of communicative function.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- How does the structure at this scale enable the function we observe?
- What trade-offs were involved in this structural design?
- How is this structure adapted to solve a specific problem?
- What would you predict about an organism's function from its structure alone?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Formal expository and narrative essays require pupils to plan how evidence and argument will be sequenced — the essay form is the written argument structure, and planning is the process of organising claims and support before drafting.

---

## Session structure: Creative Response + Performance

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Creative Response (main structure)
A creative arts or writing sequence that develops technique through exposure to exemplary work, guided exploration of techniques, structured planning, independent creation, and peer critique. Balances creative freedom with technical skill development.

`exemplar_exposure` → `technique_exploration` → `planning` → `creating` → `critique`

**Assessment:** Final creative outcome (artwork, design, written piece) accompanied by a reflective evaluation discussing techniques used, influences, and areas for development.

**Teacher note:** Use the CREATIVE RESPONSE template: present exemplars from diverse traditions and guide critical analysis of technique, context, and meaning. Expect pupils to experiment with techniques, document their creative process, and produce work that demonstrates informed artistic or literary choices. Facilitate structured critique using subject-specific terminology and assessment criteria.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How does the context of this work influence its meaning?
- What techniques will you experiment with, and how do they serve your intention?
- How does your creative process connect to the exemplars you studied?
- What specific aspects of your work would you refine, and why?

### Performance
A sequence building towards a culminating performance in music, drama, or physical activity. Pupils study repertoire or material, develop technical skills through focused practice, rehearse with attention to expression and communication, perform to an audience (real or virtual), and evaluate their own and others' performances.

`repertoire_study` → `technique_development` → `rehearsal` → `performance` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Performance assessed against subject-specific criteria (musical accuracy, expression, dramatic impact, physical skill execution) plus reflective self-evaluation.

**Teacher note:** Use the PERFORMANCE template: analyse repertoire or performance material in terms of style, structure, and technique. Develop skills through targeted exercises and progressively challenging practice. Guide independent and ensemble rehearsal with attention to interpretation, expression, and technical precision. Facilitate critical evaluation of performance using subject-specific criteria.

**KS3 question stems:**
- What stylistic and technical features define this piece or performance?
- How will you target your practice to address your weaknesses?
- What interpretive choices have you made, and how do they affect the performance?
- How would you evaluate your performance against the assessment criteria?

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Poetry
**Features to teach:** experimenting with poetic form (free verse, sonnet, ballad, spoken word) and understanding how form shapes meaning, sound patterning in poetry (rhythm, rhyme, alliteration, assonance) and its effect on a listener, drafting and redrafting poetry — treating poetry as craft that can be revised and improved, performance techniques (pace, pause, emphasis, eye contact, gesture) for spoken word delivery

**Writing outcome:** Write a poem (12-30 lines) in a chosen form on a theme of personal significance, then rehearse and deliver a spoken word performance to the class, demonstrating conscious use of pace, pause, and emphasis

**Literary terms:** free verse, spoken word, rhythm, rhyme scheme, alliteration, assonance, refrain, stanza

---

## Suggested texts

- **The Hill We Climb** by Amanda Gorman — Contemporary spoken word with powerful performance element; accessible entry to performance poetry
- **Still I Rise** by Maya Angelou — Strong rhythm and refrain; excellent performance poem with powerful message
- **Cautionary Tales for Children** by Hilaire Belloc — Formal verse with humour; accessible form for own composition experiments

---

## Genre

- **Poetry:** Literature using rhythm, imagery, and condensed language to convey meaning and emotion. Poetry is continuous across all key stages with no progression break, but expectations increase: from recitation and simple pattern-following (KS1) through multiple forms and figurative language (KS2) to analysis of poetic conventions and unseen poetry comparison (KS4).

---

## Why this study matters

Poetry composition and performance is the creative counterpart to the analytical poetry units. Writing poetry develops students' awareness of how every word choice, line break, and sound pattern carries meaning — an awareness that directly improves their analytical reading of other poets' work. The spoken word performance element connects poetry to its oral roots and develops the oracy skills that underpin the Spoken Language Endorsement at GCSE. Students who have written and performed their own poetry approach analytical poetry study with deeper understanding of craft.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Poetry writing treated as a frivolous 'fun' activity rather than a rigorous craft exercise with genuine learning outcomes
2. Students default to rhyming couplets because they think 'real poetry rhymes' — need exposure to free verse and spoken word
3. Performance is mumbled reading-aloud rather than genuine spoken word delivery with pace, pause, and emphasis
4. No drafting process — first draft treated as final draft without revision

---

## Reading and writing skills (KS3)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Word meaning from context** — Understand the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in simple texts by using the surrounding context, including pictures and sentence sense, to make a reasonable guess at what the word means.
- **Information retrieval from simple texts** — Find and report specific information or key facts from a short piece of fiction or non-fiction, identifying the part of the text where the answer is located.
- **Retelling and sequencing** — Retell the main events of a story or the key steps in a non-fiction text, placing them in the correct order and identifying the most important ideas.
- **Simple inference from text** — Use clues in the text — characters' words, actions and feelings — to work out something the author has not stated directly, and begin to explain the reasoning behind that interpretation.
- **Prediction from text clues** — Predict what is likely to happen next in a story or sequence of events, drawing on what has already been read and on prior knowledge of similar texts and situations.
- **Noticing interesting words and phrases** — Identify and discuss words and phrases that capture attention or create an effect, beginning to explain what makes them interesting, surprising or effective in the context of the text.
