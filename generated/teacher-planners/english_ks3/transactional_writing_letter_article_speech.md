## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Letter writing (personal/formal) (EN-KS3-C036)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Writing letters in both personal and formal registers with appropriate conventions

**Teaching guidance:** Teach the conventions of formal and informal letters explicitly: layout (address, date, greeting, sign-off), register differences, and purpose-driven content. Use real-world letter-writing tasks — letters to the headteacher, to a newspaper editor, to a fictional character. Compare formal and informal letters on the same topic to highlight how register shapes language choices. Teach students that even informal letters have conventions and structure. Practise email as a modern form of letter writing with its own conventions.

**Key vocabulary:** letter, formal letter, informal letter, greeting, salutation, sign-off, yours faithfully, yours sincerely, register, address, date, recipient, purpose, tone, layout, convention, paragraph structure

**Common misconceptions:** Students often mix formal and informal register within the same letter. Some students confuse 'Yours faithfully' (unknown recipient) with 'Yours sincerely' (named recipient). Others neglect to adapt their content and language to the specific audience, writing the same way regardless of whether they are addressing a friend or a council official.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Writes letters without clear awareness of the conventions of the form or the need to adapt register to audience. | Write a formal letter to a local councillor about an issue in your area. | Using informal register in a formal letter ('really rubbish', 'sort it out'); Not following letter conventions (no address, no date, informal sign-off) |
| **Developing** | Writes letters with appropriate conventions (address, date, salutation, sign-off) and attempts to match register to audience, though may lapse between formal and informal. | Write a formal letter complaining about poor service at a local business. | Mixing formal and informal register within the same letter; Stating the complaint without explaining what resolution is expected |
| **Secure** | Writes letters in both personal and formal registers with confident control of conventions, tone and purpose, adapting all aspects of the writing to the audience. | Write a formal letter to a company CEO requesting sponsorship for a school event, and a personal letter to a friend describing the same event. Notice how your language changes. | Writing the formal letter well but making the personal letter too similar in tone; Not adapting vocabulary, sentence structure and tone to the different audiences |
| **Mastery** | Writes letters with sophisticated control of voice, register and persuasive strategy, adapting the form to serve complex communicative purposes. | Write a letter to a newspaper editor responding to an article you disagree with. Your letter should be persuasive, reasoned and likely to be published. | Writing a response that is too long for the conventions of newspaper letters; Attacking the writer rather than the argument |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Dear Councillor, I am writing to say that our park is really rubbish and needs fixing. The swings are broken and there is litter everywhere. Please sort it out. Thanks, [name]*

> **Model response (Developing):** *[Writes a letter with correct formatting, opening with 'Dear Sir/Madam', stating the complaint clearly, providing specific details, and closing with 'Yours faithfully'. The register is mostly formal but may include informal phrases. The letter states the complaint but may not specify a desired outcome.]*

> **Model response (Secure):** *[Writes two contrasting letters about the same topic. The formal letter uses correct business format, formal register, a professional tone, specific evidence of the event's value, and a clear request with proposed benefits for the sponsor. The personal letter uses warm, informal language, humour, personal asides and a conversational tone. Both letters are effective for their audience, demonstrating that the student can control register consciously.]*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *[Writes a concise, compelling letter that opens by referencing the specific article, states a clear position, provides evidence and reasoning, uses the formal but accessible register appropriate for a newspaper's letters page, and closes with a memorable point. The letter demonstrates awareness that published letters are edited for space and impact, so every sentence is purposeful. The tone is firm but respectful, disagreeing with the article's argument rather than attacking the writer personally.]*

### Secondary concept: Presentation script writing (EN-KS3-C034)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Writing effective notes and polished scripts for oral presentations and talks

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Writes presentation notes that are essentially full scripts to be read aloud, without considering the differences between written and spoken communication. | Writing a full script rather than structured notes; Not considering how spoken delivery differs from reading |
| **Developing** | Writes structured presentation notes with key points, some spoken language features (direct address, rhetorical questions) and a clear organisational plan. | Writing notes that are too detailed to be used flexibly; Including spoken language features only in the opening and losing them in the body |
| **Secure** | Writes polished presentation scripts or structured notes that use rhetorical technique, audience engagement strategies and a clear spoken voice, understanding the conventions of effective oral communication. | Writing a speech that reads well on paper but would be difficult to deliver; Overusing rhetorical devices so they lose impact |
| **Mastery** | Writes presentations and speeches that demonstrate sophisticated understanding of how spoken language works differently from written language, crafting text that is designed for oral impact. | Writing text that works on the page but does not account for the temporal nature of listening; Not considering how pauses, emphasis and vocal delivery interact with the written text |

### Secondary concept: Form selection (EN-KS3-C039)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Selecting appropriate text forms based on purpose, audience, and context

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Writes in a default essay or story form regardless of what the task requires, without considering which form best suits the purpose. | Defaulting to 'essay' format for every writing task; Not recognising that different forms have different conventions and effects |
| **Developing** | Recognises that different forms serve different purposes and can select an appropriate form when given options, though may not apply its conventions consistently. | Choosing an appropriate form but not applying its specific conventions; Confusing the conventions of similar forms (e.g. article vs report) |
| **Secure** | Selects form confidently based on purpose, audience and context, and applies the conventions of the chosen form accurately to enhance the writing's effectiveness. | Changing content between forms rather than changing technique and convention; Not sustaining the chosen form's conventions throughout the piece |
| **Mastery** | Makes sophisticated choices about form, understanding that form itself carries meaning and that unconventional form choices can enhance a text's impact. | Choosing an unusual form for novelty rather than because it enhances meaning; Not explaining how the form choice serves the message |

### Secondary concept: Audience awareness in writing (EN-KS3-C044)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Adapting language, tone, and style to suit specific audiences

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Writes without considering who will read the piece, using the same register and tone regardless of the intended audience. | Equating audience awareness with presentation quality rather than content and register; Not distinguishing between different audiences at all |
| **Developing** | Recognises that different audiences require different approaches and makes basic adjustments to vocabulary, formality and content. | Adjusting only vocabulary (simpler or harder words) without also adjusting tone, structure and content; Making audience adjustments only at the start and not sustaining them |
| **Secure** | Adapts all aspects of writing -- vocabulary, sentence structure, tone, content selection, level of formality and rhetorical strategy -- to suit the specific audience, sustaining the adaptation throughout. | Adapting register but not content selection (both versions include the same information); Overdoing the informality for teenage audiences or the formality for official ones |
| **Mastery** | Demonstrates sophisticated audience awareness by constructing texts that anticipate reader responses, challenge reader assumptions, and position the reader strategically. | Manipulating the reader without a clear purpose for doing so; Making the strategic positioning too obvious, which undermines its effectiveness |

### Secondary concept: Purpose awareness in writing (EN-KS3-C045)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Shaping writing to achieve specific purposes (inform, persuade, entertain, explain)

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Writes without a clear sense of purpose, producing text that does not consistently inform, persuade, entertain or explain. | Not having a clear purpose before beginning to write; Mixing purposes inconsistently within a single piece |
| **Developing** | Identifies the purpose of their writing and makes some adjustments to approach, though purpose may not be sustained throughout the piece. | Beginning with a clear purpose but drifting into a different one; Not recognising when their writing has shifted purpose |
| **Secure** | Writes with sustained awareness of purpose, making consistent choices about content, tone, evidence and structure that serve the intended aim throughout the piece. | Allowing the secondary purpose to overwhelm the primary one; Not being able to articulate what the secondary purpose is or how it is achieved |
| **Mastery** | Controls purpose with sophistication, understanding that the most effective writing often achieves multiple purposes simultaneously and that purpose can shift strategically within a single piece. | Making the shift too abrupt, jarring the reader; Not signalling the shift clearly enough for the reader to follow |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Structuring extended writing for formal purposes requires understanding how different essay architectures (chronological, analytical, comparative) serve different purposes — structure is always in service of communicative function.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- How does the structure at this scale enable the function we observe?
- What trade-offs were involved in this structural design?
- How is this structure adapted to solve a specific problem?
- What would you predict about an organism's function from its structure alone?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Formal expository and narrative essays require pupils to plan how evidence and argument will be sequenced — the essay form is the written argument structure, and planning is the process of organising claims and support before drafting.

---

## Session structure: Writer's Workshop

### Writer's Workshop
A process-writing sequence that develops pupils as independent writers. Studies a mentor text to identify craft techniques, practises those techniques in isolation, plans an original piece, drafts with attention to audience and purpose, engages in peer review for feedback, revises and edits, and publishes the final piece.

`mentor_text` → `technique_identification` → `planning` → `drafting` → `peer_review` → `editing` → `publication`

**Assessment:** Final published piece demonstrating identified craft techniques, with writing portfolio showing development through the drafting and revision process.

**Teacher note:** Use the WRITER'S WORKSHOP template: present a mentor text for analysis of craft choices, examining how the writer achieves specific effects on the reader. Guide deliberate practice of identified techniques through planning and drafting. Facilitate structured peer review using clear criteria. Expect pupils to edit with precision, refining sentence structure, vocabulary, and overall cohesion, and to reflect on their development as a writer.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How does the mentor text achieve this effect, and what can you learn from it?
- What deliberate craft choices have you made in your draft, and why?
- What specific improvements did peer review identify, and how will you address them?
- How has your writing developed through this process?

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Non Fiction
**Features to teach:** form conventions specific to letters, articles, and speeches (layout, salutation, headline, direct address), adapting register and tone for different audiences (formal letter versus newspaper article versus spoken address), structural organisation within each form (topic sentences, paragraph transitions, conclusion), purpose-driven writing — how intended effect shapes every language and structural choice

**Writing outcome:** Write two transactional pieces in different forms (400-500 words each): a formal letter to an authority figure AND a newspaper article or speech on the same issue, demonstrating how form and audience shape register and structural choices

**Literary terms:** register, tone, formal, audience, purpose, convention, headline, salutation

---

## Suggested texts

- **Letters from a war zone (Imperial War Museum collection)** by various — Authentic letters showing how form shapes voice; connects to history
- **First News (selected articles)** by various — Age-appropriate journalism modelling article conventions

---

## Genre

- **Transactional:** Purpose-driven non-fiction forms written for a specific audience and context. The KS3-KS4 progression from KS2 persuasion and discussion: at GCSE, transactional writing encompasses all non-fiction forms (letter, article, speech, review, report) and is assessed on audience awareness, register control, and rhetorical effectiveness. The most frequently examined writing form on GCSE Language Paper 2.

---

## Why this study matters

Transactional writing at KS3 bridges the gap between KS2 persuasion and discussion and the GCSE Language Paper 2 writing task, where students must write in a specified form for a specified audience. Teaching multiple forms together (letter, article, speech) develops the crucial skill of adapting register and structural conventions to form — rather than writing everything in the same generic 'essay' style. Y7-Y8 is the right time to establish these conventions so that Y9 can focus on sophistication and exam readiness.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. All three forms written in the same style without adapting register for the different audiences
2. Formal letter opens with 'I am writing to you...' rather than establishing the issue immediately and compellingly
3. Article lacks clear headline and uses personal essay register rather than journalistic style
4. Structural conventions (salutation, sign-off, headline, subheadings) forgotten or inconsistent

## Cross-curricular opportunities

| Link | Subject | Connection | Strength |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| Climate Change: Causes, Evidence and Mitigation | Geography | Writing about real-world issues — climate change, sustainability, resource management as stimulus for transactional writing | Moderate |

## Reading and writing skills (KS3)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Word meaning from context** — Understand the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in simple texts by using the surrounding context, including pictures and sentence sense, to make a reasonable guess at what the word means.
- **Information retrieval from simple texts** — Find and report specific information or key facts from a short piece of fiction or non-fiction, identifying the part of the text where the answer is located.
- **Retelling and sequencing** — Retell the main events of a story or the key steps in a non-fiction text, placing them in the correct order and identifying the most important ideas.
- **Simple inference from text** — Use clues in the text — characters' words, actions and feelings — to work out something the author has not stated directly, and begin to explain the reasoning behind that interpretation.
- **Prediction from text clues** — Predict what is likely to happen next in a story or sequence of events, drawing on what has already been read and on prior knowledge of similar texts and situations.
- **Noticing interesting words and phrases** — Identify and discuss words and phrases that capture attention or create an effect, beginning to explain what makes them interesting, surprising or effective in the context of the text.
