## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Creative story writing (EN-KS3-C031)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Writing imaginative narratives with developed characters, settings, and plot

**Teaching guidance:** Teach creative writing as craft, not inspiration. Use mentor texts to analyse how published authors create effective openings, build character, establish setting, and control pacing. Provide structured planning tools: character profiles, setting maps, plot arcs. Teach students to 'show not tell' — using action, dialogue, and sensory detail rather than direct statement. Use short writing exercises (micro-fiction, 100-word stories) to develop specific skills before attempting longer pieces.

**Key vocabulary:** narrative, creative writing, character, setting, plot, conflict, dialogue, show not tell, sensory detail, pacing, tension, climax, resolution, first person, third person, voice, opening hook

**Common misconceptions:** Students often over-plot their stories, cramming in too many events at the expense of language quality. Some students believe creative writing cannot be taught — that it requires innate talent rather than learnable craft. Others write entirely in telling mode ('She was sad') rather than showing emotion through action and detail ('She turned away, pressing her nails into her palm').

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Writes stories that focus on what happens (plot events) without developing character, setting or language, often rushing to a conclusion. | Write the opening of a story set in an unfamiliar place. | Telling what happens without showing it through descriptive detail; Introducing too many events without developing any one of them |
| **Developing** | Writes stories with some development of character, setting and atmosphere, using descriptive language and basic narrative techniques like dialogue. | Write the opening of a story that creates a sense of mystery. | Creating atmosphere in the opening but abandoning it once the plot starts; Using cliched imagery ('it was a dark and stormy night') |
| **Secure** | Writes creative fiction with deliberate control of narrative technique, including character voice, atmospheric description, pacing and structural choices. | Write a story opening that establishes character through voice rather than description. | Establishing a distinctive voice in the opening but not sustaining it; Over-explaining the character's feelings rather than letting voice reveal them |
| **Mastery** | Writes creative fiction of genuine literary quality, with original voice, controlled structure, precise imagery and thematic resonance. | Write a complete short story (400-500 words) that uses a single image or object as a unifying device. | Using the unifying device mechanically rather than allowing its significance to develop naturally; Prioritising literary technique over emotional truth |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *One day a boy went to a strange land. It was really weird and different. He met a girl who said she could help him. They went on an adventure together.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *The house had been empty for years. That was what everyone said, and that was what I believed until the night I saw the light. It was small -- just a flicker in the upstairs window, there and gone like a firefly. I stood on the pavement, my breath making ghosts in the cold air, and told myself it was a reflection. But reflections do not move from room to room.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *The thing about Tuesdays is that nobody expects anything from them. Mondays are for dread, Wednesdays for endurance, Fridays for relief. But Tuesdays? Tuesdays just happen to you. Which is why, when Mrs Patterson asked me to stay behind after maths, I did not feel anxious or curious or anything at all. It was a Tuesday. Whatever she wanted would be small, forgettable, a footnote in a day designed for footnotes. I was wrong about that. I was wrong about most things that term, but this was the wrongness that mattered.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *[Writes a complete short story where a single object (e.g. a pair of shoes, a photograph, a key) appears at the beginning, middle and end, each time carrying different significance as the narrative develops. The prose is precise and controlled, with imagery that serves characterisation and theme rather than decoration. The story has a clear arc but avoids neat resolution, trusting the reader to infer meaning. Voice is distinctive and sustained throughout.]*

### Secondary concept: Formal narrative essay (EN-KS3-C029)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Writing structured narrative essays with clear story elements and academic tone

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Writes narratives that focus on plot events in chronological order without developing character, setting or reflective commentary. | Telling events in order without developing any single moment in depth; Stating the lesson explicitly rather than allowing it to emerge from the narrative |
| **Developing** | Writes narrative essays with some development of character, setting and reflective commentary, using basic narrative techniques. | Including too many events rather than developing a single significant moment; Using reflective commentary that tells the reader what to think rather than showing it through narrative |
| **Secure** | Writes narrative essays that combine vivid storytelling with reflective analysis, using narrative technique deliberately to structure the reader's experience. | Developing the reflective insight without grounding it in specific sensory detail; Making the reflection too abstract or philosophical, losing the narrative voice |
| **Mastery** | Writes narrative essays of literary quality, integrating storytelling and reflection seamlessly, with precise control of voice, structure and imagery. | Using structural devices for their own sake rather than to enhance meaning; Losing the personal voice in pursuit of literary technique |

### Secondary concept: Sophisticated vocabulary use (EN-KS3-C040)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Applying advanced vocabulary precisely and effectively in writing

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Uses basic, repetitive vocabulary in writing, relying on common words and not attempting to deploy more precise or sophisticated alternatives. | Replacing a vague word with another equally vague word; Adding intensifiers ('really', 'very') instead of choosing a more precise word |
| **Developing** | Uses some sophisticated vocabulary in writing, selecting more precise words when prompted, though may use advanced vocabulary incorrectly or inconsistently. | Using sophisticated words incorrectly because the precise meaning is not understood; Forcing in advanced vocabulary where simpler words would be more effective |
| **Secure** | Selects vocabulary with precision and confidence, choosing words for their specific meaning, connotation and register rather than for impressiveness. | Using sophisticated vocabulary as decoration rather than as a tool for precision; Not maintaining consistent vocabulary choices that serve the same characterisation |
| **Mastery** | Deploys vocabulary with the precision and originality of a skilled writer, understanding that the best word is not always the most impressive but the most exact. | Being able to choose precise vocabulary but not articulate why specific choices matter; Choosing impressive vocabulary when simplicity would be more powerful |

### Secondary concept: Grammatical variety in writing (EN-KS3-C041)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Using diverse grammatical structures purposefully to create effect

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Writes in repetitive sentence patterns, typically using simple or compound sentences, without varying structure for effect. | Joining sentences with 'and' repeatedly rather than using subordination; Not recognising the difference between compound and complex sentences |
| **Developing** | Uses some variety in sentence structure, including complex sentences with subordinate clauses, though may not vary structure purposefully for effect. | Varying sentence structure for its own sake rather than for a specific effect; Using complex sentences that obscure meaning rather than enhancing it |
| **Secure** | Varies sentence structure deliberately and purposefully, using different constructions to control pace, emphasis, rhythm and reader engagement. | Varying structure but not connecting the variation to a specific purpose; Using fragments or short sentences as a default 'tension' technique without considering alternatives |
| **Mastery** | Controls sentence structure with the fluency of an experienced writer, using syntax as a tool for meaning-making that operates alongside vocabulary, imagery and structure. | Creating an effect that the reader can only appreciate if told to look for it; Forcing syntax to mirror content in every sentence, which becomes exhausting rather than effective |

### Secondary concept: Literary devices in writing (EN-KS3-C043)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Applying literary techniques (imagery, symbolism, alliteration) learned from reading

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Uses basic descriptive language in writing but does not consciously apply literary devices learned from reading. | Using cliched comparisons ('rain like bullets', 'dark as night'); Including only one device as a token effort rather than integrating techniques throughout |
| **Developing** | Applies literary devices from reading to own writing with growing confidence, using imagery, symbolism and figurative language to create effects. | Using literary devices that clash with each other or with the mood of the piece; Overloading description with so many devices that it becomes overwrought |
| **Secure** | Transfers literary techniques from reading into own writing with control and purpose, understanding that literary devices should serve meaning rather than decorate it. | Establishing the metaphor but not developing it across the paragraph; Using literary devices in isolation rather than allowing them to work together |
| **Mastery** | Uses literary devices with originality and restraint, creating writing where technique serves vision, and demonstrates a personal writing style developed through wide reading. | Imitating a specific author's style rather than developing their own; Using technique to impressive effect but without emotional truth |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Structuring extended writing for formal purposes requires understanding how different essay architectures (chronological, analytical, comparative) serve different purposes — structure is always in service of communicative function.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- How does the structure at this scale enable the function we observe?
- What trade-offs were involved in this structural design?
- How is this structure adapted to solve a specific problem?
- What would you predict about an organism's function from its structure alone?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Formal expository and narrative essays require pupils to plan how evidence and argument will be sequenced — the essay form is the written argument structure, and planning is the process of organising claims and support before drafting.

## Session structure: Creative Response + Writer's Workshop

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Creative Response (main structure)
A creative arts or writing sequence that develops technique through exposure to exemplary work, guided exploration of techniques, structured planning, independent creation, and peer critique. Balances creative freedom with technical skill development.

`exemplar_exposure` → `technique_exploration` → `planning` → `creating` → `critique`

**Assessment:** Final creative outcome (artwork, design, written piece) accompanied by a reflective evaluation discussing techniques used, influences, and areas for development.

**Teacher note:** Use the CREATIVE RESPONSE template: present exemplars from diverse traditions and guide critical analysis of technique, context, and meaning. Expect pupils to experiment with techniques, document their creative process, and produce work that demonstrates informed artistic or literary choices. Facilitate structured critique using subject-specific terminology and assessment criteria.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How does the context of this work influence its meaning?
- What techniques will you experiment with, and how do they serve your intention?
- How does your creative process connect to the exemplars you studied?
- What specific aspects of your work would you refine, and why?

### Writer's Workshop
A process-writing sequence that develops pupils as independent writers. Studies a mentor text to identify craft techniques, practises those techniques in isolation, plans an original piece, drafts with attention to audience and purpose, engages in peer review for feedback, revises and edits, and publishes the final piece.

`mentor_text` → `technique_identification` → `planning` → `drafting` → `peer_review` → `editing` → `publication`

**Assessment:** Final published piece demonstrating identified craft techniques, with writing portfolio showing development through the drafting and revision process.

**Teacher note:** Use the WRITER'S WORKSHOP template: present a mentor text for analysis of craft choices, examining how the writer achieves specific effects on the reader. Guide deliberate practice of identified techniques through planning and drafting. Facilitate structured peer review using clear criteria. Expect pupils to edit with precision, refining sentence structure, vocabulary, and overall cohesion, and to reflect on their development as a writer.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How does the mentor text achieve this effect, and what can you learn from it?
- What deliberate craft choices have you made in your draft, and why?
- What specific improvements did peer review identify, and how will you address them?
- How has your writing developed through this process?

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Fiction
**Features to teach:** sensory detail and controlled imagery (showing not telling), varied sentence structures for effect (short for tension, complex for description, minor for impact), structural control (opening hook, shift in pace or perspective, satisfying ending), conscious vocabulary choice — ambitious but precise, avoiding purple prose

**Writing outcome:** Write a narrative or descriptive piece (450-600 words) in response to a visual or textual prompt, demonstrating controlled voice, varied sentence structures, and effective structural choices

**Literary terms:** imagery, sensory detail, pathetic fallacy, symbolism, narrative voice, cyclical structure, foreshadowing

---

## Suggested texts

- **The Woman in Black (opening chapter)** by Susan Hill — Master class in atmospheric descriptive writing and building tension
- **Stone Cold (opening)** by Robert Swindells — Dual narrative voice; immediate engagement through character voice

---

## Genre

- **Narrative:** Extended prose fiction with characters, setting, and a plot driven by conflict and resolution. The dominant literary form across all key stages, progressing from simple retelling (KS1) through structured narrative (KS2) to literary fiction with controlled voice and style (KS3-KS4).
- **Creative Writing:** Creative composition assessed as a GCSE exam component, encompassing narrative and descriptive writing. Distinct from KS2 narrative because creative writing at KS4 is a timed exam skill requiring conscious technical control under pressure. Students must demonstrate a range of vocabulary, sentence structures, and structural techniques within a single piece.

---

## Why this study matters

Creative writing at GCSE (Language Paper 1 Section B) carries 40 marks and is where many students earn or lose their target grade. KS3 is the time to develop the craft habits that distinguish high-quality creative writing: showing not telling, varying sentence structures for deliberate effect, and making conscious structural choices. Regular practice across all three years builds the writing stamina and technical range that timed exam conditions demand.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Writing too much — 800 uncontrolled words rather than 500 precise ones with clear structural shape
2. Figurative language piled on without consideration of overall effect (mixed metaphors, cliched similes)
3. Opening with weather or waking up rather than an engaging hook
4. No structural planning, leading to narratives that trail off without a satisfying conclusion

---

## Reading and writing skills (KS3)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Word meaning from context** — Understand the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in simple texts by using the surrounding context, including pictures and sentence sense, to make a reasonable guess at what the word means.
- **Information retrieval from simple texts** — Find and report specific information or key facts from a short piece of fiction or non-fiction, identifying the part of the text where the answer is located.
- **Retelling and sequencing** — Retell the main events of a story or the key steps in a non-fiction text, placing them in the correct order and identifying the most important ideas.
- **Simple inference from text** — Use clues in the text — characters' words, actions and feelings — to work out something the author has not stated directly, and begin to explain the reasoning behind that interpretation.
- **Prediction from text clues** — Predict what is likely to happen next in a story or sequence of events, drawing on what has already been read and on prior knowledge of similar texts and situations.
- **Noticing interesting words and phrases** — Identify and discuss words and phrases that capture attention or create an effect, beginning to explain what makes them interesting, surprising or effective in the context of the text.
