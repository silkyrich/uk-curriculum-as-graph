## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Pre-1914 literature (EN-KS3-C002)

**Type:** Content | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Engaging with literary texts written before 1914 to understand historical literary traditions

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce pre-1914 texts with accessible entry points: read aloud together, provide glossaries for archaic vocabulary, and contextualise the historical period briefly before reading. Use paired extracts — a pre-1914 passage alongside a modern text on a similar theme — to build comparison skills. Encourage students to notice how language has changed while recognising that themes (love, ambition, injustice) remain constant.

**Key vocabulary:** pre-1914, archaic, Victorian, Romantic, Gothic, Shakespearean, literary heritage, canon, antiquated, prose style, formal register, narrative convention, social context

**Common misconceptions:** Students frequently assume pre-1914 texts are 'too hard' or irrelevant, often abandoning close reading at the first unfamiliar word. Some students treat all pre-1914 writing as a single homogeneous style, not recognising differences between, say, Romantic poetry and Victorian prose.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Finds pre-1914 texts difficult to access and tends to disengage when encountering unfamiliar vocabulary or sentence structures. | Read this short extract from 'Oliver Twist' by Dickens. What is happening in the scene? | Giving up when encountering unfamiliar vocabulary instead of using context clues; Treating all pre-1914 writing as equally old and difficult |
| **Developing** | Can follow the plot and meaning of pre-1914 texts with some teacher support, and begins to notice how older language differs from modern English. | Read this extract from 'Jane Eyre'. Identify two words or phrases that a modern writer probably would not use and explain what they mean. | Assuming every unfamiliar word is archaic when some are simply advanced vocabulary still in use; Identifying differences in language without commenting on their effect |
| **Secure** | Reads pre-1914 literature with confidence, understanding the relationship between the text and its historical period, and comparing older and modern literary conventions. | Compare the opening of a Dickens novel with the opening of a contemporary novel. How do the writers' techniques reflect their different historical contexts? | Describing differences in language without connecting them to historical context; Assuming pre-1914 writing is automatically inferior to modern writing or vice versa |
| **Mastery** | Engages independently with a range of pre-1914 texts from different periods and genres, evaluating how literary movements and historical conditions shaped writers' choices. | Explain how the Gothic tradition in 19th-century literature reflects the anxieties of the Victorian period, using examples from at least two texts. | Treating Gothic conventions as simply 'scary' rather than analysing their ideological function; Conflating the early Gothic (Shelley, 1818) with the late-Victorian Gothic (Stevenson, 1886) without noting differences |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Oliver is asking for more food. The people in charge are shocked and angry because he is not supposed to ask for more.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Bronte writes 'I was glad of it' where we would say 'I was happy about it'. She also writes 'ere long' which means 'before long' or 'soon'. The language is more formal and the sentences are longer than modern writing, which makes it feel more distant and serious.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Dickens opens 'Great Expectations' with a long, retrospective first-person narration where the adult Pip explains his childhood name and family circumstances. The sentences are complex and formal, reflecting the Victorian convention of detailed, authorial scene-setting. A contemporary novel like 'The Hate U Give' by Angie Thomas opens with immediate dialogue and colloquial first-person voice, reflecting modern expectations of pace and authentic voice. Dickens assumes a patient reader; Thomas assumes a reader who needs to be hooked instantly. Both use first person to build sympathy, but the Victorian version establishes social context first while the modern version establishes character and voice first.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Gothic literature uses the supernatural and the uncanny to externalise anxieties that Victorian society could not openly discuss. Stevenson's 'Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde' (1886) reflects fears about the duality of respectable Victorian masculinity -- the idea that behind the civilised gentleman lurks a primitive, violent self. This connects to Darwinian anxieties about evolution and the fear that humanity might not be as far from animals as the Victorians wished. Shelley's 'Frankenstein' (1818), written earlier but foundational to the Gothic tradition, reflects Romantic-era fears about the unchecked power of science and the danger of humans playing God. Both texts use isolation, darkness, and physical monstrosity as metaphors for social transgression. The Gothic tradition survives because its core technique -- using the horrifying to explore the unspeakable -- remains relevant, but the specific anxieties it addresses are deeply rooted in the concerns of their own period.*

### Secondary concept: Figurative language analysis (EN-KS3-C015)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Identifying and analyzing metaphors, similes, personification, and other figurative devices

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify simple figurative devices (simile, metaphor) when prompted but struggles to explain their effect beyond naming them. | Naming the device without explaining its effect ('the writer uses a simile'); Confusing simile and metaphor |
| **Developing** | Identifies figurative language and explains its effect with some detail, beginning to consider why the writer chose a particular image. | Explaining only one layer of meaning when the image supports multiple readings; Identifying effect in general terms ('it makes the reader feel sad') without precision |
| **Secure** | Analyses figurative language with precision, exploring connotation, semantic fields and the interaction between images, and explaining how figurative devices contribute to the text's overall meaning. | Analysing each image separately without exploring how they interact within the line; Missing the biblical allusion and its implications for characterisation |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates how figurative language operates across a whole text, tracking image patterns, analysing how they develop and change, and assessing their contribution to the text's thematic argument. | Listing examples of blood imagery without tracing its development; Not connecting the image pattern to the play's thematic argument |

### Secondary concept: Poetic conventions recognition (EN-KS3-C019)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Identifying poetic forms (sonnet, ballad, free verse), meter, rhyme schemes, and structural patterns

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Recognises that poetry looks different from prose on the page but cannot name or describe specific poetic conventions. | Defining poetry only by rhyme, missing free verse and other forms; Not recognising stanza breaks as meaningful structural choices |
| **Developing** | Identifies common poetic forms and features including rhyme scheme, stanza form and basic metre, and recognises that these are deliberate choices. | Identifying the rhyme scheme without commenting on its effect; Describing stanza form without considering why the poet chose it |
| **Secure** | Analyses how poetic conventions including form, metre, rhyme, enjambment, caesura and stanza structure work together to create meaning and effect. | Identifying the sonnet form without explaining why Owen chose it; Describing the octave/sestet structure without analysing the effect of the volta |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates how poets use, adapt and subvert poetic conventions to create complex meaning, understanding the relationship between form and content as itself an argument. | Comparing the poems' content without analysing how form itself carries meaning; Describing both poets' use of form without reaching a comparative conclusion |

### Secondary concept: Poetic device analysis (EN-KS3-C020)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Analyzing how poetic devices (imagery, sound patterns, enjambment) create meaning and effect

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Identifies obvious poetic devices (rhyme, alliteration) but cannot explain their effect beyond saying the poem 'sounds nice'. | Identifying a device without explaining its specific effect in context; Using vague evaluative language ('sounds nice', 'flows well') instead of precise analysis |
| **Developing** | Analyses the effect of poetic devices with some detail, beginning to connect sound, imagery and structure to meaning. | Describing enjambment as simply 'the sentence continues onto the next line' without explaining the effect of the specific break point; Not considering how enjambment interacts with other devices in the poem |
| **Secure** | Analyses how multiple poetic devices interact to create layered effects, connecting sound, imagery, structure and meaning with precision. | Analysing sound and imagery separately without exploring how they work together; Identifying the atmosphere without explaining precisely how the combination of devices creates it |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates how poetic devices function within the total design of a poem, assessing how technique serves the poet's thematic and emotional argument across the entire work. | Choosing a technique that is incidental rather than central to the poem's meaning; Describing how the technique works without arguing why it is essential to the poem's thematic purpose |

### Secondary concept: Literary heritage appreciation (EN-KS3-C079)

**Type:** Attitude | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Valuing and engaging with the rich tradition of English literature

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Has limited awareness of the English literary heritage and may not understand what 'literary heritage' means. | Knowing only one or two canonical authors; Not understanding why some texts are considered part of a literary heritage |
| **Developing** | Recognises key authors and works from the English literary heritage and understands that certain texts are considered important because of their influence and quality. | Accepting canonical status without critical thought ('they are taught because they are good'); Not considering that literary heritage is constructed and can be questioned |
| **Secure** | Engages critically with the English literary heritage, understanding how canonical texts have shaped the tradition and how the canon itself has been constructed and contested. | Defending or attacking the canon without nuance or evidence; Assuming that 'heritage' means 'old' rather than recognising it as an evolving tradition |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates the literary heritage as both a resource and a cultural construction, understanding how engagement with canonical and non-canonical texts together produces a richer and more critically aware reading practice. | Arguing for one side (canonical or non-canonical) without showing how both together are more valuable; Not grounding the argument in specific textual analysis |

## Thinking lens: Continuity and Change Over Time (primary)

**Key question:** What has stayed the same, what has changed, and what drove that change?

**Why this lens fits:** The historical dimension of literary heritage positions literature as a record of changing perspectives over time — pupils trace how literary conventions, themes and forms evolve across different periods.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- Was this change gradual or sudden, and what determined the pace?
- What factors promoted continuity, and what factors drove change?
- How significant was this change — did it affect everyone, or only some?
- How do different historians interpret this period of change?

**Secondary lens:** Perspective and Interpretation — Reading across pre-1914 literature, contemporary fiction, Shakespeare and world literature requires pupils to recognise that texts are products of specific cultural and historical perspectives — understanding a Victorian novel or a Shakespearean play requires reconstructing the perspective from which it was written.

## Session structure: Text Study + Text Study (Literature)

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Text Study (main structure)
A reading-to-writing cycle for primary and KS3 English. Begins with shared or guided reading of a high-quality text, moves through analysis of language features and authorial choices, builds vocabulary, then scaffolds the writing process from planning through drafting to editing and publication.

`shared_reading` → `analysis` → `vocabulary` → `planning` → `drafting` → `editing`

**Assessment:** Final written outcome in the genre studied, demonstrating understanding of text features, appropriate vocabulary use, and effective application of the writing process.

**Teacher note:** Use the TEXT STUDY template: present a text for close reading, guiding analysis of language, structure, and form in relation to purpose and audience. Expect pupils to use precise literary terminology. Support them in crafting their own writing that consciously deploys techniques studied, with structured peer review and editing focused on the impact of specific choices.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How does the writer use language to achieve a specific effect on the reader?
- What is the relationship between the structure of this text and its meaning?
- How effectively have you deployed the technique in your own writing?
- What revision would most improve the impact of your piece?

### Text Study (Literature)
A KS4 literature study sequence designed for GCSE English Literature preparation. Contextualises the text within its literary and historical period, develops close reading skills, applies literary analysis using subject terminology, supports comparison across texts, and scaffolds essay writing in exam-appropriate formats.

`context_setting` → `close_reading` → `literary_analysis` → `comparison` → `essay_writing`

**Assessment:** Timed essay response in GCSE format demonstrating close textual analysis, use of literary terminology, contextual understanding, and structured argument with embedded quotations.

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Poetry
**Features to teach:** Romantic conventions (nature as sublime, imagination as creative power, the individual versus society), imagery and figurative language in poetry (extended metaphor, personification, synaesthesia), metre and rhythm (iambic pentameter, tetrameter) and their contribution to meaning, relationship between poetic form and content (sonnet, ode, lyric)

**Writing outcome:** Write an analytical comparison (400-500 words) of two Romantic poems exploring how the poets use imagery and form to present ideas about nature or imagination

**Literary terms:** Romanticism, sublime, imagery, extended metaphor, personification, metre, iambic pentameter, ode, sonnet, lyric

---

## Suggested texts

- **I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud** by William Wordsworth — Accessible entry to Romantic poetry; clear imagery and regular metre
- **Tyger Tyger** by William Blake — Powerful imagery with accessible repeated structure
- **To Autumn** by John Keats — Rich sensory imagery; more demanding vocabulary rewards close reading
- **Ozymandias** by Percy Bysshe Shelley — Sonnet form; themes of power and transience connect to GCSE anthology

---

## Genre

- **Poetry:** Literature using rhythm, imagery, and condensed language to convey meaning and emotion. Poetry is continuous across all key stages with no progression break, but expectations increase: from recitation and simple pattern-following (KS1) through multiple forms and figurative language (KS2) to analysis of poetic conventions and unseen poetry comparison (KS4).

---

## Why this study matters

Romantic poetry is a statutory requirement at KS3 and the foundational literary movement for understanding the English poetic tradition. Studying Wordsworth, Blake, Shelley, and Keats introduces students to the analytical vocabulary and close reading skills they will need at GCSE (Ozymandias appears on the AQA Power and Conflict anthology). The Romantic focus on nature, imagination, and individual feeling provides an accessible emotional entry point for teenage readers while demanding sophisticated analysis of form and language.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Treating Romantic poetry as simply 'about nature' without exploring the philosophical ideas about imagination, freedom, and the self
2. Students identify imagery (simile, metaphor) without analysing why the poet chose that particular image and its effect
3. Historical context (Industrial Revolution, French Revolution) presented as background information rather than integrated into analysis of why these poets valued nature and imagination

## Cross-curricular opportunities

| Link | Subject | Connection | Strength |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| Ideas, Power, Industry and Empire 1745-1901 | History | Industrial Revolution, urbanisation, and the Romantic reaction against mechanisation | Strong |

## Reading and writing skills (KS3)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Word meaning from context** — Understand the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in simple texts by using the surrounding context, including pictures and sentence sense, to make a reasonable guess at what the word means.
- **Information retrieval from simple texts** — Find and report specific information or key facts from a short piece of fiction or non-fiction, identifying the part of the text where the answer is located.
- **Retelling and sequencing** — Retell the main events of a story or the key steps in a non-fiction text, placing them in the correct order and identifying the most important ideas.
- **Simple inference from text** — Use clues in the text — characters' words, actions and feelings — to work out something the author has not stated directly, and begin to explain the reasoning behind that interpretation.
- **Prediction from text clues** — Predict what is likely to happen next in a story or sequence of events, drawing on what has already been read and on prior knowledge of similar texts and situations.
- **Noticing interesting words and phrases** — Identify and discuss words and phrases that capture attention or create an effect, beginning to explain what makes them interesting, surprising or effective in the context of the text.
