## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Pre-1914 literature (EN-KS3-C002)

**Type:** Content | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Engaging with literary texts written before 1914 to understand historical literary traditions

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce pre-1914 texts with accessible entry points: read aloud together, provide glossaries for archaic vocabulary, and contextualise the historical period briefly before reading. Use paired extracts — a pre-1914 passage alongside a modern text on a similar theme — to build comparison skills. Encourage students to notice how language has changed while recognising that themes (love, ambition, injustice) remain constant.

**Key vocabulary:** pre-1914, archaic, Victorian, Romantic, Gothic, Shakespearean, literary heritage, canon, antiquated, prose style, formal register, narrative convention, social context

**Common misconceptions:** Students frequently assume pre-1914 texts are 'too hard' or irrelevant, often abandoning close reading at the first unfamiliar word. Some students treat all pre-1914 writing as a single homogeneous style, not recognising differences between, say, Romantic poetry and Victorian prose.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Finds pre-1914 texts difficult to access and tends to disengage when encountering unfamiliar vocabulary or sentence structures. | Read this short extract from 'Oliver Twist' by Dickens. What is happening in the scene? | Giving up when encountering unfamiliar vocabulary instead of using context clues; Treating all pre-1914 writing as equally old and difficult |
| **Developing** | Can follow the plot and meaning of pre-1914 texts with some teacher support, and begins to notice how older language differs from modern English. | Read this extract from 'Jane Eyre'. Identify two words or phrases that a modern writer probably would not use and explain what they mean. | Assuming every unfamiliar word is archaic when some are simply advanced vocabulary still in use; Identifying differences in language without commenting on their effect |
| **Secure** | Reads pre-1914 literature with confidence, understanding the relationship between the text and its historical period, and comparing older and modern literary conventions. | Compare the opening of a Dickens novel with the opening of a contemporary novel. How do the writers' techniques reflect their different historical contexts? | Describing differences in language without connecting them to historical context; Assuming pre-1914 writing is automatically inferior to modern writing or vice versa |
| **Mastery** | Engages independently with a range of pre-1914 texts from different periods and genres, evaluating how literary movements and historical conditions shaped writers' choices. | Explain how the Gothic tradition in 19th-century literature reflects the anxieties of the Victorian period, using examples from at least two texts. | Treating Gothic conventions as simply 'scary' rather than analysing their ideological function; Conflating the early Gothic (Shelley, 1818) with the late-Victorian Gothic (Stevenson, 1886) without noting differences |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Oliver is asking for more food. The people in charge are shocked and angry because he is not supposed to ask for more.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Bronte writes 'I was glad of it' where we would say 'I was happy about it'. She also writes 'ere long' which means 'before long' or 'soon'. The language is more formal and the sentences are longer than modern writing, which makes it feel more distant and serious.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Dickens opens 'Great Expectations' with a long, retrospective first-person narration where the adult Pip explains his childhood name and family circumstances. The sentences are complex and formal, reflecting the Victorian convention of detailed, authorial scene-setting. A contemporary novel like 'The Hate U Give' by Angie Thomas opens with immediate dialogue and colloquial first-person voice, reflecting modern expectations of pace and authentic voice. Dickens assumes a patient reader; Thomas assumes a reader who needs to be hooked instantly. Both use first person to build sympathy, but the Victorian version establishes social context first while the modern version establishes character and voice first.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Gothic literature uses the supernatural and the uncanny to externalise anxieties that Victorian society could not openly discuss. Stevenson's 'Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde' (1886) reflects fears about the duality of respectable Victorian masculinity -- the idea that behind the civilised gentleman lurks a primitive, violent self. This connects to Darwinian anxieties about evolution and the fear that humanity might not be as far from animals as the Victorians wished. Shelley's 'Frankenstein' (1818), written earlier but foundational to the Gothic tradition, reflects Romantic-era fears about the unchecked power of science and the danger of humans playing God. Both texts use isolation, darkness, and physical monstrosity as metaphors for social transgression. The Gothic tradition survives because its core technique -- using the horrifying to explore the unspeakable -- remains relevant, but the specific anxieties it addresses are deeply rooted in the concerns of their own period.*

### Secondary concept: Historical and cultural context (EN-KS3-C013)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Understanding texts within their historical, social, and cultural contexts

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Reads texts without considering the historical or cultural conditions in which they were written, treating all texts as if they were written today. | Assuming that historical context is irrelevant to understanding a text; Judging characters' behaviour by modern standards without historical awareness |
| **Developing** | Recognises that historical and cultural context affects a text's meaning and can identify basic contextual information when prompted. | Mentioning context in general terms without connecting it to specific textual details; Treating context as background information rather than as something that shapes meaning |
| **Secure** | Integrates contextual knowledge into textual analysis, explaining how historical, social and cultural conditions shape a writer's choices and a reader's interpretation. | Adding context as a separate paragraph rather than weaving it into textual analysis; Applying only one contextual lens when multiple contexts are relevant |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates how multiple contexts (historical, cultural, biographical, literary) interact to create meaning, and understands that context is itself an interpretive choice -- different contexts produce different readings. | Presenting one contextual reading as the definitive interpretation; Listing contexts without showing how each produces a distinct reading of specific textual details |

### Secondary concept: Setting analysis (EN-KS3-C021)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Analyzing how settings establish mood, symbolize themes, and influence character and plot

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Notices where a story takes place but does not consider how setting contributes to mood, theme or character. | Describing setting as background information rather than as a meaningful literary choice; Not connecting setting to mood or atmosphere |
| **Developing** | Explains how setting creates mood and atmosphere, identifying how specific details of place, weather and time contribute to the reader's experience. | Listing setting details without explaining what atmosphere they create; Describing the atmosphere in one word ('scary', 'sad') without analysing how it is built |
| **Secure** | Analyses how writers use setting symbolically and structurally, understanding how place reflects character, reinforces theme and shapes narrative development. | Analysing the symbolic meaning without also considering the literal and emotional effects; Not connecting the setting analysis to the wider themes of the novel |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates how settings function as dynamic elements within a text, changing in significance as the narrative develops, and contributing to the text's structural and thematic architecture. | Comparing settings at a descriptive level without connecting the contrast to thematic argument; Not showing how the relationship between settings changes across the novel |

### Secondary concept: Plot structure analysis (EN-KS3-C022)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Understanding narrative structure (exposition, rising action, climax, resolution) and its effects

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can retell the events of a story in order but does not consider why the writer structured the narrative in a particular way. | Treating plot as a simple sequence of events rather than a deliberate construction; Not recognising that the order of events is a choice the writer makes |
| **Developing** | Identifies key plot elements (exposition, rising action, climax, resolution) and begins to explain how the writer builds tension and interest. | Identifying the most dramatic moment rather than the structural turning point; Not explaining how earlier narrative choices prepare for the climax |
| **Secure** | Analyses how plot structure creates suspense, meaning and emotional impact, understanding how writers manipulate narrative order, pacing and revelation. | Describing what happens in each timeline without analysing the effect of their juxtaposition; Not connecting the structural choice to the novel's thematic concerns |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates how plot structure functions as a form of argument, understanding how narrative architecture shapes the reader's moral and intellectual response across the whole text. | Arguing that the structure creates tension without showing how it makes an argument; Not demonstrating convincingly that a different order would change the meaning |

### Secondary concept: Characterisation analysis (EN-KS3-C023)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Analyzing how characters are developed through description, dialogue, actions, and relationships

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Describes characters by their physical appearance or basic personality traits but does not analyse how the writer constructs them. | Treating characters as real people rather than as constructions by the writer; Describing personality without using evidence from the text |
| **Developing** | Explains how a character is presented through specific textual details, including what they say, do and how others respond to them. | Relying only on what the writer explicitly tells us rather than analysing indirect characterisation; Not considering how different techniques (dialogue, action, others' reactions) work together |
| **Secure** | Analyses how characters are constructed through multiple techniques, understanding how characterisation develops across a text and how characters serve thematic purposes. | Tracing the character arc without analysing the specific techniques Shakespeare uses; Discussing Lady Macbeth as if she were a real person rather than a dramatic construction |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates how characterisation functions within the text's larger thematic and structural design, analysing how characters relate to each other, to genre conventions and to the writer's moral or political argument. | Arguing that the character is a device without showing how this serves the text's purpose; Not considering whether the character also has elements of psychological realism alongside their structural function |

## Thinking lens: Continuity and Change Over Time (primary)

**Key question:** What has stayed the same, what has changed, and what drove that change?

**Why this lens fits:** The historical dimension of literary heritage positions literature as a record of changing perspectives over time — pupils trace how literary conventions, themes and forms evolve across different periods.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- Was this change gradual or sudden, and what determined the pace?
- What factors promoted continuity, and what factors drove change?
- How significant was this change — did it affect everyone, or only some?
- How do different historians interpret this period of change?

**Secondary lens:** Perspective and Interpretation — Reading across pre-1914 literature, contemporary fiction, Shakespeare and world literature requires pupils to recognise that texts are products of specific cultural and historical perspectives — understanding a Victorian novel or a Shakespearean play requires reconstructing the perspective from which it was written.

## Session structure: Text Study + Text Study (Literature)

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Text Study (main structure)
A reading-to-writing cycle for primary and KS3 English. Begins with shared or guided reading of a high-quality text, moves through analysis of language features and authorial choices, builds vocabulary, then scaffolds the writing process from planning through drafting to editing and publication.

`shared_reading` → `analysis` → `vocabulary` → `planning` → `drafting` → `editing`

**Assessment:** Final written outcome in the genre studied, demonstrating understanding of text features, appropriate vocabulary use, and effective application of the writing process.

**Teacher note:** Use the TEXT STUDY template: present a text for close reading, guiding analysis of language, structure, and form in relation to purpose and audience. Expect pupils to use precise literary terminology. Support them in crafting their own writing that consciously deploys techniques studied, with structured peer review and editing focused on the impact of specific choices.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How does the writer use language to achieve a specific effect on the reader?
- What is the relationship between the structure of this text and its meaning?
- How effectively have you deployed the technique in your own writing?
- What revision would most improve the impact of your piece?

### Text Study (Literature)
A KS4 literature study sequence designed for GCSE English Literature preparation. Contextualises the text within its literary and historical period, develops close reading skills, applies literary analysis using subject terminology, supports comparison across texts, and scaffolds essay writing in exam-appropriate formats.

`context_setting` → `close_reading` → `literary_analysis` → `comparison` → `essay_writing`

**Assessment:** Timed essay response in GCSE format demonstrating close textual analysis, use of literary terminology, contextual understanding, and structured argument with embedded quotations.

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Fiction
**Features to teach:** Victorian narrative voice (omniscient narrator, authorial commentary, direct reader address), characterisation through physical description, speech, and social context, social commentary embedded in fiction (Dickens' critique of poverty and institutions), genre conventions of detective fiction (mystery, deduction, red herring, resolution)

**Writing outcome:** Write a comparative analytical essay (400-500 words) comparing how Dickens and Conan Doyle use narrative voice and characterisation to create different effects for the reader

**Literary terms:** omniscient narrator, social commentary, characterisation, motif, gothic, detective fiction, red herring, deduction

---

## Suggested texts

- **Oliver Twist (selected chapters)** by Charles Dickens — Vivid social commentary; accessible through selected chapters focusing on key scenes
- **A Christmas Carol** by Charles Dickens — Short enough for whole-text study; excellent GCSE preparation (AQA 19th-century novel)
- **The Speckled Band** by Arthur Conan Doyle — Classic detective story; Watson as narrator provides accessible entry to narrative perspective

---

## Genre

- **Literary Fiction:** Prose fiction studied analytically for its literary qualities rather than simply read for plot. The progression from KS2 narrative: at KS3-KS4, fiction becomes an object of critical study where students analyse how authors construct meaning through language, structure, and form. Includes both reading (textual analysis) and writing (creative composition).

---

## Why this study matters

Victorian fiction is the dominant prose tradition at GCSE (A Christmas Carol, Jekyll and Hyde, Frankenstein) and KS3 is the time to build familiarity with 19th-century language and conventions. Pairing Dickens with Conan Doyle enables comparative analysis of two very different Victorian voices — Dickens' moral earnestness versus Conan Doyle's analytical precision — and introduces students to the concept that genre shapes how stories are told. The extract-based approach keeps the reading load manageable while building confidence with pre-1914 prose.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Victorian language treated as a barrier rather than an opportunity to develop reading resilience and vocabulary inference skills
2. Dickens reduced to 'he wrote about poverty' without analysing his specific narrative techniques
3. Comparative work is sequential (all about Dickens, then all about Conan Doyle) rather than integrated around shared analytical questions

| Link | Subject | Connection | Strength |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| Ideas, Power, Industry and Empire 1745-1901 | History | Victorian Britain — poverty, workhouses, social reform, industrialisation, and the growth of Empire | Strong |

## Reading and writing skills (KS3)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Word meaning from context** — Understand the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in simple texts by using the surrounding context, including pictures and sentence sense, to make a reasonable guess at what the word means.
- **Information retrieval from simple texts** — Find and report specific information or key facts from a short piece of fiction or non-fiction, identifying the part of the text where the answer is located.
- **Retelling and sequencing** — Retell the main events of a story or the key steps in a non-fiction text, placing them in the correct order and identifying the most important ideas.
- **Simple inference from text** — Use clues in the text — characters' words, actions and feelings — to work out something the author has not stated directly, and begin to explain the reasoning behind that interpretation.
- **Prediction from text clues** — Predict what is likely to happen next in a story or sequence of events, drawing on what has already been read and on prior knowledge of similar texts and situations.
- **Noticing interesting words and phrases** — Identify and discuss words and phrases that capture attention or create an effect, beginning to explain what makes them interesting, surprising or effective in the context of the text.
