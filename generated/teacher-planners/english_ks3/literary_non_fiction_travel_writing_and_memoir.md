## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Purpose and audience analysis (EN-KS3-C012)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Understanding how the intended purpose and audience shape a text's meaning and form

**Teaching guidance:** Teach students to ask three questions of any text: Who is it for? What is it trying to do? How does this shape the choices the writer makes? Use comparative activities where the same topic is treated differently for different audiences (e.g., a news report vs. a diary entry about the same event). Analyse real-world texts such as adverts, speeches, and articles to make purpose and audience tangible. Link purpose and audience analysis to students' own writing choices.

**Key vocabulary:** purpose, audience, form, inform, persuade, entertain, argue, advise, target audience, register, tone, convention, adapt, tailor, viewpoint, bias

**Common misconceptions:** Students often identify purpose and audience in simple terms ('to inform adults') without exploring how these shape specific language and structural choices. Some students assume a text has only one purpose, missing how writers often combine purposes (e.g., persuading while appearing to inform). Others confuse the topic of a text with its purpose.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Reads texts without considering who they were written for or why, treating all texts as straightforward communication. | Who is this newspaper article written for? What is it trying to do? | Identifying audience in vague terms ('everyone', 'newspaper readers') without specificity; Not distinguishing between informing, persuading, entertaining and arguing |
| **Developing** | Identifies the likely audience and purpose of texts with some accuracy and begins to notice how these shape the writer's choices. | This charity advert uses a photograph of a child and the phrase 'Just 2 pounds a month'. Who is the target audience and what is the purpose? How do you know? | Identifying audience and purpose correctly but not explaining how specific features serve them; Assuming that all persuasive texts work in the same way |
| **Secure** | Analyses how audience and purpose shape every aspect of a text's language, structure and presentation, and explains the relationship between these elements with precision. | Compare how a tabloid and a broadsheet newspaper report the same event. How do their different audiences affect their language choices? | Describing differences without explaining how audience drives them; Treating one approach as objectively better rather than suited to different purposes |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates how texts construct and manipulate their implied audience, recognising that audience and purpose are not fixed but are created by the text itself, and critiques the assumptions texts make about their readers. | How does a political speech construct its audience? Analyse how the speaker creates a sense of shared identity and purpose. | Analysing the speech's content without examining how its rhetoric constructs an audience; Treating the audience as a pre-existing group rather than one created by the text |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *It is written for people who read newspapers. It is telling them about something that happened.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *The audience is adults who have some money to spare, probably parents because the photo of a child appeals to parental instinct. The purpose is to persuade people to donate. The phrase 'Just 2 pounds' makes it sound affordable and easy. The photograph creates an emotional response.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *The tabloid uses short sentences, colloquial vocabulary ('slammed', 'fury'), a dramatic headline, and emotive language that positions the reader to share the writer's outrage. Its audience expects entertainment alongside information, so the report reads like a story with a clear villain. The broadsheet uses longer, more complex sentences, formal vocabulary ('criticism', 'controversy'), qualifying language ('some analysts suggest'), and a more balanced presentation of multiple viewpoints. Its audience expects nuanced analysis, so the writer maintains a more measured tone. Both report the same facts but the tabloid's purpose is to provoke an emotional reaction while the broadsheet's is to inform and enable the reader's own judgement. The tabloid assumes a reader with strong existing opinions; the broadsheet assumes a reader who wants evidence before forming one.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Political speeches do not merely address an existing audience -- they construct one. Martin Luther King's 'I Have a Dream' speech uses the first-person plural ('we') to create a unified collective from a diverse crowd: 'We cannot walk alone.' This pronominal choice transforms individuals into a movement. The repeated refrain 'I have a dream' shifts from collective present ('we') to individual future vision ('I'), positioning King as the voice of the community's aspirations. The speech also constructs its audience through exclusion: the 'we' implicitly defines a 'they' (those who oppose civil rights), which gives the audience a shared adversary and therefore a shared identity. The biblical register ('Let freedom ring') constructs an audience that recognises scriptural allusion, connecting the civil rights movement to a moral tradition. The speech's audience is not just the 250,000 people on the Mall; through its rhetoric, it constructs an imagined community of all who share these values. This is what the best persuasive writing does: it does not find its audience but creates it.*

### Secondary concept: Wide reading breadth (EN-KS3-C001)

**Type:** Content | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Reading across diverse genres, historical periods, forms, and authors including fiction, non-fiction, poetry, and drama

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Reads mostly within a single genre or form (e.g. only fantasy novels) and rarely ventures beyond familiar authors or types of text. | Believing wide reading means reading lots of books, regardless of variety; Not recognising poetry, drama or non-fiction as valid reading choices |
| **Developing** | Reads across two or three genres or forms with some awareness that breadth matters, but needs prompting to try unfamiliar types of text. | Choosing a text from a superficially different genre that is actually very similar (e.g. switching from fantasy to sci-fi); Struggling to articulate what makes one form different from another |
| **Secure** | Reads confidently across fiction, non-fiction, poetry and drama from different periods and traditions, and can explain how different forms offer different reading experiences. | Listing texts from only one period or tradition; Omitting poetry or drama in favour of prose fiction |
| **Mastery** | Independently seeks out challenging and unfamiliar texts across genres, periods and cultures, and reflects critically on how reading breadth shapes their understanding of literature and the world. | Making superficial connections between texts without explaining how the different forms shape understanding; Reflecting only on personal enjoyment rather than on how breadth develops critical insight |

### Secondary concept: Vocabulary choice analysis (EN-KS3-C016)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Examining how specific word choices create meaning, tone, and effect

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Notices that writers choose particular words but cannot explain why one word was chosen over another. | Saying a word is 'effective' or 'good' without explaining why; Not considering what the word connotes beyond its literal meaning |
| **Developing** | Explains how specific word choices create particular impressions, beginning to consider connotation and tone. | Explaining effect in only one dimension when the word has multiple connotations; Not connecting the word choice to the wider tone of the passage |
| **Secure** | Analyses vocabulary choices with precision, exploring denotation, connotation, semantic fields and the effect of individual words on tone, mood and characterisation. | Comparing the words without explaining what the difference reveals about characterisation or theme; Analysing the word in isolation rather than considering its effect within the whole sentence |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates how vocabulary choices operate as part of a writer's larger strategy, analysing patterns of diction across a text and assessing how word-level choices serve thematic and structural purposes. | Analysing individual words without connecting them to a pattern or strategy; Not showing how opening vocabulary choices anticipate the novel's themes |

### Secondary concept: Grammatical effect analysis (EN-KS3-C017)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Understanding how grammatical structures (sentence types, tense, voice) create meaning and effect

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Reads sentences without considering how their grammatical construction affects meaning. | Not recognising that different grammatical constructions create different effects; Treating grammar as rules for correctness rather than tools for meaning |
| **Developing** | Recognises that grammatical choices affect meaning and can identify basic effects such as the difference between active and passive voice or short and long sentences. | Saying short sentences 'create tension' as a default explanation without considering the specific context; Not explaining how the grammatical choice works in relation to surrounding sentences |
| **Secure** | Analyses how grammatical features such as sentence structure, tense, voice, clause arrangement and punctuation create specific effects on meaning, tone and pace. | Noting sentence length variation without analysing what each sentence type does in its specific context; Not using grammatical terminology accurately (e.g. confusing clause types) |
| **Mastery** | Evaluates how grammatical choices function as part of a writer's overall craft, connecting syntactic analysis to characterisation, theme and narrative strategy across extended texts. | Describing the syntax without connecting it to character psychology or theme; Treating all long sentences as having the same function |

### Secondary concept: Register awareness (EN-KS3-C055)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

Understanding formal and informal registers and when to use each appropriately

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Uses the same register regardless of context, typically informal, without recognising that different situations require different levels of formality. | Equating register with politeness rather than with language choice; Not recognising that vocabulary, sentence structure and tone all change with register |
| **Developing** | Recognises the difference between formal and informal registers and can adjust vocabulary and tone when the context is clear, though adjustment may be inconsistent. | Adjusting vocabulary but not sentence structure or tone; Mixing registers within a single piece of writing |
| **Secure** | Controls register confidently across a range of contexts, adjusting vocabulary, sentence structure, tone and rhetorical strategy to match the formality requirements of the situation. | Achieving appropriate register but at the cost of voice or engagement; Treating formal register as simply 'longer words and longer sentences' |
| **Mastery** | Manipulates register with sophistication, understanding that register is not just formality but a complex set of linguistic choices shaped by audience, purpose, context and power, and can shift register strategically within a single text. | Shifting register accidentally rather than deliberately; Not being able to explain the rhetorical function of a register shift |

## Thinking lens: Continuity and Change Over Time (primary)

**Key question:** What has stayed the same, what has changed, and what drove that change?

**Why this lens fits:** The historical dimension of literary heritage positions literature as a record of changing perspectives over time — pupils trace how literary conventions, themes and forms evolve across different periods.

**Question stems for KS3:**
- Was this change gradual or sudden, and what determined the pace?
- What factors promoted continuity, and what factors drove change?
- How significant was this change — did it affect everyone, or only some?
- How do different historians interpret this period of change?

**Secondary lens:** Perspective and Interpretation — Reading across pre-1914 literature, contemporary fiction, Shakespeare and world literature requires pupils to recognise that texts are products of specific cultural and historical perspectives — understanding a Victorian novel or a Shakespearean play requires reconstructing the perspective from which it was written.

---

## Session structure: Text Study

### Text Study
A reading-to-writing cycle for primary and KS3 English. Begins with shared or guided reading of a high-quality text, moves through analysis of language features and authorial choices, builds vocabulary, then scaffolds the writing process from planning through drafting to editing and publication.

`shared_reading` → `analysis` → `vocabulary` → `planning` → `drafting` → `editing`

**Assessment:** Final written outcome in the genre studied, demonstrating understanding of text features, appropriate vocabulary use, and effective application of the writing process.

**Teacher note:** Use the TEXT STUDY template: present a text for close reading, guiding analysis of language, structure, and form in relation to purpose and audience. Expect pupils to use precise literary terminology. Support them in crafting their own writing that consciously deploys techniques studied, with structured peer review and editing focused on the impact of specific choices.

**KS3 question stems:**
- How does the writer use language to achieve a specific effect on the reader?
- What is the relationship between the structure of this text and its meaning?
- How effectively have you deployed the technique in your own writing?
- What revision would most improve the impact of your piece?

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Non Fiction
**Features to teach:** personal voice and perspective in non-fiction (how the writer's identity shapes what they see and how they describe it), language analysis in non-fiction texts (rhetorical technique, imagery, structural choices), comparing writers' perspectives on the same subject or experience, how historical period shapes non-fiction writing (19th-century travel writing versus modern memoir)

**Writing outcome:** Write a literary non-fiction piece (400-500 words) — a travel account or memoir extract — using personal voice, descriptive techniques, and conscious structural choices; then write a comparative analysis (300-400 words) of two non-fiction extracts

**Literary terms:** perspective, voice, register, rhetoric, imagery, structural shift, anecdote, tone

---

## Suggested texts

- **Notes from a Small Island (extract)** by Bill Bryson — Humorous, accessible modern travel writing with distinctive personal voice
- **Travels with a Donkey (extract)** by Robert Louis Stevenson — 19th-century travel writing for period comparison; beautiful descriptive prose
- **I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (extract)** by Maya Angelou — Powerful personal voice; memoir conventions with literary quality

---

## Genre

- **Literary Non-Fiction:** Non-fiction texts with literary quality and personal voice, studied for how writers present perspectives and craft meaning. The KS3-KS4 progression from KS2 recount: where KS2 teaches factual recount, KS3-KS4 literary non-fiction examines how real-world writing uses literary techniques for effect. Central to GCSE English Language Paper 2.

---

## Why this study matters

Literary non-fiction is central to GCSE English Language Paper 2, where students must analyse and compare 19th-century and modern non-fiction extracts under timed conditions. KS3 is the time to build familiarity with the genre and the comparative skills it demands. Travel writing and memoir provide accessible, engaging entry points because they combine vivid descriptive writing with personal voice — making it easier for students to see how language choices create effects in non-fiction as well as fiction.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Non-fiction treated as transparent ('it's just facts') rather than analysed for how the writer crafts meaning through language and structure
2. Comparative analysis is superficial ('Both writers describe places') without analysing differences in perspective, purpose, and technique
3. Historical context of 19th-century extracts presented as background rather than integrated into analysis of how period shapes voice and purpose

---

## Cross-curricular opportunities

| Link | Subject | Connection | Strength |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| Ideas, Power, Industry and Empire 1745-1901 | History | 19th-century exploration and Empire — travel writing as a lens on colonial attitudes | Strong |
| Africa: Place Depth Study | Geography | Place writing and geographical perspective — how writers represent African landscapes and peoples | Moderate |

---

## Reading and writing skills (KS3)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Word meaning from context** — Understand the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in simple texts by using the surrounding context, including pictures and sentence sense, to make a reasonable guess at what the word means.
- **Information retrieval from simple texts** — Find and report specific information or key facts from a short piece of fiction or non-fiction, identifying the part of the text where the answer is located.
- **Retelling and sequencing** — Retell the main events of a story or the key steps in a non-fiction text, placing them in the correct order and identifying the most important ideas.
- **Simple inference from text** — Use clues in the text — characters' words, actions and feelings — to work out something the author has not stated directly, and begin to explain the reasoning behind that interpretation.
- **Prediction from text clues** — Predict what is likely to happen next in a story or sequence of events, drawing on what has already been read and on prior knowledge of similar texts and situations.
- **Noticing interesting words and phrases** — Identify and discuss words and phrases that capture attention or create an effect, beginning to explain what makes them interesting, surprising or effective in the context of the text.
