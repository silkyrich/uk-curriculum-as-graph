## Concepts

This study delivers **0 primary concepts** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Secondary concept: Programming: Sequence, Selection and Repetition (CO-KS12-C002)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

All programs are built from three fundamental control structures: sequence (instructions executed in order, one after another), selection (conditional branches where different instructions execute depending on a condition - if/then/else) and repetition (loops where instructions repeat a specified number of times or while a condition holds). These three structures are sufficient to express any computable algorithm, and mastery of them is the core of programming competence. At KS2, pupils learn to use all three structures in their programs, developing increasingly sophisticated and efficient code.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Creating a simple program using sequence — a series of instructions executed in order — using a block-based programming environment. | Putting blocks in the wrong order so the sprite turns before walking; Not connecting blocks together so only the first one runs |
| **Developing** | Using selection (if/then) and repetition (loops) in programs to create more complex behaviour. | Putting the if-statement outside the loop so it only checks once; Creating an infinite loop without any stopping condition |
| **Expected** | Combining sequence, selection and repetition to create programs that solve problems or meet a design brief, using variables to store and change data. | Not initialising the variable at the start (score starts at a random value); Using the wrong comparison operator (= vs >) in the selection |
| **Greater Depth** | Designing modular programs using procedures or functions, explaining how abstraction makes programs easier to understand and maintain. | Creating procedures that are too specific and not genuinely reusable; Not understanding how parameters pass information into procedures |

### Secondary concept: Networks, the Internet and the World Wide Web (CO-KS12-C004)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

A computer network is a collection of computing devices connected together to share data and resources. The internet is the global network of networks, connecting millions of devices worldwide using a common set of protocols. The World Wide Web is a service built on the internet, comprising web pages accessed via browsers. Email, messaging and streaming are other internet services. At KS2, pupils develop conceptual understanding of how networks and the internet work, distinguishing between physical infrastructure and the services that run on top of it.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Understanding that computers can be connected together and that the internet allows people to share information across the world. | Thinking the internet and the World Wide Web are the same thing; Believing websites are 'inside' their own computer |
| **Developing** | Describing how networks work, including the roles of routers, servers and clients, and understanding that the web is a service that runs on the internet. | Using 'internet' and 'web' as if they mean the same thing; Not understanding that the internet existed before the World Wide Web |
| **Expected** | Explaining how data is transmitted across networks using packets and protocols, and understanding how search engines and websites work. | Thinking data travels as one continuous piece rather than in packets; Not understanding that packets can take different routes to the same destination |

## Thinking lens: Systems and System Models (primary)

**Key question:** What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?

**Why this lens fits:** Decomposition requires pupils to model a complex problem as a system of smaller interacting parts — understanding that the whole can be broken into components that each perform a defined function is a systems-thinking act.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- What goes into this system, and what comes out?
- If you changed this one part, what else would be affected?
- Where does this system start and end?
- How could we draw a model to explain how this works?

**Secondary lens:** Cause and Effect — Writing and debugging programs with sequence, selection and repetition demands that pupils predict the effect of each control structure — tracing how changing a condition in a selection statement changes what the program does is a direct cause-and-effect analysis.

## Session structure: Practical Application

### Practical Application
A hands-on sequence where pupils apply knowledge and skills to solve a practical problem or create a functional outcome. Begins with a real-world context, builds skills through rehearsal, guides design or planning, supports making or problem-solving, and concludes with evaluation against success criteria.

`context` → `skill_rehearsal` → `design` → `make_or_solve` → `evaluate`

**Assessment:** Practical outcome (solution, product, program) evaluated against defined success criteria, with written or verbal explanation of the process and decisions made.

**Teacher note:** Use the PRACTICAL APPLICATION template: set a real-world context or problem that requires pupils to apply knowledge and skills. Rehearse the key skills needed through guided practice. Support pupils in designing their approach, carrying out the practical task, and evaluating their outcome. Encourage them to explain what worked well and what they would improve.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What skills will you need to solve this problem?
- What is your plan, and why did you choose this approach?
- How well did your solution work?
- What would you change if you did it again?

## Computing focus

**Programming paradigm:** Markup
**Software/tool:** HTML/CSS
**Computational concepts:** sequence, abstraction
**Abstraction level:** Symbolic
**Themes:** web development, text-based coding, creative computing

---

## Why this study matters

HTML introduces text-based coding in a forgiving context -- mistakes produce visible but non-catastrophic results (a tag in the wrong place makes text look wrong, not crash a program). Creating a web page is inherently meaningful: every website they use is made of HTML. Pupils see the direct relationship between code (text) and output (rendered page). This prepares for text-based programming languages.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Forgetting closing tags -- teach the 'open, content, close' pattern
2. Spelling errors in tags -- HTML tags must be exact; teach careful typing
3. Spending all time on content and no time on structure -- focus on tags and structure first, then content

## Computational thinking skills (KS2)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Abstraction (KS1)** — Focus on the most important features of a problem or task while ignoring unnecessary detail; represent real-world actions as simple step-by-step instructions that capture the essential logic without irrelevant specifics.
- **Abstraction (KS2)** — Design programs and digital solutions by identifying the key variables, inputs and outputs relevant to a problem while deliberately ignoring peripheral details; use procedures and functions as abstractions that hide implementation complexity; apply abstraction when planning programs using pseudocode or flowcharts.
- **Abstraction (KS3)** — Design and evaluate computational abstractions that model the state and behaviour of real-world problems and physical systems; select appropriate levels of abstraction for a given problem context; use abstract data types, classes and interfaces to hide implementation detail; understand the layered abstractions present in computing systems from hardware to application.
- **Decomposition (KS1)** — Break a familiar task or problem into a sequence of smaller, ordered steps; understand that a complex instruction can be split into simpler sub-instructions that together achieve the same goal; apply this thinking when giving instructions to a programmable toy or creating a simple program.
- **Decomposition (KS2)** — Decompose a complex programming problem or digital project into distinct, manageable sub-problems that can be developed and tested independently; plan program structure using top-down design before coding; use procedures and functions as the coded expression of decomposed sub-problems.
- **Decomposition (KS3)** — Design and develop modular programs that use procedures and functions to decompose complex problems; apply top-down and bottom-up design strategies; decompose data requirements as well as procedural logic, selecting appropriate data structures for each sub-problem; evaluate how modular decomposition improves code readability, maintainability and reuse.
