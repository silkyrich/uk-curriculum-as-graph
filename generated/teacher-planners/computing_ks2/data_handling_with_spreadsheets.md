## Concepts

This study delivers **0 primary concepts** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Secondary concept: Networks, the Internet and the World Wide Web (CO-KS12-C004)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

A computer network is a collection of computing devices connected together to share data and resources. The internet is the global network of networks, connecting millions of devices worldwide using a common set of protocols. The World Wide Web is a service built on the internet, comprising web pages accessed via browsers. Email, messaging and streaming are other internet services. At KS2, pupils develop conceptual understanding of how networks and the internet work, distinguishing between physical infrastructure and the services that run on top of it.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Understanding that computers can be connected together and that the internet allows people to share information across the world. | Thinking the internet and the World Wide Web are the same thing; Believing websites are 'inside' their own computer |
| **Developing** | Describing how networks work, including the roles of routers, servers and clients, and understanding that the web is a service that runs on the internet. | Using 'internet' and 'web' as if they mean the same thing; Not understanding that the internet existed before the World Wide Web |
| **Expected** | Explaining how data is transmitted across networks using packets and protocols, and understanding how search engines and websites work. | Thinking data travels as one continuous piece rather than in packets; Not understanding that packets can take different routes to the same destination |

## Thinking lens: Systems and System Models (primary)

**Key question:** What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?

**Why this lens fits:** Understanding the internet as a network requires pupils to model how devices, routers and servers interact as a system — each component has a role and the system's behaviour emerges from how the parts communicate.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- What goes into this system, and what comes out?
- If you changed this one part, what else would be affected?
- Where does this system start and end?
- How could we draw a model to explain how this works?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Evaluating search results critically requires pupils to assess the quality and reliability of evidence — deciding whether a source is trustworthy is an argument-evaluation task grounded in evidence appraisal.

## Session structure: Practical Application

### Practical Application
A hands-on sequence where pupils apply knowledge and skills to solve a practical problem or create a functional outcome. Begins with a real-world context, builds skills through rehearsal, guides design or planning, supports making or problem-solving, and concludes with evaluation against success criteria.

`context` → `skill_rehearsal` → `design` → `make_or_solve` → `evaluate`

**Assessment:** Practical outcome (solution, product, program) evaluated against defined success criteria, with written or verbal explanation of the process and decisions made.

**Teacher note:** Use the PRACTICAL APPLICATION template: set a real-world context or problem that requires pupils to apply knowledge and skills. Rehearse the key skills needed through guided practice. Support pupils in designing their approach, carrying out the practical task, and evaluating their outcome. Encourage them to explain what worked well and what they would improve.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What skills will you need to solve this problem?
- What is your plan, and why did you choose this approach?
- How well did your solution work?
- What would you change if you did it again?

## Computing focus

**Software/tool:** spreadsheet
**Computational concepts:** data representation, input output
**Abstraction level:** Visual
**Themes:** data handling, IT skills, digital literacy

---

## Why this study matters

Spreadsheets teach data handling in a computing context -- entering data, creating formulae, and generating charts. This connects computing to mathematics (data handling) and science (recording results). Pupils learn that software can process data automatically, which is the conceptual bridge to understanding what computers actually do -- process information according to rules.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Treating the spreadsheet as a table for typing in -- teach formulae as the point, not just cells
2. Formulae errors from wrong cell references -- teach cell naming and checking
3. Charts without titles or labels -- teach that data presentation requires context

---

## Computational thinking skills (KS2)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Abstraction (KS1)** — Focus on the most important features of a problem or task while ignoring unnecessary detail; represent real-world actions as simple step-by-step instructions that capture the essential logic without irrelevant specifics.
- **Abstraction (KS2)** — Design programs and digital solutions by identifying the key variables, inputs and outputs relevant to a problem while deliberately ignoring peripheral details; use procedures and functions as abstractions that hide implementation complexity; apply abstraction when planning programs using pseudocode or flowcharts.
- **Abstraction (KS3)** — Design and evaluate computational abstractions that model the state and behaviour of real-world problems and physical systems; select appropriate levels of abstraction for a given problem context; use abstract data types, classes and interfaces to hide implementation detail; understand the layered abstractions present in computing systems from hardware to application.
- **Decomposition (KS1)** — Break a familiar task or problem into a sequence of smaller, ordered steps; understand that a complex instruction can be split into simpler sub-instructions that together achieve the same goal; apply this thinking when giving instructions to a programmable toy or creating a simple program.
- **Decomposition (KS2)** — Decompose a complex programming problem or digital project into distinct, manageable sub-problems that can be developed and tested independently; plan program structure using top-down design before coding; use procedures and functions as the coded expression of decomposed sub-problems.
- **Decomposition (KS3)** — Design and develop modular programs that use procedures and functions to decompose complex problems; apply top-down and bottom-up design strategies; decompose data requirements as well as procedural logic, selecting appropriate data structures for each sub-problem; evaluate how modular decomposition improves code readability, maintainability and reuse.

| Reading level | Fluent Reader (Emerging) (Lexile 300–500) |
| Text-to-speech | Available |
| Max sentence length | 18 words |
| Vocabulary | Curriculum vocabulary expected to be known (with in-context reminder). Some academic vocabulary (e.g., 'evidence', 'conclusion') acceptable. Technical terms in context. |
| Scaffolding level | Moderate |
| Hint tiers | 3 tiers |
| Session length | 15–25 minutes |
| Worked examples | Required — Text-based with inline questions. Not fully narrated — child reads the example. |
| Feedback tone | Respectful And Precise |
| Normalize struggle | Yes |
| Example correct feedback | *Your inference was correct — the text never said the character was nervous, but you worked it out from the clues: the short sentences and the word 'paced'. That is sophisticated reading.* |
| Example error feedback | *This is a common misconception: plants do not get their food from the soil — they make it from sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. The soil provides minerals, but food is made in the leaves.* |
