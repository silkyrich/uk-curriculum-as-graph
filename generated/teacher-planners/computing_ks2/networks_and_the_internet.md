## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **0 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Networks, the Internet and the World Wide Web (CO-KS12-C004)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

A computer network is a collection of computing devices connected together to share data and resources. The internet is the global network of networks, connecting millions of devices worldwide using a common set of protocols. The World Wide Web is a service built on the internet, comprising web pages accessed via browsers. Email, messaging and streaming are other internet services. At KS2, pupils develop conceptual understanding of how networks and the internet work, distinguishing between physical infrastructure and the services that run on top of it.

**Teaching guidance:** Use diagrams to show how devices are connected in a local network and how local networks connect via the internet. Discuss the difference between the internet (the physical and logical infrastructure) and the web (a service accessed via the internet). Explore how data travels across the internet in packets. Investigate the role of search engines and how they index and rank pages. Connect to digital safety: understanding how the internet works underpins understanding of online privacy and data. Use analogies: the postal system as an analogy for internet protocols.

**Key vocabulary:** network, internet, World Wide Web, website, browser, server, router, packet, protocol, IP address, search engine, hyperlink, URL, data, bandwidth

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often confuse the internet with the World Wide Web, using the terms interchangeably. Establishing that the web is one service on the internet (alongside email, streaming etc.) is a key conceptual correction. Pupils may think the internet is a physical 'place' rather than a network of connected devices; using physical metaphors (roads, postal networks) helps make the infrastructure tangible. The idea that data travels in packets, potentially by different routes, is counterintuitive to many pupils.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Understanding that computers can be connected together and that the internet allows people to share information across the world. | What happens when you type a website address into a computer? | Thinking the internet and the World Wide Web are the same thing; Believing websites are 'inside' their own computer |
| **Developing** | Describing how networks work, including the roles of routers, servers and clients, and understanding that the web is a service that runs on the internet. | Explain the difference between the internet and the World Wide Web. What role does a server play? | Using 'internet' and 'web' as if they mean the same thing; Not understanding that the internet existed before the World Wide Web |
| **Expected** | Explaining how data is transmitted across networks using packets and protocols, and understanding how search engines and websites work. | When you send an email, how does it get from your computer to someone else's? What are packets? | Thinking data travels as one continuous piece rather than in packets; Not understanding that packets can take different routes to the same destination |

> **Model response (Entry):** *The computer sends a message through the internet to another computer (a server) that has the website stored on it. That computer sends the website back so I can see it on my screen.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *The internet is the physical network of connected computers around the world. The World Wide Web is a service that runs on the internet — it's the collection of websites you can visit with a browser. A server is a computer that stores websites and sends them to your computer (the client) when you request them. Email is another service that uses the internet but isn't part of the web.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *When I send an email, my computer breaks the message into small pieces called packets. Each packet is labelled with the destination address and sent across the internet. Different packets might take different routes. The receiving computer reassembles the packets in the right order. Protocols like TCP/IP are the rules that ensure packets are sent, received and reassembled correctly.*

## Thinking lens: Systems and System Models (primary)

**Key question:** What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?

**Why this lens fits:** Understanding the internet as a network requires pupils to model how devices, routers and servers interact as a system — each component has a role and the system's behaviour emerges from how the parts communicate.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- What goes into this system, and what comes out?
- If you changed this one part, what else would be affected?
- Where does this system start and end?
- How could we draw a model to explain how this works?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Evaluating search results critically requires pupils to assess the quality and reliability of evidence — deciding whether a source is trustworthy is an argument-evaluation task grounded in evidence appraisal.

## Session structure: Research Enquiry

### Research Enquiry
A structured approach to answering questions through secondary research. Pupils formulate a research question, select appropriate sources, take and organise notes, synthesise findings from multiple sources, and present their conclusions. Develops information literacy alongside subject knowledge.

`question` → `source_selection` → `note_taking` → `synthesis` → `presentation`

**Assessment:** Research report or presentation that answers the original question using evidence from multiple sources, with evaluation of source reliability where appropriate.

**Teacher note:** Use the RESEARCH ENQUIRY template: give pupils a clear question to research using books, websites, or other provided sources. Teach them to select relevant information, make brief notes in their own words, and organise their findings. Guide them to present what they have learned clearly, distinguishing between what different sources say.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What question are we trying to answer?
- Which sources are most useful for answering this question?
- Can you put the key information into your own words?
- What did you find out, and which source told you that?

## Computing focus

**Computational concepts:** networking, data representation
**Abstraction level:** Visual
**Themes:** networks, internet, digital literacy

## Why this study matters

Understanding how the internet works is foundational to digital literacy and online safety. Pupils learn that the internet is a physical network of connected devices, that data travels in packets, and that the World Wide Web is one service running on the internet (alongside email, streaming, etc.). Role-play activities where pupils act as routers, servers, and clients make the abstract infrastructure tangible.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Conflating 'the internet' with 'the web' -- explicitly distinguish infrastructure from service
2. Too abstract -- use physical role-play: pupils pass paper 'packets' to each other
3. Not connecting to safety -- 'now you know how data travels, what happens to your personal information?'

## Computational thinking skills (KS2)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Abstraction (KS1)** — Focus on the most important features of a problem or task while ignoring unnecessary detail; represent real-world actions as simple step-by-step instructions that capture the essential logic without irrelevant specifics.
- **Abstraction (KS2)** — Design programs and digital solutions by identifying the key variables, inputs and outputs relevant to a problem while deliberately ignoring peripheral details; use procedures and functions as abstractions that hide implementation complexity; apply abstraction when planning programs using pseudocode or flowcharts.
- **Abstraction (KS3)** — Design and evaluate computational abstractions that model the state and behaviour of real-world problems and physical systems; select appropriate levels of abstraction for a given problem context; use abstract data types, classes and interfaces to hide implementation detail; understand the layered abstractions present in computing systems from hardware to application.
- **Decomposition (KS1)** — Break a familiar task or problem into a sequence of smaller, ordered steps; understand that a complex instruction can be split into simpler sub-instructions that together achieve the same goal; apply this thinking when giving instructions to a programmable toy or creating a simple program.
- **Decomposition (KS2)** — Decompose a complex programming problem or digital project into distinct, manageable sub-problems that can be developed and tested independently; plan program structure using top-down design before coding; use procedures and functions as the coded expression of decomposed sub-problems.
- **Decomposition (KS3)** — Design and develop modular programs that use procedures and functions to decompose complex problems; apply top-down and bottom-up design strategies; decompose data requirements as well as procedural logic, selecting appropriate data structures for each sub-problem; evaluate how modular decomposition improves code readability, maintainability and reuse.
