## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **3 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Poetry and play performance (EN-Y3-C022)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Pupils prepare and perform poems and play scripts showing understanding through intonation, tone, volume and action, using drama approaches to explore meaning

**Teaching guidance:** Provide regular opportunities for children to rehearse and perform poems and play scripts. Teach performance skills: using voice (volume, pace, pause, intonation) and body (gesture, movement, facial expression) to bring a text to life. Begin with choral speaking of poems before moving to individual or small-group performances. Discuss how a performer's choices affect the audience's experience. Use readers' theatre with play scripts, assigning roles and practising expressive reading before performing to an audience.

**Key vocabulary:** perform, rehearse, expression, intonation, volume, pace, gesture, audience, script, poem, voice

**Common misconceptions:** Children may recite poems or read scripts in a flat monotone without expression. They may rush through a performance because of nervousness. Some children focus on memorisation at the expense of expression and meaning. Others may add exaggerated actions that distract from the text rather than enhancing it.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Reading a poem aloud with some awareness of rhythm, varying volume for emphasis. | Read this short poem aloud. Try to follow the rhythm — let the words bounce along. | Reading the poem as if it were prose, ignoring line breaks and rhythm; Reading in a singsong voice that emphasises rhythm at the expense of meaning |
| **Developing** | Preparing a poem or play script for performance, making deliberate choices about voice and expression. | With your group, prepare this poem for performance. Decide who says which lines and how you will use your voices. | All reading together in unison without varying delivery; Focusing on memorisation at the expense of expression |
| **Expected** | Performing poems and play scripts with intonation, tone, volume and action that show understanding of meaning. | Perform this poem to the class. Your voice and actions should show you understand what the poem means and how the poet wants the audience to feel. | Reciting from memory accurately but without expression; Using exaggerated actions that distract from the poem's meaning |
| **Greater Depth** | Interpreting poems and scripts through performance choices, explaining why specific performance decisions enhance meaning. | Perform the poem in two different ways — one version should feel sad and one should feel angry. Explain what you changed and why. | Performing differently but not being able to articulate what changed and why; Making superficial changes (just volume) rather than changing pace, pause and emphasis |

> **Model response (Entry):** *Child reads with some awareness of the poem's rhythmic pattern, speaking clearly.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Group assigns parts, rehearses with varied volume and pace, and performs with some expression and coordination.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Child performs with deliberate pauses, varied pace (fast for exciting parts, slow for sad parts), gestures that enhance meaning, and expression that conveys the poem's mood.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *Performs both versions, then explains: 'For the sad version, I spoke slowly and quietly, dropping my voice at the end of each line. For the angry version, I spoke faster and louder, emphasising the strong words. The poem works both ways because the character has lost something — they could be grieving or furious.'*

### Secondary concept: Effective language in texts (EN-Y3-C023)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Pupils identify and appreciate effective language choices, discussing words and phrases that capture the reader's interest and imagination

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying a word or phrase that stands out in a text and saying whether they like it. | Choosing a word because it's long or unusual rather than because of its effect; Saying 'I like it' without any explanation |
| **Developing** | Identifying effective language and beginning to explain what effect it creates. | Saying the word is 'descriptive' without explaining the specific effect; Identifying the technique (personification) without discussing its effect |
| **Expected** | Discussing the effect of specific language choices, explaining how words and phrases capture the reader's interest and create imagery. | Finding effective language but only being able to say it's 'good' or 'describes things well'; Identifying techniques by name without explaining their effect on the reader |
| **Greater Depth** | Analysing how language choices work together to create an overall effect, and applying techniques from reading to own writing. | Analysing individual word choices without seeing how they work together; Understanding the analysis but not being able to apply the same techniques in own writing |

### Secondary concept: Forms of poetry (EN-Y3-C024)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Pupils recognise and understand different poetic forms and their characteristics, including free verse and narrative poetry

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recognising that poems can have different forms and that not all poems rhyme. | Saying the non-rhyming text isn't a poem because it doesn't rhyme; Not being able to identify what makes the non-rhyming text a poem |
| **Developing** | Identifying different poetic forms (haiku, acrostic, rhyming poem, free verse) and their basic characteristics. | Confusing poetic forms with each other; Identifying the form by name but not knowing its characteristics |
| **Expected** | Understanding how poetic form shapes content and writing poems in different forms with awareness of their conventions. | Writing the haiku with the wrong syllable count; Writing free verse that reads like prose with line breaks |
| **Greater Depth** | Explaining why a poet might choose a particular form and evaluating how form enhances meaning. | Discussing the form's features without connecting them to the poem's meaning; Saying the form was chosen because the poet 'likes' that form rather than for artistic reasons |

### Secondary concept: Reading aloud own writing (EN-Y3-C053)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Pupils present their writing orally with appropriate intonation, tone and volume so that meaning is clear to a group or the whole class

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Reading a short piece of own writing aloud to a partner, audibly and without rushing. | Reading too quietly for the partner to hear; Rushing through the reading without pausing at punctuation |
| **Developing** | Reading a paragraph of own writing aloud to a small group, using punctuation to guide pauses and intonation. | Ignoring punctuation and reading in a continuous stream; Reading in a monotone without varying intonation for different sentence types |
| **Expected** | Reading own writing aloud to the class with appropriate intonation, tone and volume that convey meaning and engage the audience. | Reading with expression at the start but reverting to a monotone as concentration on reading takes over; Performing so dramatically that the meaning becomes unclear |
| **Greater Depth** | Presenting writing to an audience with confident, expressive delivery, using the reading aloud as an opportunity to evaluate the writing's effectiveness. | Not paying attention to audience reaction as feedback on the writing; Being unable to connect the experience of reading aloud to revision decisions |

## Thinking lens: Perspective and Interpretation (primary)

**Key question:** Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?

**Why this lens fits:** Reading across genres and for different purposes develops pupils' capacity to adopt different reading stances — the reader of fiction interprets character and theme while the reader of non-fiction evaluates information.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- Who wrote or made this, and why?
- What might they have left out?
- How does this account compare to another version of the same event?
- What experience or belief might have shaped this person's view?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Drawing inferences with evidence and identifying main ideas are explicitly evidence-grounded skills — pupils must locate textual support for their interpretive claims, not just state what they think.

---

## Session structure: Creative Response

### Creative Response
A creative arts or writing sequence that develops technique through exposure to exemplary work, guided exploration of techniques, structured planning, independent creation, and peer critique. Balances creative freedom with technical skill development.

`exemplar_exposure` → `technique_exploration` → `planning` → `creating` → `critique`

**Assessment:** Final creative outcome (artwork, design, written piece) accompanied by a reflective evaluation discussing techniques used, influences, and areas for development.

**Teacher note:** Use the CREATIVE RESPONSE template: share exemplar artworks or texts and guide pupils to identify specific techniques used. Provide structured opportunities to experiment with those techniques. Support planning and creating an original response that demonstrates conscious technical choices. Include time for constructive peer critique focused on the effectiveness of specific techniques.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What technique has the artist or writer used here?
- How could you use this technique in your own work?
- What choices have you made, and why?
- What feedback would help improve this piece?

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Poetry
**Features to teach:** visual layout as part of meaning (shape poems), imagery and descriptive language, figurative language (simile introduction), word choice for effect

**Writing outcome:** Write at least 2 poems: one shape poem where the layout reflects the subject, and one using similes, then perform one to an audience with expression

**Grammar focus:** expanded noun phrases for description, simile using 'like' and 'as', prepositions for precise description
*(from Y3 Appendix 2)*

**Literary terms:** simile, imagery, stanza, verse, calligram, shape poem

---

## Suggested texts

- **The Works: Poems for Key Stage 2** by Pie Corbett (ed.) — Wide range of forms including shape poems and calligrams
- **Falling Out of the Sky** by Rachel Rooney — Inventive forms with strong imagery

---

## Genre

- **Poetry:** Literature using rhythm, imagery, and condensed language to convey meaning and emotion. Poetry is continuous across all key stages with no progression break, but expectations increase: from recitation and simple pattern-following (KS1) through multiple forms and figurative language (KS2) to analysis of poetic conventions and unseen poetry comparison (KS4).

---

## Why this study matters

Shape poems and calligrams make the connection between form and meaning visible and concrete. At Y3, this is an accessible way to teach that poetic form is a deliberate choice that shapes how the reader experiences the poem. Similes are introduced as the first explicit figurative language device because 'like' and 'as' provide clear signals that make the device identifiable.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Shape poems become about drawing the shape rather than crafting the language
2. Similes are formulaic ('as big as a house') rather than original and precise
3. Performance is rushed through without attention to pace, volume, and expression

---

## Reading and writing skills (KS2)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Word meaning from context** — Understand the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in simple texts by using the surrounding context, including pictures and sentence sense, to make a reasonable guess at what the word means.
- **Information retrieval from simple texts** — Find and report specific information or key facts from a short piece of fiction or non-fiction, identifying the part of the text where the answer is located.
- **Retelling and sequencing** — Retell the main events of a story or the key steps in a non-fiction text, placing them in the correct order and identifying the most important ideas.
- **Simple inference from text** — Use clues in the text — characters' words, actions and feelings — to work out something the author has not stated directly, and begin to explain the reasoning behind that interpretation.
- **Prediction from text clues** — Predict what is likely to happen next in a story or sequence of events, drawing on what has already been read and on prior knowledge of similar texts and situations.
- **Noticing interesting words and phrases** — Identify and discuss words and phrases that capture attention or create an effect, beginning to explain what makes them interesting, surprising or effective in the context of the text.

|-----------|--------|
| Reading level | Developing Reader (Lexile 150–350) |
| Text-to-speech | Available |
| Max sentence length | 14 words |
| Vocabulary | Subject vocabulary with inline glossary support. Abstract concepts grounded in familiar contexts. Similes and comparisons helpful (e.g., 'solid is like a brick'). |
| Scaffolding level | Moderate To High |
| Hint tiers | 3 tiers |
| Session length | 12–20 minutes |
| Worked examples | Required — Text + diagram narrated. Step-by-step with child input at key points ('What would you do next?'). |
