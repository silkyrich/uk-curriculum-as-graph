## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Reading breadth: wide range of fiction and non-fiction (EN-Y6-C017)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

By Year 6, pupils are expected to have encountered and independently engaged with a broad range of reading material, including myths, legends, traditional stories, modern fiction, fiction from literary heritage, books from other cultures and traditions, poetry, plays, non-fiction reference books and textbooks. Mastery means pupils read extensively and with genuine understanding across all these forms, recommending books with reasons, comparing texts across genres and traditions, and bringing their reading experience to bear in discussion and in their own writing.

**Teaching guidance:** Maintain a class reading record that tracks the range of genres and traditions pupils have encountered. Include whole-class reads, independent choice, and teacher read-alouds to ensure breadth beyond individual preferences. Discuss books from other cultures, including translated texts, to broaden pupils' sense of world literature. Make explicit connections between reading experience and writing: 'The author of this book does X — could you try that technique?' Ensure non-fiction is given equal status as reading for pleasure and for learning, using high-quality non-fiction texts across subjects.

**Key vocabulary:** genre, fiction, non-fiction, myth, legend, tradition, heritage, literary, culture, compare, recommend, breadth

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils and teachers sometimes equate reading breadth with quantity, valuing number of books over depth of engagement. Wide reading does not mean surface reading — reading broadly and deeply are not in opposition. Some pupils develop preferences that narrow their reading range; structured exposure to different genres and traditions prevents this.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Reads from at least two different text types (e.g. fiction and non-fiction) when directed, and can name the type of text they are reading. | This week, choose one fiction book and one non-fiction book from the class library. After reading both, write one sentence about each explaining what type of text it is. | Identifies the text type but confuses fiction based on real events with non-fiction; Reads two books of the same type without recognising the lack of range |
| **Developing** | Reads across at least four text types (fiction, non-fiction, poetry, and one other such as plays or reference texts) and can describe how each type requires different reading approaches. | Look at your reading record for this half-term. Have you read from at least four different types of text? For each type, explain one way you read it differently from the others. | Lists the texts but does not reflect on different reading approaches required by each type; Reads four texts but all within fiction, counting different genres as different 'types' |
| **Expected** | Reads genuinely widely across fiction, non-fiction, poetry, plays, and reference materials from different genres, periods and cultures, selecting texts for both pleasure and purpose. Articulates the value of reading breadth and makes connections across texts. | Create a reading map for this term showing at least six texts you have read. For each, note the text type, genre, period or cultural origin, why you chose it, and one connection you can make to another text on your map. | Lists a wide range but cannot make meaningful connections between texts from different types or cultures; Treats breadth as a tick-box exercise rather than reflecting on what each type of reading offers |
| **Greater Depth** | Reads widely and independently with genuine intellectual curiosity, actively seeking texts beyond the familiar. Reflects critically on how reading different genres, periods and cultures broadens understanding, and advocates for reading breadth with specific examples. | Write a short piece for younger pupils explaining why it matters to read widely. Use examples from your own reading to show how different types of text have changed the way you think about something. | Makes general claims about reading being 'good for you' without specific examples of how different texts contributed different understanding; Confuses reading widely with reading a large quantity of the same type of text |

> **Model response (Entry):** *I read 'Kensuke's Kingdom' which is fiction because it is a made-up adventure story. I also read 'Extreme Planet' which is non-fiction because it gives real facts about weather.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *I read a novel (Holes), a non-fiction book about the Amazon, a poetry collection by Roger McGough, and a play script (Macbeth for Kids). I read the novel from start to finish to follow the plot. The non-fiction I dipped in and out of using the index. The poetry I read aloud to hear the rhythm. The play script I read imagining different voices for each character.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *1. 'Refugee Boy' by Benjamin Zephaniah (contemporary fiction, British-Ethiopian setting) - chosen for class reading; connects to the newspaper article about refugees because both show what it means to leave home. 2. Newspaper article on refugee crisis (non-fiction, current affairs) - read during guided reading; connects to Refugee Boy for the same topic from a factual perspective. 3. 'The Highwayman' by Alfred Noyes (narrative poem, early 20th century) - chosen because we studied ballads; connects to the play script because both use dramatic tension. 4. Macbeth adapted script (play, Shakespeare, 17th century) - class drama; connects to Greek myths because both feature ambition and downfall. 5. 'Greek Myths' retold by Marcia Williams (traditional stories, Ancient Greek) - chosen for personal reading; connects to Macbeth through the theme of hubris. 6. Encyclopaedia Britannica online entry on volcanoes (reference, contemporary) - used for geography homework; connects to the non-fiction book because both present factual information but in different formats.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *Reading widely matters because each type of text teaches you something different. When I read 'Private Peaceful' by Michael Morpurgo, I understood World War One through one soldier's fear. But when I read the non-fiction book 'The War to End All Wars', I understood the same war through facts, maps and photographs. Neither gave the full picture alone: the novel made me feel it, the non-fiction made me understand it. Reading poetry by Grace Nichols taught me that language can carry the rhythm of Caribbean speech, which I would never have discovered if I only read books by British authors. And reading a play script taught me that words on a page are instructions for performance, not just something to read quietly. Every type of text opens a door that the others cannot.*

### Secondary concept: Understanding plot and narrative structure (EN-Y6-C019)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

By Year 6, pupils can identify and analyse the structural features of narrative texts: orientation, complication, rising action, climax, resolution and coda. Mastery means pupils can trace how a plot develops across a whole text, explain why events are sequenced as they are, identify foreshadowing and flashback techniques, and evaluate how structural choices affect the reader's engagement and experience. Pupils can compare how different authors structure narratives for different effects.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifies the beginning, middle and end of a story, and can retell the main events in sequence. | Includes too many minor details instead of identifying main events; Retells events out of sequence |
| **Developing** | Identifies narrative stages beyond beginning-middle-end, using terms such as opening, build-up, problem, climax and resolution, and can label these stages in a text. | Confuses the build-up with the problem, labelling the first difficulty as the main problem; Identifies the climax as the final event rather than the moment of highest tension |
| **Expected** | Identifies and names the full range of narrative structure elements (orientation, complication, rising action, climax, falling action, resolution, and where present, denouement) and explains how the structure shapes the reader's experience. | Labels the stages correctly but does not explain how the structure affects the reader's experience; Treats narrative structure as a fixed template rather than recognising that authors vary it deliberately |
| **Greater Depth** | Analyses how authors manipulate, subvert or layer narrative structure for deliberate effect, comparing structural choices across texts and evaluating how non-linear or unconventional structures create different kinds of meaning. | Describes the structures accurately but does not evaluate why the author chose them or what they add to meaning; Assumes conventional structure is always less sophisticated than experimental structure |

### Secondary concept: Understanding character and characterisation (EN-Y6-C021)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

By Year 6, pupils can identify and evaluate the techniques authors use to develop character — direct description, dialogue, action, reaction of other characters, interior monologue — and can analyse how a character changes or develops across a text. Mastery means pupils can draw complex inferences about characters' motivations and values from implicit clues in the text, compare characters within and across texts, and use appropriate evidence and terminology to support their characterisation analysis.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifies what a character is like using direct description from the text, picking out words and phrases the author uses to describe the character. | Describes what the character does rather than what the author tells us about them; States a trait ('she is clever') without pointing to the words in the text that show this |
| **Developing** | Identifies characterisation through at least two methods (direct description, dialogue, action, or other characters' reactions) and explains what each reveals about the character. | Identifies only one method of characterisation and repeats it; Describes the character's traits without linking them to specific evidence from the text |
| **Expected** | Identifies and evaluates the full range of characterisation techniques (direct description, dialogue, action, other characters' responses, internal thought) and explains how the author uses 'show, don't tell' to build a complex, layered character. | Lists the techniques without evaluating how they work together to create a unified impression; Explains 'show, don't tell' as a rule rather than analysing how the author applies it in specific moments |
| **Greater Depth** | Evaluates how authors create complex, contradictory or developing characters, analysing how characterisation techniques serve the narrative's wider themes and comparing approaches across texts. | Compares characters rather than comparing the techniques the authors use to create those characters; Discusses character change without connecting it to the author's wider thematic purpose |

### Secondary concept: Presentation, performance and formal public speaking (EN-Y6-C045)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

By Year 6, pupils can deliver formal presentations and performances with command, clarity and audience awareness, adapting their spoken language for public, formal contexts. Mastery means pupils speak with confidence, control pace and volume, use formal vocabulary and registers deliberately, maintain the interest of their audience through varied tone and appropriate use of gesture and eye contact, and handle questions and follow-up with composure. This is the culmination of the spoken language curriculum's requirement for pupils to 'gain, maintain and monitor the interest of the listener.'

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Delivering a short prepared talk to the class with clear speech, audible volume and basic structure (introduction, main points, ending). | Reading word for word from a full script rather than using prompt cards as memory aids; Speaking too quietly or too quickly for the audience to follow |
| **Developing** | Delivering a prepared presentation with some attention to audience engagement, using deliberate eye contact, varied pace and appropriate formality for the context. | Mixing informal language into a formal presentation without noticing the register shift; Making eye contact with only the teacher rather than scanning the whole audience |
| **Expected** | Delivering formal presentations with command and clarity, adapting register to audience, using rhetorical techniques such as repetition, rhetorical questions or the rule of three, and responding confidently to audience questions. | Presenting arguments without anticipating or addressing likely counter-arguments; Dropping into informal register when answering questions after maintaining formality during the speech |
| **Greater Depth** | Delivering presentations with confidence, artistry and adaptive audience awareness, adjusting content and register in real time based on audience response, and critically evaluating the effectiveness of their own and others' presentations. | Evaluating performance in vague terms such as 'I spoke clearly' without identifying specific rhetorical techniques and their impact; Focusing only on content accuracy rather than analysing how delivery choices affected the audience |

### Secondary concept: Drama: performance, role play and improvisation (EN-Y6-C048)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

By Year 6, pupils participate in a range of dramatic activities — including role play, improvisation, script reading, and performance — using their voices, movement and expression to communicate character, mood and meaning. Mastery means pupils can commit to a dramatic role with confidence, adapt their spoken language and non-verbal communication for performance contexts, and use drama as a tool for exploring ideas, perspectives and texts. Drama experience directly supports the spoken language curriculum's requirements for public speaking, performance and debate.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Participating in simple role-play activities, staying in character and using voice and body language to convey a role, with teacher direction. | Breaking out of character to answer as themselves rather than as the wolf; Giving one-word answers without elaborating on the character's perspective or motivations |
| **Developing** | Using drama techniques such as freeze-frame, thought-tracking and role-play to explore characters and situations from texts, showing understanding of different perspectives. | All characters expressing the same emotion rather than showing distinct perspectives; Thought-tracking that describes what happened in the plot rather than revealing the character's inner feelings |
| **Expected** | Using drama as a tool for learning across the curriculum, sustaining character, improvising responses to unexpected situations, and reflecting on how drama deepens understanding of texts and topics. | Treating drama as entertainment rather than using it to explore the topic more deeply; Breaking character or laughing through the scene without committing to the learning purpose |
| **Greater Depth** | Directing and evaluating drama, making deliberate choices about staging, characterisation and dramatic techniques to convey meaning, and analysing how drama contributes to understanding that other learning methods do not. | Making staging decisions based on what looks interesting rather than what conveys the meaning of the scene; Evaluating the scene only in terms of acting quality rather than analysing how directorial choices affected the audience's understanding |

---

## Thinking lens: Perspective and Interpretation (primary)

**Key question:** Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?

**Why this lens fits:** Formal presentations and collaborative discussion require pupils to consider how their contribution will be received and to engage with opposing viewpoints — both demand sustained attention to audience perspective.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- Who wrote or made this, and why?
- What might they have left out?
- How does this account compare to another version of the same event?
- What experience or belief might have shaped this person's view?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Formal debate is structured argumentation — pupils must construct, sequence and defend claims with evidence in real time, making this cluster a direct application of evidence_argument in spoken form.

## Session structure: Text Study

### Text Study
A reading-to-writing cycle for primary and KS3 English. Begins with shared or guided reading of a high-quality text, moves through analysis of language features and authorial choices, builds vocabulary, then scaffolds the writing process from planning through drafting to editing and publication.

`shared_reading` → `analysis` → `vocabulary` → `planning` → `drafting` → `editing`

**Assessment:** Final written outcome in the genre studied, demonstrating understanding of text features, appropriate vocabulary use, and effective application of the writing process.

**Teacher note:** Use the TEXT STUDY template: share a quality text and guide pupils to analyse the author's choices — vocabulary, sentence structure, and literary techniques. Build subject-specific vocabulary through discussion. Support pupils in planning and drafting their own writing, applying techniques they have identified. Include time for editing and improving their work.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What effect does the author create with this word or phrase?
- Why did the author structure the text this way?
- What technique could you borrow for your own writing?
- How could you improve this section of your draft?

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Drama
**Features to teach:** Shakespearean language and vocabulary, play structure (acts, scenes, stage directions), dramatic irony and comedy, character relationships and conflict, performance interpretation

**Writing outcome:** Write a modern retelling of one scene from A Midsummer Night's Dream (400-600 words) or a character diary entry exploring a character's motives and feelings

**Grammar focus:** direct speech punctuation in playscript format, formal and archaic vocabulary, exclamation for dramatic effect
*(from Y6 Appendix 2)*

**Literary terms:** soliloquy, aside, dramatic irony, comedy, tragedy, act, scene, stage direction

---

## Suggested texts

- **A Midsummer Night's Dream (Usborne Illustrated)** by William Shakespeare / Rosie Dickins — Accessible illustrated adaptation with original language extracts
- **A Midsummer Night's Dream (Shakespeare Stories)** by Andrew Matthews / Tony Ross — Narrative retelling that preserves key language and plot

---

## Genre

- **Playscript:** Texts written for performance with dialogue, stage directions, and dramatic structure. At KS1-KS2, playscripts are a writing form that teaches dialogue conventions and text layout. At KS3, script writing develops into a compositional form with dramatic purpose and audience awareness.
- **Drama:** Dramatic literature studied for its theatrical and literary qualities. Distinct from KS1-KS2 playscript writing: at KS3-KS4, drama means studying published plays as literary texts, analysing dramatic conventions, and understanding performance context. Shakespeare study is the dominant form at KS4.

---

## Why this study matters

While Shakespeare is not statutory until KS3, the vast majority of primary schools introduce Shakespeare in Y6 as preparation for secondary school. A Midsummer Night's Dream is the most popular choice because its comedy, magic, and mistaken identity are accessible to 10-11 year olds. The performance element develops spoken language skills and confidence. Encountering Shakespearean language at Y6 reduces the anxiety of meeting it at KS3.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Too much time spent on plot comprehension, too little on language exploration and performance
2. Shakespearean language presented as incomprehensible rather than as a puzzle to be decoded
3. Writing task defaults to plot summary rather than creative response or analytical diary entry

---

## Cross-curricular opportunities

| Link | Subject | Connection | Strength |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| British History Beyond 1066 | History | Tudor and Jacobean theatre — the Globe, Elizabethan audience | Moderate |

---

## Reading and writing skills (KS2)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Word meaning from context** — Understand the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in simple texts by using the surrounding context, including pictures and sentence sense, to make a reasonable guess at what the word means.
- **Information retrieval from simple texts** — Find and report specific information or key facts from a short piece of fiction or non-fiction, identifying the part of the text where the answer is located.
- **Retelling and sequencing** — Retell the main events of a story or the key steps in a non-fiction text, placing them in the correct order and identifying the most important ideas.
- **Simple inference from text** — Use clues in the text — characters' words, actions and feelings — to work out something the author has not stated directly, and begin to explain the reasoning behind that interpretation.
- **Prediction from text clues** — Predict what is likely to happen next in a story or sequence of events, drawing on what has already been read and on prior knowledge of similar texts and situations.
- **Noticing interesting words and phrases** — Identify and discuss words and phrases that capture attention or create an effect, beginning to explain what makes them interesting, surprising or effective in the context of the text.
