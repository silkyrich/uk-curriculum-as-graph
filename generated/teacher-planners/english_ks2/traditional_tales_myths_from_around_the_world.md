## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **5 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Fairy stories, myths and legends (EN-Y3-C020)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Pupils build familiarity with traditional literature including fairy stories, myths and legends from various traditions, and retell some of these orally

**Teaching guidance:** Introduce and explore fairy stories, myths and legends as distinct literary forms. Teach the conventions of each: fairy stories have magic, good vs evil, repeated patterns ('Once upon a time...'); myths explain natural phenomena and involve gods or supernatural beings; legends are stories about heroic or historical figures that may have some basis in truth. Read examples from different cultures. Discuss how these stories pass down cultural values and beliefs. Use as models for children's own writing.

**Key vocabulary:** fairy story, myth, legend, traditional tale, character, hero, villain, moral, magic, convention, retell

**Common misconceptions:** Children often use 'fairy tale', 'myth' and 'legend' interchangeably without understanding the distinctions. They may think myths are simply 'untrue stories' rather than narratives that served cultural or explanatory purposes. Some children assume all traditional stories come from one culture.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Listening to and enjoying a fairy story, myth or legend read aloud, identifying basic features. | I've just read you the Greek myth about Icarus. What magical or supernatural thing happened in the story? | Retelling the whole plot instead of identifying the supernatural element; Not distinguishing between realistic and fantastical elements |
| **Developing** | Recognising the characteristics of fairy stories, myths and legends as distinct forms of traditional literature. | How do you know this is a myth rather than a fairy story? What features tell you? | Using 'myth' and 'fairy tale' interchangeably; Identifying features of the text type but not being able to explain why those features matter |
| **Expected** | Comparing traditional stories from different cultures, retelling key stories orally, and identifying common themes across traditions. | We've read a Norse myth and a Greek myth. What do they have in common? How are they different? | Comparing plot details rather than thematic and structural similarities; Only identifying similarities without noting differences, or vice versa |
| **Greater Depth** | Analysing why traditional stories endure and what they reveal about the culture they come from, making connections to modern stories that use similar patterns. | Why do you think people still read myths that are thousands of years old? Can you think of a modern story that uses similar patterns? | Saying myths are interesting without explaining why they endure; Making superficial connections to modern stories based on plot similarity only |

> **Model response (Entry):** *'Daedalus made wings out of feathers and wax so they could fly like birds. That's magical because people can't really fly.'*

> **Model response (Developing):** *'It's a myth because it explains why something in nature happens — why the seasons change. It has gods and supernatural beings, not fairies and princes. It comes from an ancient culture.'*

> **Model response (Expected):** *'Both have powerful gods who control nature, and both explain why things happen in the world. But the Norse gods seem more like warriors and the Greek gods are more like humans with superpowers. Both cultures used myths to teach lessons about how to behave.'*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *'Myths deal with big questions that still matter — why the world is the way it is, what makes someone a hero, what happens when you're too proud. The myth of Icarus is about not being reckless, and that's still relevant. Modern stories like Harry Potter use the same hero's journey pattern — an ordinary person called to an adventure, facing trials, and returning changed.'*

## Thinking lens: Perspective and Interpretation (primary)

**Key question:** Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?

**Why this lens fits:** Reading across genres and for different purposes develops pupils' capacity to adopt different reading stances — the reader of fiction interprets character and theme while the reader of non-fiction evaluates information.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- Who wrote or made this, and why?
- What might they have left out?
- How does this account compare to another version of the same event?
- What experience or belief might have shaped this person's view?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Drawing inferences with evidence and identifying main ideas are explicitly evidence-grounded skills — pupils must locate textual support for their interpretive claims, not just state what they think.

## Session structure: Text Study

### Text Study
A reading-to-writing cycle for primary and KS3 English. Begins with shared or guided reading of a high-quality text, moves through analysis of language features and authorial choices, builds vocabulary, then scaffolds the writing process from planning through drafting to editing and publication.

`shared_reading` → `analysis` → `vocabulary` → `planning` → `drafting` → `editing`

**Assessment:** Final written outcome in the genre studied, demonstrating understanding of text features, appropriate vocabulary use, and effective application of the writing process.

**Teacher note:** Use the TEXT STUDY template: share a quality text and guide pupils to analyse the author's choices — vocabulary, sentence structure, and literary techniques. Build subject-specific vocabulary through discussion. Support pupils in planning and drafting their own writing, applying techniques they have identified. Include time for editing and improving their work.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What effect does the author create with this word or phrase?
- Why did the author structure the text this way?
- What technique could you borrow for your own writing?
- How could you improve this section of your draft?

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Fiction
**Features to teach:** supernatural elements (gods, monsters, magic), heroic quest structure, moral or origin explanation, archetypal characters (hero, trickster, wise old figure)

**Writing outcome:** Retell a myth from a different culture (400-500 words) preserving key features of the genre including supernatural elements, a quest, and a moral

**Grammar focus:** multi-clause sentences with conjunctions (when, because, although), paragraphs to group related material, present perfect tense
*(from Y3 Appendix 2)*

**Literary terms:** myth, legend, hero, quest, supernatural, moral, archetype

---

## Suggested texts

- **Tales of Ancient Egypt** by Roger Lancelyn Green — Accessible retellings with strong narrative structure
- **The Orchard Book of Greek Myths** by Geraldine McCaughrean — Rich vocabulary with clear storytelling

---

## Genre

- **Narrative:** Extended prose fiction with characters, setting, and a plot driven by conflict and resolution. The dominant literary form across all key stages, progressing from simple retelling (KS1) through structured narrative (KS2) to literary fiction with controlled voice and style (KS3-KS4).
- **Traditional Tale:** Stories passed down through oral tradition with archetypal characters, repetitive structures, and moral lessons. The entry point to narrative for KS1 children because the familiar structures scaffold retelling and independent composition. Includes fairy tales, myths, legends, fables, and folk tales.

---

## Why this study matters

Myths from diverse cultures introduce Y3 to the wider world of traditional storytelling beyond European fairy tales. The common structures across cultures (hero's journey, origin explanations, moral teachings) develop pupils' ability to identify themes and conventions. The retelling task teaches narrative composition within a scaffolded framework — pupils know the story and can focus on language and style.

---

## Sequencing

**Leads to:** Adventure Narrative: The BFG

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. All myths treated as interchangeable rather than exploring how cultural context shapes the story
2. Retelling is flat plot summary without vivid language or dialogue
3. Supernatural elements treated superficially rather than exploring why myths use them

---

## Cross-curricular opportunities

| Link | Subject | Connection | Strength |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| Ancient Greece | History | Ancient civilisations — myths as windows into beliefs and values | Strong |
| Ancient Greek Pottery | Art and Design | Mythological illustration styles from different cultures | Strong |

## Reading and writing skills (KS2)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Word meaning from context** — Understand the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in simple texts by using the surrounding context, including pictures and sentence sense, to make a reasonable guess at what the word means.
- **Information retrieval from simple texts** — Find and report specific information or key facts from a short piece of fiction or non-fiction, identifying the part of the text where the answer is located.
- **Retelling and sequencing** — Retell the main events of a story or the key steps in a non-fiction text, placing them in the correct order and identifying the most important ideas.
- **Simple inference from text** — Use clues in the text — characters' words, actions and feelings — to work out something the author has not stated directly, and begin to explain the reasoning behind that interpretation.
- **Prediction from text clues** — Predict what is likely to happen next in a story or sequence of events, drawing on what has already been read and on prior knowledge of similar texts and situations.
- **Noticing interesting words and phrases** — Identify and discuss words and phrases that capture attention or create an effect, beginning to explain what makes them interesting, surprising or effective in the context of the text.

## Scaffolding and inclusion (Y3)

| Guideline | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Reading level | Developing Reader (Lexile 150–350) |
| Text-to-speech | Available |
| Max sentence length | 14 words |
| Vocabulary | Subject vocabulary with inline glossary support. Abstract concepts grounded in familiar contexts. Similes and comparisons helpful (e.g., 'solid is like a brick'). |
| Scaffolding level | Moderate To High |
| Hint tiers | 3 tiers |
| Session length | 12–20 minutes |
| Worked examples | Required — Text + diagram narrated. Step-by-step with child input at key points ('What would you do next?'). |
