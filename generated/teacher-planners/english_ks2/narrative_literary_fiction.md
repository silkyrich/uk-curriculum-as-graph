This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Narrative writing with authorial control (EN-Y6-C026)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

By Year 6, pupils produce narrative writing that demonstrates authorial control: deliberate choices of structure, viewpoint, vocabulary and grammatical form serve the intended effect on the reader. Mastery means pupils plan narratives with purposeful structure (not merely chronological sequence), create authentic settings and well-developed characters through showing rather than telling, integrate dialogue purposefully to advance plot and reveal character, and vary sentence structure and vocabulary choices consciously to create pace, tone and atmosphere.

**Teaching guidance:** Use shared writing to model the metacognitive dimension of narrative composition: think aloud about choices ('Should I use a long sentence here to create a sense of confusion, or a short sentence for impact?'). Provide regular opportunities for extended independent narrative writing preceded by structured planning. Develop pupils' awareness of viewpoint: first-person and third-person narrators each have distinctive possibilities and limitations. Teach the principle of 'show, don't tell' as a touchstone for descriptive writing. Use peer evaluation focused on specific craft elements (setting construction, dialogue punctuation, pacing) rather than general impression.

**Key vocabulary:** narrative, viewpoint, first person, third person, dialogue, setting, character, pacing, tone, atmosphere, structure, authorial choice

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often produce narratives that are chronological lists of events ('and then... and then...') rather than structured stories with purpose and shape. They may write long descriptions that pause the narrative without serving it. Dialogue is frequently punctuated incorrectly and written mechanically rather than used as a tool for revealing character or advancing the plot.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Writes a narrative with a clear beginning, middle and end, including a character, a setting and a sequence of events with some descriptive detail. | Write the opening two paragraphs of a story about a character who discovers something unexpected in a familiar place. Include description of the setting and introduce your character. | Rushes into the discovery without establishing the character or setting first; Describes the setting as a list of details rather than filtering it through the character's experience |
| **Developing** | Writes narratives that show awareness of pace, using description to slow down key moments and shorter sentences to speed up action, with some deliberate choices about viewpoint. | Write a scene where a character must make a difficult decision. Slow down the moment of decision using description and internal thought, then speed up the action when they commit to their choice. | Maintains the same pace throughout — either all slow description or all fast action; Tells the reader about the character's feelings ('she was terrified') rather than showing them through action and thought |
| **Expected** | Writes narratives demonstrating authorial control: deliberate choices about structure, viewpoint, pace, characterisation and setting, with awareness of the reader's experience. | Write a complete short story (approximately one page) in which the ending connects back to the opening in a meaningful way. Make deliberate choices about viewpoint and pace, and be prepared to explain them. | Writes a competent story but without deliberate structural or stylistic choices that can be articulated; Ends the story abruptly without connecting it back to the themes or images established at the beginning |
| **Greater Depth** | Makes sophisticated authorial choices — such as unreliable narration, non-linear structure, symbolic imagery or dual-timeline — and can explain how these techniques serve the story's meaning. | Write the opening of a story that uses a non-chronological structure (for example, starting at the end and then going back to explain how the character got there). Explain why this structure is more effective than starting at the beginning. | Uses non-chronological structure as a gimmick without it serving the story's meaning; Creates confusion rather than intrigue — the reader cannot follow what is happening |

> **Model response (Entry):** *Every morning, Kai took the same route through Highfield Woods to school. He knew every tree, every bend in the path, every patch of mud to avoid. It was boring. Nothing ever changed. But that Thursday, something did. Where the old oak had always stood, there was a door. Not a door in a wall or a building — just a door, standing on its own in the middle of the clearing, with a brass handle that glinted in the early light. Kai stopped. He looked behind it. Nothing. Just more woods. He looked at the handle.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *The boat was drifting further from the jetty. Inside it, her little brother clung to the seat, his knuckles white. The rope trailed in the water, just out of reach. Priya looked at the dark lake. She could not swim well — she had barely passed her ten-metre badge. The water looked cold and deep and nothing like a swimming pool. But Jaden was only five. He did not know what to do. She pulled off her shoes. She jumped. The cold hit her like a wall. She gasped, kicked, reached for the rope. Grabbed it. Held on.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *[A story with: First-person viewpoint establishing voice and personality. Opening image that establishes a motif (e.g. a locked music box). Rising action with a problem and complication. Pacing that slows at the emotional climax through description and internal thought. Resolution that returns to the opening image with new significance (the music box opens). Final line that echoes the opening sentence with a changed meaning.] Authorial choices: I used first person so the reader experiences the mystery directly. I slowed the pace at the climax — 'For a long time, I just sat there, turning the box over in my hands' — because the emotional moment matters more than the action. The ending mirrors the opening ('The music box had always been silent') but now the silence is a choice, not a mystery, which shows the character has changed.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *'I never meant to open the letter. That is what I told myself afterwards, standing in the headteacher's office with the torn envelope in my hand and the words still burning behind my eyes. But that is not entirely true. The truth started three weeks earlier, on the morning Grandad's desk arrived.' This opening works better than chronological order because it creates a mystery — the reader knows something went wrong with a letter but does not know what the letter said or why it matters. The flash-forward to the headteacher's office tells the reader there will be consequences, which creates tension throughout the chronological section. Starting at Grandad's desk arriving would be a slower opening with no hook. The phrase 'that is not entirely true' hints that the narrator might not be fully honest, which adds complexity — the reader has to judge for themselves what really happened.*

### Secondary concept: Advanced cohesive devices: repetition, grammatical connections and ellipsis (EN-Y6-C004)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

In Year 6, pupils extend their repertoire of cohesive devices to include: deliberate repetition of a key word or phrase for effect or emphasis; grammatical connections using adverbials such as 'on the other hand', 'in contrast', 'as a consequence'; and ellipsis (the deliberate omission of words that are understood from context). These are specifically identified as Year 6 text-level content in Appendix 2. At mastery, pupils deploy all three types purposefully to create well-structured, coherent texts that move beyond simple linking adverbials.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifies deliberate repetition in a short text and understands that repeating words or phrases on purpose can strengthen a message. | Identifies the repetition but says it is an accident or poor writing; Cannot suggest any purpose beyond 'to make it sound good' |
| **Developing** | Identifies repetition, cohesive adverbials and simple ellipsis in texts, and uses basic cohesive devices to link ideas in own writing. | Identifies 'nevertheless' as a connective but cannot explain its cohesive function (linking back to the previous idea); Does not recognise that 'He hadn't' is ellipsis because the omitted words seem obvious |
| **Expected** | Uses repetition, grammatical connections and ellipsis purposefully to create cohesion across paragraphs in extended writing, selecting the right device for the intended effect. | Uses a cohesive adverbial that does not logically fit ('Furthermore' when the next point is a contrast, not an addition); Attempts ellipsis but creates an ambiguous or incomplete sentence that the reader cannot reconstruct |
| **Greater Depth** | Analyses how published authors combine multiple cohesive devices for cumulative effect, evaluating which device is most effective in a given passage and why. | Analyses each device in isolation without discussing how they build on each other for cumulative effect; Identifies the devices correctly but evaluates in general terms ('it makes it more effective') without explaining the specific emotional journey they create |

### Secondary concept: Semi-colons, colons and dashes for independent clauses (EN-Y6-C006)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Semi-colons, colons and dashes can all mark boundaries between independent clauses (clauses that could each stand as a sentence), signalling different relationships. A colon introduces, explains or elaborates; a semi-colon balances or parallels two closely related clauses; a dash creates a more dramatic or informal effect. At Year 6 mastery, pupils deploy all three correctly and with awareness of their different effects. This is Year 6-specific punctuation content in Appendix 2.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recognises semi-colons, colons and dashes as distinct punctuation marks and names them correctly in example sentences. | Confuses semi-colon with colon, calling both 'colons'; Calls the dash 'a long hyphen' or 'a line' |
| **Developing** | Uses colons to introduce an explanation or elaboration and semi-colons to link two balanced, related independent clauses, with guided support. | Uses a semi-colon where a colon is needed (when the second clause explains the first); Puts a capital letter after the semi-colon or colon |
| **Expected** | Deploys semi-colons, colons and dashes correctly in independent writing, understanding and articulating the different relationship each mark signals between clauses. | Uses all three marks identically without differentiating the relationship they signal; Creates a dependent clause after the colon rather than an independent clause ('The experiment failed: because the chemicals were contaminated') |
| **Greater Depth** | Analyses an author's choice of punctuation between clauses in published writing, evaluating how the choice affects tone, pace and reader interpretation. | Says the dash 'sounds more dramatic' without explaining what the reader experiences differently; Analyses the content of the clauses but not the specific contribution of the punctuation choice |

### Secondary concept: Critical evaluation of authorial language and structure (EN-Y6-C012)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

At Year 6, language analysis extends to evaluation: not just identifying what a writer does but critically evaluating whether it is effective, for whom and why. Pupils consider how language, structure and presentation contribute to meaning in texts of increasing complexity, applying technical vocabulary including metaphor, simile, analogy, imagery, style and effect. Mastery means pupils can construct a sustained analytical argument about a text's language and structure, supported by specific textual evidence.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifies a named language or structural technique in a short extract when directed to look for it, and describes what it does in simple terms. | Identifies the technique but cannot explain what it does beyond 'it makes it interesting'; Describes only the content of the sentences rather than the effect of their structure |
| **Developing** | Identifies multiple language and structural choices in an extract and describes their effect on the reader, beginning to use the identify-describe pattern with some technical vocabulary. | Identifies techniques but describes effects vaguely ('it makes the reader feel something'); Treats 'identify' and 'describe' as the same step rather than separating what the technique is from what it does |
| **Expected** | Constructs a three-move analytical response (identify, describe, evaluate) that critically assesses why the author chose specific language and structural techniques and how effectively they achieve their purpose. | Identifies and describes but stops short of evaluating whether the techniques are effective and why; Analyses each technique in isolation without discussing how they work together to create a cumulative effect |
| **Greater Depth** | Critically evaluates authorial choices by considering whether techniques are original or conventional, how different readers might respond, and whether the language and structure serve the text's wider purpose. Constructs a sustained analytical argument rather than a list of observations. | Declares one approach universally 'better' without considering audience or purpose; Evaluates only the language choices without considering how structure contributes independently to meaning |

### Secondary concept: Writing with conscious grammatical control (EN-Y6-C013)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

The curriculum's overarching Year 6 writing aspiration is that pupils can 'consciously control sentence structure in their writing and understand why sentences are constructed as they are'. This metacognitive dimension — knowing not just how to write a sentence but why a particular construction achieves a particular effect — represents the highest expectation of the primary programme and directly prepares pupils for GCSE. Mastery means pupils can justify their grammatical choices in terms of effect, audience and purpose.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recognises that writers make choices about sentence structure and can identify different structures (simple, compound, complex) in a given text. | Identifies sentence length rather than structure — assumes long sentences are complex and short ones are simple; Cannot name or distinguish clause types, calling everything 'a sentence' |
| **Developing** | Writes using a deliberate range of sentence structures and, with prompting, can explain why a particular structure suits the moment in the writing. | Writes sentences of varied length but does not vary the grammatical structure itself; Annotates with vague comments like 'it sounds good' rather than explaining the structural effect |
| **Expected** | Consciously controls sentence structure throughout a sustained piece of writing, varying it for effect and able to articulate why specific constructions serve the writer's purpose at each point. | Makes structural changes but cannot explain the intended effect on the reader; Varies structure mechanically (short-long-short-long) without connecting choices to meaning or pace |
| **Greater Depth** | Analyses how published authors control sentence structure for specific effects, then transfers those principles to own writing with metacognitive awareness of technique. | Copies the author's surface features (e.g. short sentences) without understanding the structural principle behind the effect; Analyses the published text well but cannot transfer the techniques to a different context |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Planning and structuring extended writing around audience and purpose is the organising principle of Y6 composition — every structural decision (opening, development, conclusion, evidence placement) is judged against whether it serves the writer's purpose for the specified audience.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- How does the shape or arrangement help it do its job?
- Can you find two different structures that do the same thing? How do they compare?
- If you were designing this, what would you keep and what would you change?
- Why is this material or structure better suited than another?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Using evidence and quotation to support writing is the written form of the argument structure — pupils embed textual evidence within their own prose to demonstrate and substantiate claims, which is the foundational skill for analytical writing at secondary level.

---

## Session structure: Text Study

### Text Study
A reading-to-writing cycle for primary and KS3 English. Begins with shared or guided reading of a high-quality text, moves through analysis of language features and authorial choices, builds vocabulary, then scaffolds the writing process from planning through drafting to editing and publication.

`shared_reading` → `analysis` → `vocabulary` → `planning` → `drafting` → `editing`

**Assessment:** Final written outcome in the genre studied, demonstrating understanding of text features, appropriate vocabulary use, and effective application of the writing process.

**Teacher note:** Use the TEXT STUDY template: share a quality text and guide pupils to analyse the author's choices — vocabulary, sentence structure, and literary techniques. Build subject-specific vocabulary through discussion. Support pupils in planning and drafting their own writing, applying techniques they have identified. Include time for editing and improving their work.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What effect does the author create with this word or phrase?
- Why did the author structure the text this way?
- What technique could you borrow for your own writing?
- How could you improve this section of your draft?

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Fiction
**Features to teach:** controlled narrative voice (first or third person with distinct perspective), setting as atmosphere (pathetic fallacy, symbolic setting), dialogue revealing character and advancing plot, structural choices for effect (non-linear chronology, multiple perspectives)

**Writing outcome:** Write a literary narrative (700-1000 words) with controlled voice, atmospheric setting, and sophisticated structural choices, demonstrating conscious grammatical control throughout

**Grammar focus:** semi-colons and colons for independent clauses, active and passive voice for effect, formal vocabulary choices, advanced cohesive devices (ellipsis, repetition)
*(from Y6 Appendix 2)*

**Literary terms:** narrative voice, pathetic fallacy, dramatic irony, symbolism, foreshadowing, ellipsis, motif

---

## Suggested texts

- **Skellig** by David Almond — Literary fiction with controlled voice, atmospheric setting, and thematic depth
- **The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas** by John Boyne — First-person naive narrator with dramatic irony — strong model for voice

---

## Genre

- **Narrative:** Extended prose fiction with characters, setting, and a plot driven by conflict and resolution. The dominant literary form across all key stages, progressing from simple retelling (KS1) through structured narrative (KS2) to literary fiction with controlled voice and style (KS3-KS4).
- **Literary Fiction:** Prose fiction studied analytically for its literary qualities rather than simply read for plot. The progression from KS2 narrative: at KS3-KS4, fiction becomes an object of critical study where students analyse how authors construct meaning through language, structure, and form. Includes both reading (textual analysis) and writing (creative composition).

---

## Why this study matters

Y6 narrative is the culmination of primary English writing. Pupils must demonstrate 'conscious grammatical control' (NC) and the ability to select vocabulary and grammar to 'change and enhance meaning.' This unit bridges to KS3 by introducing literary fiction concepts (narrative voice, symbolism, structural choices) that will be central to secondary English study. The longer piece (700-1000 words) develops writing stamina needed for KS3.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Narrative voice is inconsistent — slipping between first and third person or between formal and informal
2. Advanced punctuation (semi-colons, colons) used incorrectly or forced into the writing
3. Structural choices (flashback, multiple perspectives) attempted but executed confusingly

---

## Reading and writing skills (KS2)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Word meaning from context** — Understand the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in simple texts by using the surrounding context, including pictures and sentence sense, to make a reasonable guess at what the word means.
- **Information retrieval from simple texts** — Find and report specific information or key facts from a short piece of fiction or non-fiction, identifying the part of the text where the answer is located.
- **Retelling and sequencing** — Retell the main events of a story or the key steps in a non-fiction text, placing them in the correct order and identifying the most important ideas.
- **Simple inference from text** — Use clues in the text — characters' words, actions and feelings — to work out something the author has not stated directly, and begin to explain the reasoning behind that interpretation.
- **Prediction from text clues** — Predict what is likely to happen next in a story or sequence of events, drawing on what has already been read and on prior knowledge of similar texts and situations.
- **Noticing interesting words and phrases** — Identify and discuss words and phrases that capture attention or create an effect, beginning to explain what makes them interesting, surprising or effective in the context of the text.
