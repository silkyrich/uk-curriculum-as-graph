## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **6 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Active listening and appropriate response (EN-Y4-C001)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Pupils listen and respond appropriately to adults and their peers in Year 4, demonstrating sustained and attentive listening across formal and informal contexts with increasing independence

**Teaching guidance:** Build on Year 3 listening by requiring children to listen to more extended and complex speech — longer teacher explanations, class debates and oral presentations by peers. Teach children to listen for the main point and supporting details, and to respond by summarising what they heard before adding their own contribution. Use the response frame: 'What I heard you say was... and I would add...' Practise listening to audio recordings and news reports as well as live speech.

**Key vocabulary:** active listening, respond, summarise, main point, detail, appropriate, contribution, follow up, paraphrase

**Common misconceptions:** Children may appear attentive but only process the last thing said, missing the overall argument or explanation. They may respond to what they want to talk about rather than what was actually said. Some children interrupt rather than waiting for the speaker to finish because they fear forgetting their point.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Listening to short spoken instructions or explanations and responding with a simple relevant comment or action. | Listen to the teacher read a short paragraph about hedgehogs. Tell your partner one fact you heard. | Repeating the last sentence only rather than identifying a key fact; Responding with an unrelated personal anecdote about a pet |
| **Developing** | Listening to extended speech and responding by summarising the main point before adding a relevant contribution. | Listen to your partner explain why they think the wolf is the villain in the story. Summarise what they said, then add your own view. | Skipping the summary and jumping straight to own opinion; Summarising inaccurately by changing the speaker's meaning |
| **Expected** | Sustaining attentive listening across formal and informal contexts, identifying main points and supporting details, and responding with relevant questions or comments that build on what was said. | Listen to a classmate's two-minute presentation about the water cycle. Ask one question about something they explained and one about something they did not cover. | Asking a question already answered in the presentation; Asking only factual recall questions rather than extending understanding |
| **Greater Depth** | Listening critically to identify strengths and gaps in an argument, and responding by evaluating what was said rather than simply adding information. | Listen to two classmates debate whether zoos are good for animals. Identify the strongest argument from each side and explain which you found more convincing and why. | Choosing the argument they personally agree with rather than evaluating the reasoning; Failing to identify specific arguments, giving a vague response |

> **Model response (Entry):** *Hedgehogs curl into a ball to protect themselves.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *You said the wolf is the villain because he tricks the grandmother. I agree, but I also think he is clever because he plans everything carefully.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *You explained evaporation really clearly. My question is: does the water cycle happen faster in hot countries? Also, you didn't mention what happens to water underground — does that count as part of the cycle?*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *Priya's strongest point was that zoos protect endangered species from extinction. Mo's strongest point was that animals in zoos cannot behave naturally. I found Mo more convincing because he gave specific examples of animals pacing in small enclosures.*

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Planning from model texts involves understanding how the model's structure serves its purpose — pupils analyse what the text does and why before designing their own version with an equivalent structure.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- How does the shape or arrangement help it do its job?
- Can you find two different structures that do the same thing? How do they compare?
- If you were designing this, what would you keep and what would you change?
- Why is this material or structure better suited than another?

**Secondary lens:** Perspective and Interpretation — Reading aloud own writing and evaluating it requires adopting the perspective of the intended audience, asking whether the effect intended by the writer is the effect experienced by the reader.

## Session structure: Discussion and Debate

### Discussion and Debate
A structured sequence for exploring contested issues or multiple perspectives. Begins with a stimulus that raises a question or dilemma, builds knowledge through research, develops arguments through structured discussion techniques, captures thinking in writing, and reflects on how views may have changed.

`stimulus` → `research` → `structured_discussion` → `writing` → `reflection`

**Assessment:** Balanced written argument or persuasive piece demonstrating understanding of multiple perspectives, supported by evidence, with a reasoned personal conclusion.

**Teacher note:** Use the DISCUSSION AND DEBATE template: present a clear stimulus such as a statement, image, or short text that prompts different viewpoints. Give pupils time to research or gather evidence for their position. Use a structured discussion format with clear rules for listening and responding. Guide them to write up their view with reasons and evidence.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What do you think about this? Why?
- Can you give a reason for your opinion?
- What might someone who disagrees say?
- Can you write down your view with your best reason?

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Non Fiction
**Features to teach:** for and against structure, connectives for contrast, conclusion with justified opinion, formal register

**Writing outcome:** Write a balanced discussion text (400-600 words) presenting both sides of the argument with a justified conclusion

**Grammar focus:** conjunctions, adverbs and prepositions for time and cause, paragraphs to organise ideas around a theme, multi-clause sentences
*(from Y4 Appendix 2)*

**Literary terms:** argument, counter-argument, connective, register, rhetorical question

---

## Suggested texts

- **Should There Be Zoos?** by Tony Stead — Balanced discussion text modelling the for/against structure
- **Newspaper debate articles (adapted)** by Various — Age-appropriate debate articles for analysis

---

## Genre

- **Discussion:** Texts that present multiple viewpoints on a debatable issue, reaching a justified conclusion. More demanding than persuasion because pupils must hold two opposing positions in mind simultaneously and treat both fairly. Often paired with spoken language (debate) to develop oracy alongside writing.

---

## Why this study matters

Structured debate develops both oracy and writing simultaneously, which the NC requires at Y4. The zoo question provides a genuine moral dilemma with accessible arguments on both sides, making it easier for pupils to construct balanced arguments. Moving from spoken discussion to written balanced argument teaches pupils that writing captures and refines oral reasoning.

## Sequencing

**Follows:** Persuasive Writing: Save Our Park

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Discussion dominated by a few confident speakers while quieter pupils disengage
2. Written arguments present personal opinion as the only valid position rather than genuinely balancing both sides
3. Connectives for contrast (however, on the other hand) used mechanically as sentence starters without genuine argumentative purpose

## Reading and writing skills (KS2)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Word meaning from context** — Understand the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in simple texts by using the surrounding context, including pictures and sentence sense, to make a reasonable guess at what the word means.
- **Information retrieval from simple texts** — Find and report specific information or key facts from a short piece of fiction or non-fiction, identifying the part of the text where the answer is located.
- **Retelling and sequencing** — Retell the main events of a story or the key steps in a non-fiction text, placing them in the correct order and identifying the most important ideas.
- **Simple inference from text** — Use clues in the text — characters' words, actions and feelings — to work out something the author has not stated directly, and begin to explain the reasoning behind that interpretation.
- **Prediction from text clues** — Predict what is likely to happen next in a story or sequence of events, drawing on what has already been read and on prior knowledge of similar texts and situations.
- **Noticing interesting words and phrases** — Identify and discuss words and phrases that capture attention or create an effect, beginning to explain what makes them interesting, surprising or effective in the context of the text.

## Scaffolding and inclusion (Y4)

| Guideline | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Reading level | Fluent Reader (Emerging) (Lexile 300–500) |
| Text-to-speech | Available |
| Max sentence length | 18 words |
| Vocabulary | Curriculum vocabulary expected to be known (with in-context reminder). Some academic vocabulary (e.g., 'evidence', 'conclusion') acceptable. Technical terms in context. |
| Scaffolding level | Moderate |
| Hint tiers | 3 tiers |
| Session length | 15–25 minutes |
| Worked examples | Required — Text-based with inline questions. Not fully narrated — child reads the example. |
| Feedback tone | Respectful And Precise |
| Normalize struggle | Yes |
| Example correct feedback | *Your inference was correct — the text never said the character was nervous, but you worked it out from the clues: the short sentences and the word 'paced'. That is sophisticated reading.* |
| Example error feedback | *This is a common misconception: plants do not get their food from the soil — they make it from sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. The soil provides minerals, but food is made in the leaves.* |
