## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **5 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Non-narrative writing: explanation, report, persuasion and discussion (EN-Y6-C025)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

By Year 6, pupils can plan and produce effective non-narrative texts in a range of forms — explanation, report, persuasion and discussion — with appropriate structure, vocabulary, register and text organisation for each form. Mastery means pupils understand the distinctive conventions of each non-narrative form (e.g., impersonal third-person for reports, direct address for persuasion, balanced argument for discussion) and deploy them purposefully, using evidence, examples and organisational devices to produce coherent, well-structured non-fiction.

**Teaching guidance:** Ensure pupils have studied high-quality examples of each form before writing in that form. Use analysis of model texts to identify the structural and language conventions: 'In this explanation text, every paragraph begins with... and the passive voice is used because...'. Teach text types as a repertoire with shared features (all non-fiction needs clear structure and appropriate vocabulary) and distinctive features (each form serves a specific purpose). Require pupils to plan the structure, audience and purpose before drafting, and to evaluate their writing against these criteria after.

**Key vocabulary:** explanation, report, persuasion, discussion, argument, evidence, structure, register, impersonal, audience, purpose, organise

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils frequently confuse explanation and report (both deal with factual content but for different purposes: explanation answers 'how/why', report answers 'what/when/where'). They may use narrative conventions in non-fiction (past tense, personal pronouns) where the form requires impersonal, present tense writing. Persuasion and discussion are also confused: persuasion advocates a single position; discussion considers multiple viewpoints.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifies different non-narrative text types (explanation, report, persuasion, discussion) and names their basic features when shown clear examples. | Match each text extract to its type: explanation, report, persuasion or discussion. Explain one feature that helped you decide for each. | Confuses explanation with report because both contain factual information; Identifies text type correctly but cannot name the feature that signals it |
| **Developing** | Plans and writes a non-narrative text in one form using a model, including the key structural features and appropriate language, though may not yet sustain register or structure throughout. | Using the model explanation text as a guide, write an explanation of how a volcano erupts. Include a title, an introduction, a step-by-step causal chain, and a concluding statement. | Writes an information report about volcanoes rather than an explanation of the process; Includes causal steps but not in a clear logical sequence |
| **Expected** | Plans and produces effective non-narrative texts in multiple forms, selecting structure, language and organisational devices appropriate to the form, purpose and audience, sustaining register and coherence throughout. | Your class has been studying the question: 'Should plastic bags be banned?' Write a balanced discussion text of about 300 words. Include an introduction that frames the debate, at least two arguments on each side with evidence, and a conclusion that weighs the arguments. | Presents arguments for one side more convincingly than the other, creating a biased discussion; Writes a conclusion that introduces new arguments rather than weighing those already presented |
| **Greater Depth** | Writes non-narrative texts that demonstrate authorial control — selecting the most effective form for a given purpose, adapting structure for impact, and deploying rhetorical and organisational techniques with precision and confidence. | You want to convince your head teacher to create a school garden. Choose the most effective form (letter, report, speech or article) and write it. In a separate paragraph, explain why you chose that form over the others and identify three specific techniques you used to make your writing persuasive. | Chooses a form without being able to explain why it is more effective than the alternatives; Identifies techniques after writing but the techniques are not clearly present in the actual text |

> **Model response (Entry):** *Extract 1 = explanation — it uses 'This happens because...' to show a cause-and-effect chain. Extract 2 = report — it uses subheadings and presents factual information in a neutral tone. Extract 3 = persuasion — it uses 'You should...' and emotional language to convince the reader. Extract 4 = discussion — it presents arguments 'for' and 'against' before reaching a conclusion.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Title: How Does a Volcano Erupt? Introduction: Volcanoes are openings in the Earth's surface where molten rock escapes. But what causes an eruption? Causal chain: Deep beneath the surface, extreme heat melts rock into magma. This magma is less dense than the surrounding rock, so it rises slowly through cracks. As it rises, the pressure above it decreases, allowing dissolved gases to expand. Eventually, the pressure becomes too great and the magma bursts through the surface as lava, ash and gas. Conclusion: Volcanic eruptions are caused by a chain of events driven by heat and pressure deep underground.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *The debate over whether plastic bags should be banned has intensified in recent years as concerns about environmental damage have grown. This discussion examines arguments on both sides before reaching a conclusion. Those in favour of a ban argue that plastic bags cause severe harm to wildlife and ecosystems. According to the Marine Conservation Society, over 8 million tonnes of plastic enter the oceans each year, and bags are among the most commonly found items on beaches. A ban would immediately reduce this pollution. Furthermore, alternatives such as reusable bags are widely available and affordable. Opponents argue that a complete ban could disadvantage poorer families who rely on free carrier bags for multiple uses, including bin liners and packed lunches. They also point out that manufacturing cotton tote bags uses significantly more energy than producing plastic ones, meaning the environmental benefit is not straightforward. Some suggest that a charge, rather than a ban, strikes a better balance. In conclusion, while both sides raise valid points, the evidence of environmental damage is compelling. A phased ban, combined with affordable alternatives and clear public information, would reduce harm without placing an unfair burden on those who can least afford it.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *[Formal letter to the head teacher, approximately 250 words, including: a clear statement of purpose, three organised arguments with supporting evidence (health benefits, curriculum links, community engagement), acknowledgement and rebuttal of a potential objection (cost), and a polite but assertive closing request.] Explanation: I chose a formal letter because it is a direct, personal appeal to one decision-maker, which is more appropriate than a general article or public speech. A report would present information neutrally, but I needed to persuade, not just inform. Three techniques: (1) I used the tricolon 'healthier, happier and more engaged' for rhetorical impact. (2) I anticipated the objection about cost and countered it with evidence that local businesses have offered donations, which shows I have considered practicalities. (3) I closed with 'I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this further,' which is firm but respectful — it assumes the conversation will continue rather than asking 'please can we?'*

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Planning and structuring extended writing around audience and purpose is the organising principle of Y6 composition — every structural decision (opening, development, conclusion, evidence placement) is judged against whether it serves the writer's purpose for the specified audience.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- How does the shape or arrangement help it do its job?
- Can you find two different structures that do the same thing? How do they compare?
- If you were designing this, what would you keep and what would you change?
- Why is this material or structure better suited than another?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Using evidence and quotation to support writing is the written form of the argument structure — pupils embed textual evidence within their own prose to demonstrate and substantiate claims, which is the foundational skill for analytical writing at secondary level.

## Session structure: Discussion and Debate + Writer's Workshop

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Discussion and Debate (main structure)
A structured sequence for exploring contested issues or multiple perspectives. Begins with a stimulus that raises a question or dilemma, builds knowledge through research, develops arguments through structured discussion techniques, captures thinking in writing, and reflects on how views may have changed.

`stimulus` → `research` → `structured_discussion` → `writing` → `reflection`

**Assessment:** Balanced written argument or persuasive piece demonstrating understanding of multiple perspectives, supported by evidence, with a reasoned personal conclusion.

**Teacher note:** Use the DISCUSSION AND DEBATE template: present a clear stimulus such as a statement, image, or short text that prompts different viewpoints. Give pupils time to research or gather evidence for their position. Use a structured discussion format with clear rules for listening and responding. Guide them to write up their view with reasons and evidence.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What do you think about this? Why?
- Can you give a reason for your opinion?
- What might someone who disagrees say?
- Can you write down your view with your best reason?

### Writer's Workshop
A process-writing sequence that develops pupils as independent writers. Studies a mentor text to identify craft techniques, practises those techniques in isolation, plans an original piece, drafts with attention to audience and purpose, engages in peer review for feedback, revises and edits, and publishes the final piece.

`mentor_text` → `technique_identification` → `planning` → `drafting` → `peer_review` → `editing` → `publication`

**Assessment:** Final published piece demonstrating identified craft techniques, with writing portfolio showing development through the drafting and revision process.

**Teacher note:** Use the WRITER'S WORKSHOP template: share a mentor text and guide pupils to identify specific techniques the writer uses. Model how to plan writing that uses those techniques purposefully. Give pupils time to draft their own piece, then facilitate peer review focused on the targeted technique. Guide editing with attention to grammar, punctuation, and the effect of their choices on the reader.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What techniques does the mentor text use, and what effect do they create?
- How have you planned to use this technique in your own writing?
- What feedback did your partner give, and how will you respond to it?
- What edits will improve the clarity and impact of your writing?

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Non Fiction
**Features to teach:** formal academic register throughout, passive voice for objectivity, subjunctive mood (if I were, were he to), cohesive devices across an extended piece, counter-argument with nuanced rebuttal

**Writing outcome:** Write a formal persuasive or discursive essay (600-800 words) with controlled register, passive voice, subjunctive forms, and evidence-based argumentation

**Grammar focus:** passive voice for formality, subjunctive forms, formal vocabulary and structures, semi-colons within lists, colons to introduce lists
*(from Y6 Appendix 2)*

**Literary terms:** register, passive voice, subjunctive, rhetorical device, formal tone

## Suggested texts

- **Model formal essays (teacher-curated)** by Various — Exemplars demonstrating formal register, passive voice, and subjunctive
- **First News editorials and opinion pieces** by Various — Real-world examples of formal persuasive writing for children

---

## Genre

- **Persuasion:** Texts that argue a single point of view using rhetorical and emotional techniques to convince the reader. Distinct from discussion (which is balanced): persuasion is deliberately one-sided. Teaches pupils to identify and deploy techniques including rhetorical questions, emotive language, repetition, and direct address.
- **Discussion:** Texts that present multiple viewpoints on a debatable issue, reaching a justified conclusion. More demanding than persuasion because pupils must hold two opposing positions in mind simultaneously and treat both fairly. Often paired with spoken language (debate) to develop oracy alongside writing.

## Why this study matters

Y6 formal writing is the direct bridge to KS3 academic writing. The NC requires subjunctive forms and passive voice to be taught at Y6, and both are best introduced in the context of formal essay writing where they serve a genuine purpose (objectivity, formality). This unit ensures pupils arrive at secondary school able to write in a controlled formal register — a skill many KS3 teachers identify as the biggest gap.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Passive voice and subjunctive inserted artificially rather than used where the register demands them
2. Formal register collapses into informal language in the middle of the piece
3. Arguments are opinions dressed up in formal language rather than genuine evidence-based reasoning

---

## Reading and writing skills (KS2)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Word meaning from context** — Understand the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in simple texts by using the surrounding context, including pictures and sentence sense, to make a reasonable guess at what the word means.
- **Information retrieval from simple texts** — Find and report specific information or key facts from a short piece of fiction or non-fiction, identifying the part of the text where the answer is located.
- **Retelling and sequencing** — Retell the main events of a story or the key steps in a non-fiction text, placing them in the correct order and identifying the most important ideas.
- **Simple inference from text** — Use clues in the text — characters' words, actions and feelings — to work out something the author has not stated directly, and begin to explain the reasoning behind that interpretation.
- **Prediction from text clues** — Predict what is likely to happen next in a story or sequence of events, drawing on what has already been read and on prior knowledge of similar texts and situations.
- **Noticing interesting words and phrases** — Identify and discuss words and phrases that capture attention or create an effect, beginning to explain what makes them interesting, surprising or effective in the context of the text.
