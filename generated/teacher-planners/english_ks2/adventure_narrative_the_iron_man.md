## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **5 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Wide reading for positive attitudes (EN-Y4-C016)

**Type:** Attitude | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Pupils develop positive attitudes to reading through listening to and discussing a wide range of fiction, poetry, plays, non-fiction, reference books and textbooks, including books and authors they would not choose themselves

**Teaching guidance:** Foster positive attitudes to reading by ensuring access to a wide range of engaging texts, including books chosen by children, texts recommended by peers and adults, and texts representing diverse voices and experiences. Maintain daily independent reading time with teacher conferencing. Create a reading community through book clubs, author visits, library visits and reading challenges. Model your own reading habits: share what you are reading and why. Avoid linking reading to extrinsic rewards (stickers, prizes) that can undermine intrinsic motivation.

**Key vocabulary:** reading for pleasure, attitude, enjoy, choice, recommend, wide reading, author, genre, motivation, engage

**Common misconceptions:** Children may equate reading ability with reading enjoyment, and those who find reading difficult may develop negative attitudes. Some children read only one genre or author and resist exploring new territory. Others may report enjoying reading but not actually read independently, suggesting their attitudes have not translated into habits.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Choosing a book to read independently and explaining why they chose it. | Choose a book from the class library. Tell your partner why you picked it. | Choosing a book that is far too easy or too hard; Unable to give any reason for the choice |
| **Developing** | Reading a range of texts including books they would not normally choose, and talking about what they enjoyed or found interesting. | This week you read a poetry book chosen by your teacher. Write two sentences about what you thought of it — even if it wasn't your usual choice. | Dismissing unfamiliar genres without genuine engagement; Only commenting on whether they 'liked' it without saying anything specific |
| **Expected** | Reading widely across fiction, poetry, plays, non-fiction and reference texts, discussing preferences and making recommendations to others. | Write a book recommendation for the class display. Include what the book is about, who would enjoy it, and what makes it special. | Writing a plot summary without evaluation; Recommending only to people who like the same genres they do |
| **Greater Depth** | Reflecting on how reading habits and preferences have developed over time, and seeking out unfamiliar authors and genres independently. | Write a reading reflection: How have your reading tastes changed since Year 2? What book changed your mind about a genre? | Listing books read without reflecting on how tastes have changed; Claiming to enjoy everything without genuine self-awareness about preferences |

> **Model response (Entry):** *I chose this book because I like the cover — it has a dragon on it and I like fantasy stories. Also, my friend said it was really good.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *I don't usually choose poetry, but I liked the poem about the storm because the words made me feel like I was actually there. Some poems were confusing, but I liked the funny ones about school.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *I recommend 'The Wild Robot' by Peter Brown. It is about a robot called Roz who wakes up on an island and has to learn to survive in the wild. I would recommend it to anyone who likes nature and adventure. What makes it special is that it makes you think about what it means to belong — even if you are different from everyone around you.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *In Year 2, I only read funny books like Tom Gates. I didn't think I liked serious stories. Then in Year 3, my teacher read us 'The Boy at the Back of the Class' and I cried at the end. That changed my mind about realistic fiction because I realised stories about real problems can be just as gripping as funny ones. Now I choose a mix — I still love comedy but I also read historical fiction and even some poetry.*

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Planning from model texts involves understanding how the model's structure serves its purpose — pupils analyse what the text does and why before designing their own version with an equivalent structure.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- How does the shape or arrangement help it do its job?
- Can you find two different structures that do the same thing? How do they compare?
- If you were designing this, what would you keep and what would you change?
- Why is this material or structure better suited than another?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Evaluating writing requires using the text itself as evidence — pupils assess whether the words on the page achieve the intended effect, then edit based on that judgement with criteria as the argumentative standard.

## Session structure: Text Study

### Text Study
A reading-to-writing cycle for primary and KS3 English. Begins with shared or guided reading of a high-quality text, moves through analysis of language features and authorial choices, builds vocabulary, then scaffolds the writing process from planning through drafting to editing and publication.

`shared_reading` → `analysis` → `vocabulary` → `planning` → `drafting` → `editing`

**Assessment:** Final written outcome in the genre studied, demonstrating understanding of text features, appropriate vocabulary use, and effective application of the writing process.

**Teacher note:** Use the TEXT STUDY template: share a quality text and guide pupils to analyse the author's choices — vocabulary, sentence structure, and literary techniques. Build subject-specific vocabulary through discussion. Support pupils in planning and drafting their own writing, applying techniques they have identified. Include time for editing and improving their work.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What effect does the author create with this word or phrase?
- Why did the author structure the text this way?
- What technique could you borrow for your own writing?
- How could you improve this section of your draft?

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Fiction
**Features to teach:** problem-resolution structure, vivid description using expanded noun phrases, dialogue to advance plot, building suspense through sentence variation

**Writing outcome:** Write an adventure narrative (500-700 words) with clear problem-resolution structure, vivid description using expanded noun phrases, and dialogue punctuated with inverted commas

**Grammar focus:** fronted adverbials, expanded noun phrases, direct speech punctuation
*(from Y4 Appendix 2)*

**Literary terms:** protagonist, antagonist, climax, resolution, suspense, imagery, personification

---

## Suggested texts

- **The Iron Man** by Ted Hughes — Clear three-act structure, rich vocabulary, accessible themes of fear and friendship
- **Stig of the Dump** by Clive King — Alternative anchor text with adventure and historical elements

---

## Genre

- **Narrative:** Extended prose fiction with characters, setting, and a plot driven by conflict and resolution. The dominant literary form across all key stages, progressing from simple retelling (KS1) through structured narrative (KS2) to literary fiction with controlled voice and style (KS3-KS4).

---

## Why this study matters

Ted Hughes' The Iron Man provides a rich model for adventure narrative writing with its clear problem-resolution structure, vivid descriptive language, and dialogue that advances the plot. The text's accessible yet ambitious vocabulary and structural clarity make it an ideal mentor text for Y4 pupils learning to sustain narrative writing across multiple paragraphs with fronted adverbials and expanded noun phrases.

---

## Sequencing

**Leads to:** Fairy Tales: Rewriting the Classics

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pupils retell The Iron Man rather than writing their own adventure narrative using its structural features
2. Dialogue added decoratively rather than used to advance the plot or reveal character
3. Fronted adverbials used repetitively without varying sentence openings

## Reading and writing skills (KS2)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Word meaning from context** — Understand the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in simple texts by using the surrounding context, including pictures and sentence sense, to make a reasonable guess at what the word means.
- **Information retrieval from simple texts** — Find and report specific information or key facts from a short piece of fiction or non-fiction, identifying the part of the text where the answer is located.
- **Retelling and sequencing** — Retell the main events of a story or the key steps in a non-fiction text, placing them in the correct order and identifying the most important ideas.
- **Simple inference from text** — Use clues in the text — characters' words, actions and feelings — to work out something the author has not stated directly, and begin to explain the reasoning behind that interpretation.
- **Prediction from text clues** — Predict what is likely to happen next in a story or sequence of events, drawing on what has already been read and on prior knowledge of similar texts and situations.
- **Noticing interesting words and phrases** — Identify and discuss words and phrases that capture attention or create an effect, beginning to explain what makes them interesting, surprising or effective in the context of the text.

## Scaffolding and inclusion (Y4)

| Guideline | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Reading level | Fluent Reader (Emerging) (Lexile 300–500) |
| Text-to-speech | Available |
| Max sentence length | 18 words |
| Vocabulary | Curriculum vocabulary expected to be known (with in-context reminder). Some academic vocabulary (e.g., 'evidence', 'conclusion') acceptable. Technical terms in context. |
| Scaffolding level | Moderate |
| Hint tiers | 3 tiers |
| Session length | 15–25 minutes |
| Worked examples | Required — Text-based with inline questions. Not fully narrated — child reads the example. |
| Feedback tone | Respectful And Precise |
| Normalize struggle | Yes |
| Example correct feedback | *Your inference was correct — the text never said the character was nervous, but you worked it out from the clues: the short sentences and the word 'paced'. That is sophisticated reading.* |
| Example error feedback | *This is a common misconception: plants do not get their food from the soil — they make it from sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. The soil provides minerals, but food is made in the leaves.* |
