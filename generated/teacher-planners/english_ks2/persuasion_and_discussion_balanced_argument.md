## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Audience, purpose and form in writing (EN-Y5-C026)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

At upper KS2, pupils plan writing by explicitly identifying the intended audience, the purpose of the writing and the most appropriate form to achieve that purpose, selecting from a range of text types used as models. Mastery means pupils make conscious choices about form and language that reflect genuine awareness of audience and purpose, not simply genre conventions applied mechanically.

**Teaching guidance:** Before all extended writing tasks, require pupils to articulate audience and purpose explicitly: Who is this for? What is it trying to do? What form is most appropriate? Provide model texts for each form studied. Return to audience and purpose when evaluating and editing — 'Does this achieve its purpose for its audience?'

**Key vocabulary:** audience, purpose, form, genre, register, style, model text, context

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often treat 'audience' as a mechanical box to tick rather than a genuine influence on their writing choices. They may choose form based on what they find easiest rather than what is most effective for the purpose.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying who a piece of writing is for and what it is trying to do when given clear examples. | Look at these two texts: a letter to a friend and a letter to the headteacher. Who is the audience for each? What is the purpose of each? | Describing what the text says rather than who it is for and what it is trying to do; Not understanding that audience and purpose affect the language choices |
| **Developing** | Identifying audience, purpose and form before writing, and making some deliberate language choices that reflect this awareness. | You need to write about why your school should get a new playground. Your teacher gives you two options: a persuasive letter to the local council, or a poster for the school noticeboard. Which form would you choose and why? How would the language differ? | Choosing a form without explaining why it suits the purpose; Using the same register regardless of audience |
| **Expected** | Consistently identifying audience, purpose and form before writing, selecting appropriate forms using other writing as models, and making conscious language and structural choices throughout the writing process. | Write the opening paragraph of a newspaper report about a local event AND the opening of a diary entry about the same event. Explain how audience and purpose changed your choices. | Writing in the correct form but not varying the language to reflect the different audiences; Treating audience as a box to tick rather than a genuine influence on every language choice |
| **Greater Depth** | Adapting writing flexibly for different audiences and purposes within the same piece, and evaluating how published writers make audience and purpose choices. | A charity wants to raise money for clean water in developing countries. They need three texts: a fundraising letter to parents, a fact sheet for children, and a social media post. Write the opening of each and explain how you adapted your choices. | Using the same tone and register across all three versions; Not explaining the specific choices made for each audience |

> **Model response (Entry):** *The letter to a friend is for someone I know well. Its purpose is to share news in a chatty way. The letter to the headteacher is for an adult in authority. Its purpose is to request something politely.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *I would choose the letter to the council because it can include detailed arguments. The language would be formal and polite because I am writing to adults in authority. I would use phrases like 'I am writing to request' and give evidence for my points. A poster would need to be short, eye-catching and use simpler language because it is for a quick glance, not a careful read.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Newspaper: 'Hundreds of residents gathered in Victoria Park on Saturday for the annual Summer Fair, which raised over two thousand pounds for the local hospital.' Diary: 'What an amazing day! The Summer Fair was brilliant. Mum let me go on the bouncy castle three times and I won a goldfish.' In the newspaper report I used third person, formal language and the most important fact first because the audience is the general public and the purpose is to inform. In the diary I used first person, informal language and personal feelings because the audience is myself and the purpose is to record my experience.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *Parent letter: 'Dear Parent/Carer, Every child deserves access to clean drinking water. Your donation of just five pounds could provide safe water for a family for a month.' Child fact sheet: 'Did you know? 1 in 10 people around the world do not have clean water to drink. That is like 3 children in every class having no safe water at home.' Social media: 'Clean water changes everything. Five pounds. One family. One month. Donate now.' Each adapts to its audience: formal and emotional for parents, accessible and relatable for children, punchy and shareable for social media. The purpose is the same (fundraising) but the form, register and techniques change completely.*

### Secondary concept: Cohesive devices and paragraph linking (EN-Y5-C025)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

Cohesive devices are words and phrases that connect ideas within and across paragraphs, creating a coherent, unified text. At Year 5, these include devices within paragraphs (then, after that, this, firstly) and linking adverbials across paragraphs referring to time (later), place (nearby) and number (secondly), as well as tense choices that signal temporal relationships. Mastery means pupils deploy a wide range of these devices deliberately and appropriately.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Using basic time connectives (then, next, after that) to link ideas within a paragraph. | Using 'then' repeatedly as the only linking word; Joining all sentences with 'and' without varying the connective |
| **Developing** | Using a range of cohesive devices within paragraphs (then, after that, this, firstly) and beginning to link paragraphs using adverbials of time, place or number. | Using only time connectives without varying with place or manner; Starting a new paragraph without any link to the previous one |
| **Expected** | Deploying a wide range of cohesive devices deliberately and appropriately, organised by function (time, place, number, addition, contrast, consequence), to build coherent, well-structured texts. | Using cohesive devices that do not match the logical relationship (writing 'however' when 'therefore' is needed); Inserting devices mechanically without ensuring they genuinely connect the ideas |
| **Greater Depth** | Using cohesive devices with subtlety and variety, including pronoun references, synonyms, and tense choices as well as adverbials, to create seamless, professional-sounding prose. | Identifying problems but not being able to articulate why the revision is better; Over-correcting by removing all repetition, making the text unclear about what 'they' or 'this' refers to |

### Secondary concept: Modal verbs (EN-Y5-C029)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Modal verbs (might, should, will, must, can, could, would, may, shall, ought to) express degrees of possibility, necessity, certainty or permission. At upper KS2 mastery, pupils use modal verbs purposefully to indicate degrees of certainty in writing, understand that modal verbs are followed by an infinitive without 'to', and can discuss the effect of choosing one modal verb over another. This is Year 5-specific grammar in Appendix 2.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recognising common modal verbs (can, will, might, must) and understanding that they express possibility or certainty. | Treating all modal verbs as meaning the same thing; Not understanding that 'must' expresses strong obligation or certainty, not just emphasis |
| **Developing** | Using modal verbs to express different degrees of possibility in writing and explaining how changing the modal changes the meaning. | Using 'can' and 'could' interchangeably without recognising the difference in certainty; Writing 'should of' instead of 'should have' |
| **Expected** | Using modal verbs purposefully in writing to indicate degrees of possibility, necessity or certainty, and understanding how modal choice affects register and meaning. | Using only 'will' and 'can' without exploring the full range of modals; Not recognising that modal verbs are essential in science and non-fiction writing for hedging claims |
| **Greater Depth** | Selecting modal verbs with precision to control tone and register, combining modals with adverbs to fine-tune degrees of possibility, and identifying how modal choice affects persuasion. | Analysing the meaning of the modals but not discussing the power dynamics they create; Not recognising that modal choice is a key tool for controlling register in formal writing |

### Secondary concept: Passive voice (EN-Y5-C030)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

The passive voice occurs when the grammatical subject of a verb receives the action rather than performing it (e.g., 'The window was broken by Tom' rather than 'Tom broke the window'). At upper KS2 mastery, pupils can construct passive sentences, identify them in texts, and understand when and why writers choose the passive — particularly to change focus, to omit the agent, or to create an impersonal, formal tone.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Understanding that a sentence can be written in two ways: active (the subject does the action) and passive (the subject receives the action), with teacher modelling. | Thinking the two sentences have different meanings rather than different emphasis; Not noticing the structural change (subject and object have swapped position) |
| **Developing** | Converting simple active sentences into passive and identifying the passive construction ('be' + past participle), noting that the agent ('by...') is optional. | Forgetting to use the correct form of 'be' (was/were) before the past participle; Including the agent when it would be better omitted |
| **Expected** | Using passive voice purposefully in writing, understanding when and why writers choose passive over active (to change focus, omit the agent, or create a formal tone), and identifying passive constructions in texts. | Confusing past tense with passive voice (thinking 'I heated' is passive because it is past tense); Using passive in all writing once learned, without selecting it purposefully |
| **Greater Depth** | Analysing how published writers and public figures use passive voice strategically, including to avoid responsibility or create deliberate ambiguity. | Recognising the grammatical difference but not analysing the rhetorical purpose; Assuming passive voice is always bad writing rather than understanding it as a strategic choice |

### Secondary concept: Public speaking and formal debate (EN-Y5-C035)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

In Years 5 and 6, pupils' confidence, enjoyment and mastery of language should be extended through public speaking, performance and debate. At upper KS2 mastery, pupils can give structured spoken presentations, argue a position in formal debate, use notes purposefully, maintain focus on a topic, and evaluate different viewpoints, building on others' contributions courteously.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Contributing a spoken point or opinion in a whole-class or small-group discussion, with some structure provided by the teacher. | Stating an opinion without giving any reason; Speaking too quietly for the group to hear |
| **Developing** | Giving a short spoken presentation using notes as prompts, and beginning to respond to others' points in discussion. | Reading a prepared script word for word rather than speaking from notes; Not responding to the question and instead repeating part of the prepared talk |
| **Expected** | Giving structured formal presentations and participating in debates with proposition, opposition and rebuttal, maintaining focus on the topic, using notes where necessary, and evaluating different viewpoints courteously. | Repeating the same point more loudly rather than addressing the opposing argument; Confusing personal feelings with structured argument |
| **Greater Depth** | Leading and managing formal discussions, evaluating the strength of arguments (including their own), adapting register for formal contexts, and using rhetorical techniques to persuade. | Showing bias towards one side when chairing rather than maintaining neutrality; Summing up by choosing the side they agree with rather than evaluating argument quality |

## Thinking lens: Evidence and Argument (primary)

**Key question:** What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?

**Why this lens fits:** Formal debate is a structured form of evidence-based argumentation — pupils must construct claims, anticipate counter-arguments, and deploy evidence in real time to persuade an audience.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- What evidence supports this claim?
- Is this a fact or an opinion? How can you tell?
- Is this strong evidence or weak evidence? Why?
- Can you structure your argument: claim, evidence, reasoning?

**Secondary lens:** Structure and Function — Audience, purpose and form (APF) is the organising framework that explicitly asks pupils to connect structural and stylistic choices to their communicative function — every decision should serve the identified purpose for the specified audience.

---

## Session structure: Discussion and Debate

### Discussion and Debate
A structured sequence for exploring contested issues or multiple perspectives. Begins with a stimulus that raises a question or dilemma, builds knowledge through research, develops arguments through structured discussion techniques, captures thinking in writing, and reflects on how views may have changed.

`stimulus` → `research` → `structured_discussion` → `writing` → `reflection`

**Assessment:** Balanced written argument or persuasive piece demonstrating understanding of multiple perspectives, supported by evidence, with a reasoned personal conclusion.

**Teacher note:** Use the DISCUSSION AND DEBATE template: present a clear stimulus such as a statement, image, or short text that prompts different viewpoints. Give pupils time to research or gather evidence for their position. Use a structured discussion format with clear rules for listening and responding. Guide them to write up their view with reasons and evidence.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What do you think about this? Why?
- Can you give a reason for your opinion?
- What might someone who disagrees say?
- Can you write down your view with your best reason?

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Non Fiction
**Features to teach:** formal academic register, cohesive devices linking paragraphs, hedging language (may, could, tends to), evidence-based argumentation, counter-argument and rebuttal

**Writing outcome:** Write an extended balanced argument (500-700 words) on a topical issue with evidence from multiple sources, formal register, and a nuanced conclusion

**Grammar focus:** modal verbs for hedging, cohesive devices across paragraphs, passive voice for formality
*(from Y5 Appendix 2)*

**Literary terms:** register, hedging, modal verb, passive voice, cohesion, evidence

---

## Suggested texts

- **Model discussion texts (teacher-curated)** by Various — Exemplars with annotated cohesive devices and hedging language
- **First News / The Week Junior articles** by Various — Age-appropriate news articles presenting multiple viewpoints

---

## Genre

- **Persuasion:** Texts that argue a single point of view using rhetorical and emotional techniques to convince the reader. Distinct from discussion (which is balanced): persuasion is deliberately one-sided. Teaches pupils to identify and deploy techniques including rhetorical questions, emotive language, repetition, and direct address.
- **Discussion:** Texts that present multiple viewpoints on a debatable issue, reaching a justified conclusion. More demanding than persuasion because pupils must hold two opposing positions in mind simultaneously and treat both fairly. Often paired with spoken language (debate) to develop oracy alongside writing.

---

## Why this study matters

At Y5, discussion writing becomes more analytically demanding. Pupils must move beyond simple for/against to acknowledge complexity, use hedging language (may, could, tends to), and build cohesion across paragraphs. The formal debate component develops the spoken language competence needed for secondary school. Modal verbs and passive voice are statutory Y5 grammar and fit naturally into academic register.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Arguments are still binary (for/against) without acknowledging nuance or complexity
2. Modal verbs and passive voice used because the teacher says so, not because the register demands them
3. Conclusion simply repeats the strongest argument rather than genuinely weighing the evidence

---

## Reading and writing skills (KS2)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Word meaning from context** — Understand the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in simple texts by using the surrounding context, including pictures and sentence sense, to make a reasonable guess at what the word means.
- **Information retrieval from simple texts** — Find and report specific information or key facts from a short piece of fiction or non-fiction, identifying the part of the text where the answer is located.
- **Retelling and sequencing** — Retell the main events of a story or the key steps in a non-fiction text, placing them in the correct order and identifying the most important ideas.
- **Simple inference from text** — Use clues in the text — characters' words, actions and feelings — to work out something the author has not stated directly, and begin to explain the reasoning behind that interpretation.
- **Prediction from text clues** — Predict what is likely to happen next in a story or sequence of events, drawing on what has already been read and on prior knowledge of similar texts and situations.
- **Noticing interesting words and phrases** — Identify and discuss words and phrases that capture attention or create an effect, beginning to explain what makes them interesting, surprising or effective in the context of the text.
