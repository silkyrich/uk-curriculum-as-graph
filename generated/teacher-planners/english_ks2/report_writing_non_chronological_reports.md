## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Retrieving and recording information from non-fiction (EN-Y3-C031)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Pupils locate specific information in non-fiction texts using contents pages and indexes, knowing what information they need before beginning

**Teaching guidance:** Teach children to retrieve and record information from non-fiction texts. Model using contents pages, indexes and glossaries to locate specific information. Teach note-taking strategies: using bullet points, using own words rather than copying, and recording the source. Provide structured research tasks where children must find and record specific information. Teach the difference between retrieving (finding facts that are stated) and interpreting (working out what facts mean). Connect to cross-curricular research in history, geography and science.

**Key vocabulary:** retrieve, record, information, non-fiction, contents, index, glossary, notes, source, fact, research

**Common misconceptions:** Children often copy chunks of text verbatim rather than recording information in their own words. They may not use navigational features (contents, index) to find information efficiently, instead reading entire texts from start to finish. Some children struggle to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information when researching a specific question.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Finding a single piece of information in a non-fiction text when told which page or section to look in. | Look at page 12 of this book about dinosaurs. Find the name of the biggest dinosaur. | Reading the whole page from start to finish instead of scanning for the specific information; Giving information from a different page or section |
| **Developing** | Using a contents page or index to locate information in a non-fiction text and recording it in own words. | Use the contents page of this book to find the section about what Victorian children ate. Write one fact in your own words. | Copying a sentence from the book rather than using own words; Not using the contents page and instead flicking through randomly |
| **Expected** | Retrieving and recording information from multiple sections of a non-fiction text to answer a research question, using navigational features efficiently. | Use this non-fiction book to find out three facts about how Ancient Egyptians built the pyramids. Use the index and contents page to find your information. Record your facts in your own words. | Recording facts that are interesting but don't answer the specific research question; Copying text word-for-word rather than putting information into own words |
| **Greater Depth** | Synthesising information from multiple non-fiction sources, comparing what different sources say about the same topic and noting agreements or discrepancies. | Use these two different books about space to find out about the temperature on Mars. Do the books agree? Record what each says. | Treating all sources as equally reliable without comparing them; Recording information from only one source when asked to use multiple |

> **Model response (Entry):** *'It says the Argentinosaurus was the biggest dinosaur.' (Points to the relevant sentence.)*

> **Model response (Developing):** *'I found it in Chapter 4 on page 18. Victorian children who were poor often ate bread and dripping for their meals.'*

> **Model response (Expected):** *'1. Thousands of workers pulled huge stone blocks along sand that had been made wet to reduce friction. 2. Ramps were probably used to move blocks up to higher levels. 3. Workers were not slaves — they were paid and lived in nearby villages.' (Notes page numbers for each fact.)*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *'Book A says the average temperature on Mars is minus 60 degrees Celsius. Book B says it ranges from minus 140 to 20 degrees Celsius. They don't exactly disagree — Book B gives more detail, showing that the temperature varies a lot. Book A just gives the average. Using both sources gives a more complete picture.'*

### Secondary concept: Language, structure and presentation contributing to meaning (EN-Y3-C030)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Pupils understand how authors use language choices, text structure and presentational features to convey meaning, including conventions of different text types

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Noticing a basic presentational feature in a non-fiction text, such as a heading or a picture with a caption. | Not understanding that a heading tells you what the section is about; Confusing the heading with the title of the whole book |
| **Developing** | Identifying how an author uses specific language choices or structural features to create an effect, with prompting. | Saying the language is 'good' without explaining the effect; Not recognising that the author chose specific words deliberately |
| **Expected** | Discussing how language choices, text structure and presentational features contribute to meaning across different text types. | Describing the differences without explaining why each text type uses these features; Focusing only on language and ignoring structural or presentational features |
| **Greater Depth** | Evaluating the effectiveness of an author's language and structural choices, suggesting how different choices might change the reader's experience. | Identifying the technique without explaining its effect on the reader; Not being able to suggest how alternative choices would change the effect |

### Secondary concept: Organisational devices in non-narrative writing (EN-Y3-C049)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Pupils structure non-fiction writing using simple organisational devices such as headings and sub-headings

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recognising basic organisational features in a non-fiction text, such as a heading or a title. | Confusing the heading with the first sentence of the text; Not understanding that headings serve a purpose beyond decoration |
| **Developing** | Using a heading and simple sub-headings in own non-fiction writing, with teacher guidance. | Writing sub-headings that don't clearly signal what follows; Placing all information under one heading rather than splitting it logically |
| **Expected** | Structuring non-fiction writing using headings, sub-headings and other organisational devices such as bullet points or numbered lists, matched to purpose. | Using bullet points where continuous prose would be more appropriate; Headings that are too vague to guide the reader (e.g., 'More Information') |
| **Greater Depth** | Choosing and combining organisational devices effectively, considering how they help the reader navigate and understand the information. | Using organisational features inconsistently or decoratively rather than purposefully; Not being able to justify why particular features were chosen |

### Secondary concept: Paragraphs to group related material (EN-Y3-C063)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Pupils understand paragraphs as a way to group related material, introduced as an organisational concept in Year 3

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Understanding that a paragraph is a group of sentences about the same topic, separated from other paragraphs by a gap. | Counting sentences instead of paragraphs; Not being able to identify what each paragraph is about |
| **Developing** | Writing related sentences together in a paragraph, keeping to one topic per paragraph in non-fiction writing. | Mixing topics within a paragraph (e.g., describing the playground in the building paragraph); Writing all information as one continuous block |
| **Expected** | Using paragraphs consistently in extended writing to group related material, starting new paragraphs for changes in time, place, topic or speaker. | Breaking paragraphs at arbitrary points rather than meaningful shifts; Understanding when to start a new paragraph in theory but not applying it consistently in writing |
| **Greater Depth** | Using paragraphs as a structural tool, including linking between paragraphs with connectives or topic sentences, and varying paragraph length for effect. | Writing paragraphs that are self-contained but don't connect to each other; Using topic sentences that are too vague to guide the paragraph content |

### Secondary concept: Headings and sub-headings (EN-Y3-C064)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Pupils understand and use headings and sub-headings to aid presentation and organise information texts

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying a heading in a non-fiction text and understanding that it tells the reader what the section is about. | Confusing the heading with the first sentence of the text; Not understanding the purpose of a heading |
| **Developing** | Writing a clear heading and sub-headings for a non-fiction text when guided by a plan. | Writing sub-headings that are too vague (e.g., 'More Information' or 'Other Stuff'); Writing sub-headings that are full sentences rather than concise labels |
| **Expected** | Using headings and sub-headings purposefully in own non-fiction writing to organise content and help the reader navigate the text. | Including information under the wrong sub-heading; Using headings that don't accurately represent the content beneath them |
| **Greater Depth** | Choosing headings and sub-headings that are informative, engaging and accurately reflect the hierarchical structure of the information. | Prioritising catchy headings at the expense of clarity; Not distinguishing between the level of headings and sub-headings |

## Thinking lens: Perspective and Interpretation (primary)

**Key question:** Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?

**Why this lens fits:** Reading across genres and for different purposes develops pupils' capacity to adopt different reading stances — the reader of fiction interprets character and theme while the reader of non-fiction evaluates information.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- Who wrote or made this, and why?
- What might they have left out?
- How does this account compare to another version of the same event?
- What experience or belief might have shaped this person's view?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Drawing inferences with evidence and identifying main ideas are explicitly evidence-grounded skills — pupils must locate textual support for their interpretive claims, not just state what they think.

---

## Session structure: Text Study

### Text Study
A reading-to-writing cycle for primary and KS3 English. Begins with shared or guided reading of a high-quality text, moves through analysis of language features and authorial choices, builds vocabulary, then scaffolds the writing process from planning through drafting to editing and publication.

`shared_reading` → `analysis` → `vocabulary` → `planning` → `drafting` → `editing`

**Assessment:** Final written outcome in the genre studied, demonstrating understanding of text features, appropriate vocabulary use, and effective application of the writing process.

**Teacher note:** Use the TEXT STUDY template: share a quality text and guide pupils to analyse the author's choices — vocabulary, sentence structure, and literary techniques. Build subject-specific vocabulary through discussion. Support pupils in planning and drafting their own writing, applying techniques they have identified. Include time for editing and improving their work.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What effect does the author create with this word or phrase?
- Why did the author structure the text this way?
- What technique could you borrow for your own writing?
- How could you improve this section of your draft?

---

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Non Fiction
**Features to teach:** subheadings for organisation, topic sentences to open paragraphs, present tense for general truths, formal register, technical vocabulary

**Writing outcome:** Write a non-chronological report (300-500 words) about a curriculum topic with subheadings, topic sentences, technical vocabulary, and a labelled diagram

**Grammar focus:** headings and sub-headings, paragraphs to group related material, present tense for factual statements
*(from Y3 Appendix 2)*

**Literary terms:** formal register, topic sentence, technical vocabulary, third person

---

## Suggested texts

- **DK Eyewitness: Rocks and Minerals** by DK — Clear non-fiction layout for modelling report structure
- **National Geographic Kids: Everything Rocks and Minerals** by Steve Tomecek — Accessible layout with subheadings and technical vocabulary

---

## Genre

- **Report:** Texts that present factual information organised by topic rather than chronologically. A core non-fiction form across KS1-KS3 that develops research, retrieval, and organisational skills. Cross-curricular by nature: report writing in English draws on content from Science, Geography, and History.

---

## Why this study matters

Non-chronological reports are the gateway to academic writing. At Y3, the focus is on organising information under subheadings and using topic sentences — skills that transfer to every subject. Cross-curricular links (Science rocks, Geography rivers) provide authentic content so that the English lesson teaches the writing form while another subject provides the knowledge.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Information copied from source without being reorganised or put in own words
2. Subheadings added but content under each heading is not grouped logically
3. Formal register drops into chatty, informal language mid-paragraph

---

## Cross-curricular opportunities

| Link | Subject | Connection | Strength |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| Rivers and the Water Cycle | Geography | Rivers, weather, local area study | Strong |
| Rocks and Fossils Classification | Science | Rocks and soils, plants, animals — any topic with factual content to organise | Strong |

---

## Reading and writing skills (KS2)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Word meaning from context** — Understand the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in simple texts by using the surrounding context, including pictures and sentence sense, to make a reasonable guess at what the word means.
- **Information retrieval from simple texts** — Find and report specific information or key facts from a short piece of fiction or non-fiction, identifying the part of the text where the answer is located.
- **Retelling and sequencing** — Retell the main events of a story or the key steps in a non-fiction text, placing them in the correct order and identifying the most important ideas.
- **Simple inference from text** — Use clues in the text — characters' words, actions and feelings — to work out something the author has not stated directly, and begin to explain the reasoning behind that interpretation.
- **Prediction from text clues** — Predict what is likely to happen next in a story or sequence of events, drawing on what has already been read and on prior knowledge of similar texts and situations.
- **Noticing interesting words and phrases** — Identify and discuss words and phrases that capture attention or create an effect, beginning to explain what makes them interesting, surprising or effective in the context of the text.

## Scaffolding and inclusion (Y3)

| Guideline | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Reading level | Developing Reader (Lexile 150–350) |
| Text-to-speech | Available |
| Max sentence length | 14 words |
| Vocabulary | Subject vocabulary with inline glossary support. Abstract concepts grounded in familiar contexts. Similes and comparisons helpful (e.g., 'solid is like a brick'). |
| Scaffolding level | Moderate To High |
| Hint tiers | 3 tiers |
| Session length | 12–20 minutes |
| Worked examples | Required — Text + diagram narrated. Step-by-step with child input at key points ('What would you do next?'). |
| Feedback tone | Warm Competence Focused |
| Normalize struggle | Yes |
| Example correct feedback | *You spotted the pattern — all the multiples of 6 end in an even number. That is a really useful thing to notice.* |
| Example error feedback | *That one got you — 7×8 trips up a lot of people. Here is a trick: 7×7 is 49, so 7×8 is just 7 more, which gives 56.* |
