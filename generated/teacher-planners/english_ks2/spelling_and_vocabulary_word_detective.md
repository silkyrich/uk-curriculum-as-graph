## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **7 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Root words for reading and meaning (EN-Y4-C013)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Pupils apply growing knowledge of root words alongside etymology and morphology to read aloud and comprehend new words, supporting vocabulary development rather than decoding alone

**Teaching guidance:** Build on Year 3 root word knowledge by introducing Latin and Greek roots found in subject-specific vocabulary across the curriculum. Examples: 'aqua' (water), 'bio' (life), 'geo' (earth), 'port' (carry), 'rupt' (break), 'struct' (build), 'tele' (far). Use word webs to show how a single root generates multiple words. When encountering unfamiliar vocabulary in science, geography or history, prompt children to identify the root word and use it to infer meaning. Create class root word collections for each subject area.

**Key vocabulary:** root word, Latin, Greek, origin, word family, meaning, derive, vocabulary, subject-specific, infer

**Common misconceptions:** Children may not connect root word knowledge to reading comprehension, treating it as a separate spelling activity. They may misidentify root words in words that are not etymologically related (e.g., thinking 'television' and 'telephone' share the root 'tel' when the actual root is 'tele-'). Some children memorise roots without understanding how to apply them to new vocabulary.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying the root word within a familiar word that has a prefix or suffix. | What is the root word in each of these: unhappy, playing, darkness? | Removing too many letters (e.g., 'play' → 'pla'); Confusing root word with the first syllable |
| **Developing** | Using known root words to read and understand unfamiliar words by identifying how prefixes and suffixes change meaning. | You come across the word 'misunderstand' in your reading. Break it into parts and explain what it means. | Knowing the root word but not how the prefix changes its meaning; Pronouncing the word but not using root knowledge to work out meaning |
| **Expected** | Applying root word knowledge alongside etymology to read aloud and comprehend unfamiliar words across subjects. | In your science book, you read: 'Herbivores consume only vegetation.' Use root word knowledge to explain what 'herbivore' and 'vegetation' mean. | Guessing meaning from the sound of the word rather than analysing its parts; Knowing one root but not connecting it to related words |
| **Greater Depth** | Using root word families to predict the meanings of multiple unfamiliar words and explain the connections between them. | The Latin root 'port' means 'to carry'. List four words containing this root and explain how 'carry' connects to each meaning. | Including words that contain 'port' but are not etymologically related (e.g., 'portico'); Giving definitions without explaining the root connection |

> **Model response (Entry):** *unhappy → happy, playing → play, darkness → dark*

> **Model response (Developing):** *mis- means wrongly, and the root word is 'understand'. So misunderstand means to understand something wrongly or incorrectly.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Herbi- comes from the Latin word for plant (like 'herb') and -vore means eater (like 'devour'). So a herbivore is a plant-eater. Vegetation comes from the Latin root 'vegetare' meaning to grow, so vegetation means plants and growing things.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *Transport — carry across (trans = across). Export — carry out (ex = out of a country). Import — carry in. Portable — able to be carried. They all connect to the idea of carrying or moving things from one place to another.*

## Thinking lens: Patterns (primary)

**Key question:** What patterns can I notice here, and what do they allow me to predict?

**Why this lens fits:** Morphological and etymological analysis is a pattern-application strategy: pupils use the systematic structure of roots, prefixes and suffixes as clues that generalise across all words sharing those elements.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- What pattern can you see?
- Does this always happen, or can you find an exception?
- What rule connects these examples?
- What would you predict for the next one? Why?

**Secondary lens:** Structure and Function — Understanding why words are structured as they are (etymology) and how those structures produce meaning (morphology) is a direct application of structure-function thinking to vocabulary.

## Session structure: Writer's Workshop

### Writer's Workshop
A process-writing sequence that develops pupils as independent writers. Studies a mentor text to identify craft techniques, practises those techniques in isolation, plans an original piece, drafts with attention to audience and purpose, engages in peer review for feedback, revises and edits, and publishes the final piece.

`mentor_text` → `technique_identification` → `planning` → `drafting` → `peer_review` → `editing` → `publication`

**Assessment:** Final published piece demonstrating identified craft techniques, with writing portfolio showing development through the drafting and revision process.

**Teacher note:** Use the WRITER'S WORKSHOP template: share a mentor text and guide pupils to identify specific techniques the writer uses. Model how to plan writing that uses those techniques purposefully. Give pupils time to draft their own piece, then facilitate peer review focused on the targeted technique. Guide editing with attention to grammar, punctuation, and the effect of their choices on the reader.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What techniques does the mentor text use, and what effect do they create?
- How have you planned to use this technique in your own writing?
- What feedback did your partner give, and how will you respond to it?
- What edits will improve the clarity and impact of your writing?

## Suggested texts

- **Y3-4 statutory word list** by DfE — Statutory word list for systematic study
- **Etymological dictionaries (child-friendly)** by Various — For investigating word origins and patterns

## Why this study matters

Systematic spelling instruction at Y4 must go beyond rote memorisation to build morphological awareness through prefixes, suffixes, and root words. An investigative approach where pupils act as 'word detectives' develops etymological curiosity and transferable spelling strategies. This maps directly to the statutory Y3-4 word list and Appendix 1 spelling rules.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Spelling taught in isolation from reading and writing contexts, reducing transfer to independent work
2. Over-reliance on 'look, cover, write, check' without understanding the morphological rule behind the spelling
3. Homophones practised as pairs but not embedded in sentence-level context where the distinction matters

## Cross-curricular opportunities

| Link | Subject | Connection | Strength |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| Roman Britain | History | Etymology and word origins — Latin and Greek roots in English | Moderate |

## Reading and writing skills (KS2)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Word meaning from context** — Understand the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in simple texts by using the surrounding context, including pictures and sentence sense, to make a reasonable guess at what the word means.
- **Information retrieval from simple texts** — Find and report specific information or key facts from a short piece of fiction or non-fiction, identifying the part of the text where the answer is located.
- **Retelling and sequencing** — Retell the main events of a story or the key steps in a non-fiction text, placing them in the correct order and identifying the most important ideas.
- **Simple inference from text** — Use clues in the text — characters' words, actions and feelings — to work out something the author has not stated directly, and begin to explain the reasoning behind that interpretation.
- **Prediction from text clues** — Predict what is likely to happen next in a story or sequence of events, drawing on what has already been read and on prior knowledge of similar texts and situations.
- **Noticing interesting words and phrases** — Identify and discuss words and phrases that capture attention or create an effect, beginning to explain what makes them interesting, surprising or effective in the context of the text.

## Scaffolding and inclusion (Y4)

| Guideline | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Reading level | Fluent Reader (Emerging) (Lexile 300–500) |
| Text-to-speech | Available |
| Max sentence length | 18 words |
| Vocabulary | Curriculum vocabulary expected to be known (with in-context reminder). Some academic vocabulary (e.g., 'evidence', 'conclusion') acceptable. Technical terms in context. |
| Scaffolding level | Moderate |
| Hint tiers | 3 tiers |
| Session length | 15–25 minutes |
| Worked examples | Required — Text-based with inline questions. Not fully narrated — child reads the example. |
| Feedback tone | Respectful And Precise |
| Normalize struggle | Yes |
| Example correct feedback | *Your inference was correct — the text never said the character was nervous, but you worked it out from the clues: the short sentences and the word 'paced'. That is sophisticated reading.* |
| Example error feedback | *This is a common misconception: plants do not get their food from the soil — they make it from sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. The soil provides minerals, but food is made in the leaves.* |
