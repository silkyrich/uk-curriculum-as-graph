## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **5 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Fairy stories, myths and legends (EN-Y4-C019)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Pupils increase familiarity with fairy stories, myths and legends from a range of traditions and retell some of these orally, recognising common themes such as triumph of good over evil and use of magical devices

**Teaching guidance:** Extend knowledge of fairy stories, myths and legends through texts from diverse cultural traditions. In Year 4, deepen analysis: compare versions of the same story from different cultures (e.g., Cinderella variants from around the world), discuss how myths reflect the values and beliefs of the culture that produced them, and explore how legends blend fact and fiction. Teach children to recognise structural patterns: the hero's journey, the quest, the transformation, the trickster tale. Use as models for children's own narrative writing.

**Key vocabulary:** fairy story, myth, legend, culture, tradition, hero, quest, moral, origin story, variant, pattern

**Common misconceptions:** Children may assume that myths from other cultures are simply 'wrong explanations' rather than understanding their cultural significance. They may think that all versions of a traditional story must be the same and be surprised by cultural variations. Some children struggle to see how mythological structures are still used in modern storytelling.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Retelling a familiar fairy tale, myth or legend with key events in the correct order. | Retell the story of Theseus and the Minotaur. Include the beginning, the problem, and how it was solved. | Missing key plot events; Confusing details from different myths |
| **Developing** | Identifying common themes and features across fairy tales, myths or legends from different traditions. | You have read Cinderella and the Egyptian story of Rhodopis. What features do both stories share? | Listing plot events rather than identifying shared features; Only noticing surface similarities (both have shoes) without identifying deeper patterns |
| **Expected** | Discussing how myths and legends reflect the values and beliefs of the culture that produced them, with examples from different traditions. | Compare a Greek myth and a Norse myth. What do they tell us about what each culture valued? | Describing the myths without connecting them to cultural values; Assuming all myths teach the same lessons |
| **Greater Depth** | Analysing how mythological themes appear in modern stories and explaining why these themes endure across time and cultures. | How does the myth of Icarus connect to any modern story, film or real-life situation you know? Why do you think this theme keeps appearing? | Making a superficial connection (both involve flying) rather than a thematic one; Not explaining why the theme endures |

> **Model response (Entry):** *There was a terrible monster called the Minotaur that lived in a maze under the palace. Every year, young people were sent into the maze to be eaten. Theseus volunteered to go in and kill the Minotaur. A princess called Ariadne gave him a ball of string so he could find his way out. He fought the Minotaur and escaped by following the string back.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Both stories have a poor girl who is treated badly by others. Both have a special item (a glass slipper and a golden sandal) that helps the girl be recognised. Both end with the girl being chosen by a powerful man. Both have a magical helper.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *In Greek myths, heroes like Odysseus succeed through cleverness and strategy — the Greeks valued intelligence and cunning. In Norse myths, heroes like Thor succeed through strength and bravery in battle — the Norse valued physical courage and honour. The Greek gods live on sunny Mount Olympus; the Norse gods live in cold, harsh Asgard. This reflects the different environments and values of Mediterranean and Scandinavian cultures.*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *Icarus flew too close to the sun despite his father's warning, and his wax wings melted. This theme appears in modern stories too — for example, in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the children who ignore warnings (like Augustus Gloop eating too much) face consequences. The theme keeps appearing because people in every culture need to learn about the dangers of ignoring good advice and being overconfident. It is a universal lesson about hubris — thinking you know better than everyone else.*

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Planning from model texts involves understanding how the model's structure serves its purpose — pupils analyse what the text does and why before designing their own version with an equivalent structure.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- How does the shape or arrangement help it do its job?
- Can you find two different structures that do the same thing? How do they compare?
- If you were designing this, what would you keep and what would you change?
- Why is this material or structure better suited than another?

**Secondary lens:** Perspective and Interpretation — Reading aloud own writing and evaluating it requires adopting the perspective of the intended audience, asking whether the effect intended by the writer is the effect experienced by the reader.

## Session structure: Text Study

### Text Study
A reading-to-writing cycle for primary and KS3 English. Begins with shared or guided reading of a high-quality text, moves through analysis of language features and authorial choices, builds vocabulary, then scaffolds the writing process from planning through drafting to editing and publication.

`shared_reading` → `analysis` → `vocabulary` → `planning` → `drafting` → `editing`

**Assessment:** Final written outcome in the genre studied, demonstrating understanding of text features, appropriate vocabulary use, and effective application of the writing process.

**Teacher note:** Use the TEXT STUDY template: share a quality text and guide pupils to analyse the author's choices — vocabulary, sentence structure, and literary techniques. Build subject-specific vocabulary through discussion. Support pupils in planning and drafting their own writing, applying techniques they have identified. Include time for editing and improving their work.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What effect does the author create with this word or phrase?
- Why did the author structure the text this way?
- What technique could you borrow for your own writing?
- How could you improve this section of your draft?

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Fiction
**Features to teach:** traditional opening and ending, rule of three, good versus evil, transformation, subverted expectations (modern retellings)

**Writing outcome:** Write a fairy tale retelling (500-700 words) with a twist on the traditional version

**Grammar focus:** direct speech punctuation, fronted adverbials, pronoun choice for cohesion
*(from Y4 Appendix 2)*

**Literary terms:** narrator, perspective, archetype, convention, subversion, motif, moral

---

## Suggested texts

- **The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs** by Jon Scieszka — Classic retelling from the villain's perspective
- **Revolting Rhymes** by Roald Dahl — Subverted fairy tales in verse form
- **Traditional tales collection** by Various — Original versions for comparison

---

## Genre

- **Narrative:** Extended prose fiction with characters, setting, and a plot driven by conflict and resolution. The dominant literary form across all key stages, progressing from simple retelling (KS1) through structured narrative (KS2) to literary fiction with controlled voice and style (KS3-KS4).
- **Traditional Tale:** Stories passed down through oral tradition with archetypal characters, repetitive structures, and moral lessons. The entry point to narrative for KS1 children because the familiar structures scaffold retelling and independent composition. Includes fairy tales, myths, legends, fables, and folk tales.

---

## Why this study matters

Comparing traditional fairy tales with modern retellings develops critical reading skills, particularly inference about character motives and thematic understanding. The retelling task scaffolds narrative writing effectively because pupils already know the plot structure and can focus on language choices, perspective shifts, and subverting reader expectations rather than generating plot from scratch.

---

## Sequencing

**Follows:** Adventure Narrative: The Iron Man

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. The 'twist' is superficial (changing names only) rather than a genuine subversion of expectations or perspective
2. Pupils struggle to maintain fairy tale conventions while simultaneously subverting them
3. Comparison work stays at plot level without exploring how language and perspective create different effects

---

## Reading and writing skills (KS2)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Word meaning from context** — Understand the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in simple texts by using the surrounding context, including pictures and sentence sense, to make a reasonable guess at what the word means.
- **Information retrieval from simple texts** — Find and report specific information or key facts from a short piece of fiction or non-fiction, identifying the part of the text where the answer is located.
- **Retelling and sequencing** — Retell the main events of a story or the key steps in a non-fiction text, placing them in the correct order and identifying the most important ideas.
- **Simple inference from text** — Use clues in the text — characters' words, actions and feelings — to work out something the author has not stated directly, and begin to explain the reasoning behind that interpretation.
- **Prediction from text clues** — Predict what is likely to happen next in a story or sequence of events, drawing on what has already been read and on prior knowledge of similar texts and situations.
- **Noticing interesting words and phrases** — Identify and discuss words and phrases that capture attention or create an effect, beginning to explain what makes them interesting, surprising or effective in the context of the text.

## Scaffolding and inclusion (Y4)

| Guideline | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Reading level | Fluent Reader (Emerging) (Lexile 300–500) |
| Text-to-speech | Available |
| Max sentence length | 18 words |
| Vocabulary | Curriculum vocabulary expected to be known (with in-context reminder). Some academic vocabulary (e.g., 'evidence', 'conclusion') acceptable. Technical terms in context. |
| Scaffolding level | Moderate |
| Hint tiers | 3 tiers |
| Session length | 15–25 minutes |
| Worked examples | Required — Text-based with inline questions. Not fully narrated — child reads the example. |
| Feedback tone | Respectful And Precise |
| Normalize struggle | Yes |
| Example correct feedback | *Your inference was correct — the text never said the character was nervous, but you worked it out from the clues: the short sentences and the word 'paced'. That is sophisticated reading.* |
| Example error feedback | *This is a common misconception: plants do not get their food from the soil — they make it from sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. The soil provides minerals, but food is made in the leaves.* |
