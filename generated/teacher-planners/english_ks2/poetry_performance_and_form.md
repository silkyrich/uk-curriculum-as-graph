## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **3 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Poetry and play performance (EN-Y4-C021)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Pupils prepare poems and play scripts to read aloud and perform, showing understanding through intonation, tone, volume and action, using drama to explore meaning and comprehension

**Teaching guidance:** Provide regular, purposeful opportunities for children to prepare and perform poems and play scripts. In Year 4, increase expectations for performance quality: appropriate use of tone, volume, pace, emphasis, pause, gesture and movement. Teach children to analyse a text before performing it, making deliberate choices about how to convey meaning and mood. Use group performance to develop ensemble skills — reading in unison, splitting parts, using dramatic pauses. Connect to writing by having children write their own scripts and poems for performance.

**Key vocabulary:** perform, rehearse, script, poem, expression, tone, emphasis, pause, gesture, movement, ensemble

**Common misconceptions:** Children may prioritise volume over expression, thinking that speaking loudly equals performing well. They may not understand that performance choices should be driven by the meaning of the text. Some children memorise texts mechanically without understanding them deeply enough to perform expressively.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Reading aloud a short poem with basic expression, varying volume for emphasis. | Read aloud the poem 'The Owl and the Pussycat' (first verse). Try to make it sound interesting, not flat. | Reading in a flat monotone; Rushing through without pausing at line endings |
| **Developing** | Preparing a performance of a poem or play script, making choices about intonation and tone to convey meaning. | Prepare to perform the witches' chant from Macbeth: 'Double, double toil and trouble; Fire burn and cauldron bubble.' How will you use your voice to create atmosphere? | Performing loudly throughout without variation; Not connecting vocal choices to the mood of the text |
| **Expected** | Performing poems and play scripts showing clear understanding through deliberate use of intonation, tone, volume, pace and action. | Perform two contrasting poems: a funny poem and a serious poem. Show through your performance that you understand the different moods. | Performing both poems in the same style; Using exaggerated expression that obscures rather than conveys meaning |
| **Greater Depth** | Analysing how performance choices affect the audience's understanding and making different interpretive choices for the same text. | Perform the same poem twice with two different interpretations. Explain what you changed and how it altered the meaning. | Making only superficial changes (louder/quieter) rather than interpretive ones; Unable to explain how the changes affected meaning |

> **Model response (Entry):** *[Reads with some variation in tone, emphasising rhyming words and slowing for the final line]*

> **Model response (Developing):** *[Starts quietly, building volume] 'Double, double [rhythmic, like a spell] toil and trouble; [voice rises] Fire BURN [emphasis] and cauldron BUBBLE [drawn out, sinister]'*

> **Model response (Expected):** *[Funny poem: quick pace, varied pitch, exaggerated emphasis, pauses for comic timing. Serious poem: slower pace, quieter volume, measured pauses, sincere tone with careful emphasis on key images]*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *First time, I read 'I wandered lonely as a cloud' in a sad, slow voice because the speaker is alone. Second time, I read it in a dreamy, peaceful voice because the speaker is enjoying being alone in nature. I changed the pace and tone — sad version had long pauses and falling intonation; peaceful version had a lilting rhythm and rising inflections. The same words can mean different things depending on how you read them.*

### Secondary concept: Effective language in texts (EN-Y4-C022)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Pupils discuss words and phrases that capture the reader's interest and imagination, extending their interest in the meaning and origin of words

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying words or phrases in a text that they find interesting or effective. | Saying 'I like the description' without identifying specific words; Identifying words but not explaining why they are effective |
| **Developing** | Discussing how an author's word choices create specific effects on the reader, using terms like simile and alliteration. | Naming the technique without explaining the effect; Saying 'it makes it more interesting' without being specific about how |
| **Expected** | Analysing how language choices work together to create mood, atmosphere or character, discussing the author's likely intention. | Listing techniques without explaining how they work together; Analysing individual words without connecting them to the overall mood |
| **Greater Depth** | Evaluating whether an author's language choices are effective and suggesting alternatives, explaining how the effect would change. | Assuming published writing is always perfect and cannot be improved; Suggesting alternatives that are weaker than the original without recognising it |

### Secondary concept: Forms of poetry (EN-Y4-C023)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Pupils recognise some different forms of poetry and their characteristics, including free verse and narrative poetry

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recognising that poems come in different forms and identifying basic features like rhyme and rhythm. | Noticing only whether the poem rhymes or not; Thinking all poems must rhyme |
| **Developing** | Identifying different poetry forms by their characteristics, including free verse, narrative poetry and acrostic poems. | Confusing free verse with badly written poetry; Thinking narrative poetry must rhyme |
| **Expected** | Understanding how the form of a poem shapes its content and effect, appreciating that poets make deliberate choices about form. | Saying the poet chose haiku because they like haiku, without analysing the effect; Not connecting the form to the content or theme |
| **Greater Depth** | Writing the same idea in two different poetic forms and explaining how the form changed the effect. | Writing both versions about the storm without analysing how the form changes the effect; Judging the rhyming version as 'better' just because it is longer |

### Secondary concept: Figurative language and academic vocabulary (EN-Y4-C063)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Pupils demonstrate understanding of figurative language, distinguish shades of meaning among related words, and use age-appropriate academic vocabulary to express and discuss ideas with precision

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying similes in a text and understanding that they compare two things using 'like' or 'as'. | Identifying the simile but not explaining the comparison; Confusing simile with metaphor |
| **Developing** | Understanding and using common figurative language (simile, metaphor, personification) and choosing precise vocabulary. | Using clichéd figurative language ('as fast as lightning'); Replacing with another vague word rather than a precise or figurative one |
| **Expected** | Using figurative language purposefully in own writing and distinguishing shades of meaning among related words. | Using all five words as simple synonyms without varying the meaning; Not explaining how the shade of meaning differs |
| **Greater Depth** | Creating original figurative language and selecting academic vocabulary precisely, explaining the effect of specific word choices. | Defaulting to clichés ('the moon was like a silver coin'); Creating a comparison that doesn't make logical sense |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Planning from model texts involves understanding how the model's structure serves its purpose — pupils analyse what the text does and why before designing their own version with an equivalent structure.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- How does the shape or arrangement help it do its job?
- Can you find two different structures that do the same thing? How do they compare?
- If you were designing this, what would you keep and what would you change?
- Why is this material or structure better suited than another?

**Secondary lens:** Perspective and Interpretation — Reading aloud own writing and evaluating it requires adopting the perspective of the intended audience, asking whether the effect intended by the writer is the effect experienced by the reader.

---

## Session structure: Text Study + Creative Response

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Text Study (main structure)
A reading-to-writing cycle for primary and KS3 English. Begins with shared or guided reading of a high-quality text, moves through analysis of language features and authorial choices, builds vocabulary, then scaffolds the writing process from planning through drafting to editing and publication.

`shared_reading` → `analysis` → `vocabulary` → `planning` → `drafting` → `editing`

**Assessment:** Final written outcome in the genre studied, demonstrating understanding of text features, appropriate vocabulary use, and effective application of the writing process.

**Teacher note:** Use the TEXT STUDY template: share a quality text and guide pupils to analyse the author's choices — vocabulary, sentence structure, and literary techniques. Build subject-specific vocabulary through discussion. Support pupils in planning and drafting their own writing, applying techniques they have identified. Include time for editing and improving their work.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What effect does the author create with this word or phrase?
- Why did the author structure the text this way?
- What technique could you borrow for your own writing?
- How could you improve this section of your draft?

### Creative Response
A creative arts or writing sequence that develops technique through exposure to exemplary work, guided exploration of techniques, structured planning, independent creation, and peer critique. Balances creative freedom with technical skill development.

`exemplar_exposure` → `technique_exploration` → `planning` → `creating` → `critique`

**Assessment:** Final creative outcome (artwork, design, written piece) accompanied by a reflective evaluation discussing techniques used, influences, and areas for development.

**Teacher note:** Use the CREATIVE RESPONSE template: share exemplar artworks or texts and guide pupils to identify specific techniques used. Provide structured opportunities to experiment with those techniques. Support planning and creating an original response that demonstrates conscious technical choices. Include time for constructive peer critique focused on the effectiveness of specific techniques.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What technique has the artist or writer used here?
- How could you use this technique in your own work?
- What choices have you made, and why?
- What feedback would help improve this piece?

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Poetry
**Features to teach:** rhythm and rhyme, imagery, figurative language (simile, metaphor, personification), verse structure, performance techniques

**Writing outcome:** Write poems in at least 2 different forms and perform one to an audience with appropriate expression, pace, and volume

**Grammar focus:** figurative language and academic vocabulary, expanded noun phrases
*(from Y4 Appendix 2)*

**Literary terms:** simile, metaphor, imagery, stanza, verse, rhyme scheme, alliteration, onomatopoeia, personification

---

## Suggested texts

- **The Works: Every Kind of Poem** by Paul Cookson (ed.) — Comprehensive anthology with haiku, limerick, free verse, narrative poetry
- **Quick Let's Get Out of Here** by Michael Rosen — Performance-ready poems with strong voice and humour
- **Revolting Rhymes** by Roald Dahl — Narrative poetry that subverts fairy tale conventions

---

## Genre

- **Poetry:** Literature using rhythm, imagery, and condensed language to convey meaning and emotion. Poetry is continuous across all key stages with no progression break, but expectations increase: from recitation and simple pattern-following (KS1) through multiple forms and figurative language (KS2) to analysis of poetic conventions and unseen poetry comparison (KS4).

---

## Why this study matters

Poetry study at Y4 develops pupils' appreciation of language precision and sound. Exploring multiple forms (haiku, limerick, free verse, narrative poetry) builds understanding that form shapes meaning and that poets make deliberate structural choices. The performance element is a statutory spoken language requirement and builds fluency, expression, and confidence.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Focus on rhyme at the expense of meaning, imagery, and effect
2. Performance reduced to recitation without attention to expression, pace, or volume
3. Pupils write only in forms with strict rules (haiku, limerick) and avoid the challenge of free verse

## Cross-curricular opportunities

| Link | Subject | Connection | Strength |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| Composing with Structure: Rondo | Music | Rhythm and beat in poetry — links to musical metre | Moderate |

## Reading and writing skills (KS2)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Word meaning from context** — Understand the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in simple texts by using the surrounding context, including pictures and sentence sense, to make a reasonable guess at what the word means.
- **Information retrieval from simple texts** — Find and report specific information or key facts from a short piece of fiction or non-fiction, identifying the part of the text where the answer is located.
- **Retelling and sequencing** — Retell the main events of a story or the key steps in a non-fiction text, placing them in the correct order and identifying the most important ideas.
- **Simple inference from text** — Use clues in the text — characters' words, actions and feelings — to work out something the author has not stated directly, and begin to explain the reasoning behind that interpretation.
- **Prediction from text clues** — Predict what is likely to happen next in a story or sequence of events, drawing on what has already been read and on prior knowledge of similar texts and situations.
- **Noticing interesting words and phrases** — Identify and discuss words and phrases that capture attention or create an effect, beginning to explain what makes them interesting, surprising or effective in the context of the text.
