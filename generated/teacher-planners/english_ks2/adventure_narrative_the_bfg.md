## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Narrative elements: setting, character and plot (EN-Y3-C048)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Pupils develop key elements of story writing including describing settings, developing characters with distinct traits, and planning and writing story plots

**Teaching guidance:** Teach the three key elements of narrative: setting (where and when the story takes place), character (who the story is about), and plot (what happens — including a problem or conflict and its resolution). Use quality texts as models, identifying how authors establish setting through sensory description, develop characters through dialogue and action, and structure plot with tension and resolution. In Year 3, focus on creating detailed settings and developing characters beyond simple descriptions.

**Key vocabulary:** setting, character, plot, problem, resolution, describe, dialogue, action, tension, narrative, story

**Common misconceptions:** Children may rush past setting and character development to focus on action and events. They may describe characters only by physical appearance rather than personality, feelings and motivation. Some children create elaborate settings and characters but have weak or non-existent plot structures.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Writing a simple story with a clear beginning (who, where) and a sequence of events. | Write the beginning of a story. Tell the reader who the story is about and where it is set. | Starting with events before introducing the character or setting; Writing 'Once upon a time' without establishing any specific character or place |
| **Developing** | Writing a story with distinct beginning, middle and end, including a basic problem or challenge for the character. | Write a short story that includes a character, a setting, a problem, and how the problem is solved. | Creating a problem but resolving it too quickly or easily; Writing a 'bed to bed' story (I woke up... then... then... then I went to bed) without a real plot |
| **Expected** | Writing a story with developed setting, characters with distinct traits, and a structured plot with building tension and satisfying resolution. | Write a story where the main character faces a challenge. Describe the setting using sensory detail, show the character's personality through their actions and dialogue, and build tension before the resolution. | Describing characters only by appearance rather than showing personality through actions and dialogue; Resolving the story with an external rescue ('and then Mum came') rather than the character solving the problem |
| **Greater Depth** | Crafting stories with well-developed characters who change or learn, deliberately chosen settings that contribute to mood, and plots with complications or subplots. | Write a story where the main character learns something important. Make the setting contribute to the mood, and include at least one complication before the resolution. | Telling the reader what the character learned rather than showing it through events; Including complications that don't connect to the main story |

> **Model response (Entry):** *'There was a boy called Sam who lived near a big forest. One day he decided to explore the forest.'*

> **Model response (Developing):** *(Story with clear sections: beginning introduces Leila and the school; middle — she loses her cat; end — she finds the cat hiding in the garden shed. Problem and resolution are present.)*

> **Model response (Expected):** *(Story includes: setting with sensory detail — 'The cave was cold and the only sound was dripping water'; character shown through action — she checked her map carefully and whispered encouragement to herself; plot builds tension — the torch flickered, then died; resolution is earned — she remembered her grandmother's advice and felt her way using the cave wall.)*

> **Model response (Greater Depth):** *(Story where setting mirrors character mood — a grey, rainy day reflects the character's sadness after an argument. A complication occurs — the character's attempt to apologise goes wrong. Character growth — they learn that sometimes you have to be brave enough to try again. Language choices support mood and theme throughout.)*

### Secondary concept: Drawing inferences with evidence (EN-Y3-C027)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Pupils read between the lines to infer characters' feelings, thoughts and motives from their actions, justifying inferences with evidence from the text

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying a character's feeling when it is stated explicitly in the text. | Guessing the feeling based on the picture rather than finding evidence in the text; Naming a feeling without pointing to where it is stated |
| **Developing** | Inferring a character's feeling from their actions or dialogue when it is not directly stated, with support. | Stating a feeling without connecting it to evidence from the text; Confusing what the character feels with what the reader feels |
| **Expected** | Drawing inferences about characters' feelings, thoughts and motives from their actions and dialogue, justifying with specific textual evidence using the PEE structure. | Making an inference that is not supported by the text; Providing evidence but not explaining how it supports the inference |
| **Greater Depth** | Drawing inferences about complex or conflicting character motivations, recognising that characters may have mixed feelings or hidden motives, and supporting with multiple pieces of evidence. | Identifying only one feeling when the text suggests a more complex emotional response; Assuming characters always feel one thing rather than recognising mixed or evolving emotions |

### Secondary concept: Planning writing from model texts (EN-Y3-C044)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Pupils discuss writing similar to what they plan to write in order to understand and learn from its structure, vocabulary and grammar

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying basic structural features in a model text, such as the beginning, middle and end. | Saying the beginning is just the first sentence rather than the opening section; Not being able to identify where one section ends and another begins |
| **Developing** | Discussing features of a model text and borrowing structural ideas for own planning, with teacher support. | Copying the content of the model rather than borrowing the structure; Planning without referring back to the model text at all |
| **Expected** | Analysing a model text's structure, vocabulary and grammar, and using these observations to plan and write a similar text independently. | Identifying surface features (e.g., it has pictures) rather than structural and language features; Planning a text that doesn't actually use the features identified in the model |
| **Greater Depth** | Evaluating why specific structural and language choices work in a model text, and adapting (not just copying) these techniques for a different purpose or audience. | Describing the differences between the models without understanding why each text type uses those features; Copying techniques without adapting them for a different purpose or audience |

### Secondary concept: Oral rehearsal of sentences (EN-Y3-C046)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 2/6

Pupils compose and rehearse sentences orally including dialogue, progressively building varied and rich vocabulary and an increasing range of sentence structures

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Saying a simple sentence aloud before writing it, to check it makes sense. | Writing without saying the sentence aloud first; Saying one sentence but writing a different one because of memory difficulties |
| **Developing** | Rehearsing sentences orally that include expanded noun phrases or interesting vocabulary before writing them. | Rehearsing the sentence but not actually improving it before writing; Improving the sentence orally but then writing the simpler original version |
| **Expected** | Composing and rehearsing multi-clause sentences orally, including dialogue, before writing them with varied vocabulary and sentence structures. | Rehearsing simple sentences rather than the multi-clause structures being practised; Including dialogue in oral rehearsal but not punctuating it correctly in writing |
| **Greater Depth** | Using oral rehearsal to experiment with sentence structure, word choice and rhythm, selecting the most effective version before writing. | Generating variations that are too similar to each other; Choosing the longest or most complicated version rather than the most effective |

### Secondary concept: Direct speech punctuation (EN-Y3-C059)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

Pupils use and punctuate direct speech correctly, beginning with introduction to inverted commas (speech marks) and basic speech punctuation conventions

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Recognising speech marks (inverted commas) in a text and understanding that they show the words someone actually said. | Not understanding what the speech marks indicate; Thinking the whole sentence is spoken rather than just the words inside the speech marks |
| **Developing** | Writing a simple sentence of dialogue with speech marks around the spoken words and a reporting clause. | Putting speech marks around the whole sentence including the reporting clause; Forgetting to open or close the speech marks |
| **Expected** | Punctuating direct speech correctly in own writing, including speech marks, commas, reporting clauses and new lines for new speakers. | Not starting a new line for each new speaker; Placing the comma after the closing speech mark rather than before it |
| **Greater Depth** | Using direct speech effectively in narrative writing, varying the position of reporting clauses and using dialogue to reveal character and advance the plot. | Using 'said' for every reporting clause rather than varying the verb or adding description; Writing dialogue that doesn't serve a purpose in the story (e.g., greetings and small talk) |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Planning from model texts involves analysing how those texts are structured and understanding that the organisational choices serve the writer's purpose — pupils abstract structural patterns to use in their own writing.

**Question stems for KS2:**
- How does the shape or arrangement help it do its job?
- Can you find two different structures that do the same thing? How do they compare?
- If you were designing this, what would you keep and what would you change?
- Why is this material or structure better suited than another?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Evaluating and editing own writing requires pupils to assess their text against criteria — using what is on the page as evidence of whether the writing achieves its purpose, then acting on that judgement.

---

## Session structure: Text Study

### Text Study
A reading-to-writing cycle for primary and KS3 English. Begins with shared or guided reading of a high-quality text, moves through analysis of language features and authorial choices, builds vocabulary, then scaffolds the writing process from planning through drafting to editing and publication.

`shared_reading` → `analysis` → `vocabulary` → `planning` → `drafting` → `editing`

**Assessment:** Final written outcome in the genre studied, demonstrating understanding of text features, appropriate vocabulary use, and effective application of the writing process.

**Teacher note:** Use the TEXT STUDY template: share a quality text and guide pupils to analyse the author's choices — vocabulary, sentence structure, and literary techniques. Build subject-specific vocabulary through discussion. Support pupils in planning and drafting their own writing, applying techniques they have identified. Include time for editing and improving their work.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What effect does the author create with this word or phrase?
- Why did the author structure the text this way?
- What technique could you borrow for your own writing?
- How could you improve this section of your draft?

## Text type and features

**Text type:** Fiction
**Features to teach:** character description through action and dialogue, setting description using expanded noun phrases, direct speech punctuation, building atmosphere and suspense

**Writing outcome:** Write an adventure narrative chapter (400-500 words) with a character who enters a strange or magical world, using direct speech, expanded noun phrases, and a clear narrative structure

**Grammar focus:** direct speech punctuation (inverted commas), expanded noun phrases, fronted adverbials (optional introduction at Y3)
*(from Y3 Appendix 2)*

**Literary terms:** protagonist, dialogue, setting, atmosphere, suspense, narrator

---

## Suggested texts

- **The BFG** by Roald Dahl — Rich vocabulary, clear narrative structure, and accessible adventure plot
- **The Hodgeheg** by Dick King-Smith — Shorter alternative with adventure elements and humour

---

## Genre

- **Narrative:** Extended prose fiction with characters, setting, and a plot driven by conflict and resolution. The dominant literary form across all key stages, progressing from simple retelling (KS1) through structured narrative (KS2) to literary fiction with controlled voice and style (KS3-KS4).

---

## Why this study matters

The BFG provides an ideal model for Y3 adventure narrative because its portal-fantasy structure (child enters a strange world) is a clear, replicable pattern. Dahl's distinctive voice and inventive vocabulary inspire children's own language choices. The text naturally demands direct speech punctuation (the conversations between Sophie and the BFG) making grammar teaching contextual rather than decontextualised.

---

## Sequencing

**Follows:** Traditional Tales: Myths from Around the World

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Direct speech punctuation taught in isolation then not transferred to independent narrative writing
2. Character description is a static list of adjectives rather than revealed through action and dialogue
3. Adventure plot is all action with no reflective or descriptive moments

---

## Reading and writing skills (KS2)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Word meaning from context** — Understand the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in simple texts by using the surrounding context, including pictures and sentence sense, to make a reasonable guess at what the word means.
- **Information retrieval from simple texts** — Find and report specific information or key facts from a short piece of fiction or non-fiction, identifying the part of the text where the answer is located.
- **Retelling and sequencing** — Retell the main events of a story or the key steps in a non-fiction text, placing them in the correct order and identifying the most important ideas.
- **Simple inference from text** — Use clues in the text — characters' words, actions and feelings — to work out something the author has not stated directly, and begin to explain the reasoning behind that interpretation.
- **Prediction from text clues** — Predict what is likely to happen next in a story or sequence of events, drawing on what has already been read and on prior knowledge of similar texts and situations.
- **Noticing interesting words and phrases** — Identify and discuss words and phrases that capture attention or create an effect, beginning to explain what makes them interesting, surprising or effective in the context of the text.

## Scaffolding and inclusion (Y3)

| Guideline | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Reading level | Developing Reader (Lexile 150–350) |
| Text-to-speech | Available |
| Max sentence length | 14 words |
| Vocabulary | Subject vocabulary with inline glossary support. Abstract concepts grounded in familiar contexts. Similes and comparisons helpful (e.g., 'solid is like a brick'). |
| Scaffolding level | Moderate To High |
| Hint tiers | 3 tiers |
| Session length | 12–20 minutes |
| Worked examples | Required — Text + diagram narrated. Step-by-step with child input at key points ('What would you do next?'). |
| Feedback tone | Warm Competence Focused |
| Normalize struggle | Yes |
| Example correct feedback | *You spotted the pattern — all the multiples of 6 end in an even number. That is a really useful thing to notice.* |
| Example error feedback | *That one got you — 7×8 trips up a lot of people. Here is a trick: 7×7 is 49, so 7×8 is just 7 more, which gives 56.* |
