## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Mechanisms: Levers, Sliders, Wheels and Axles (DT-KS1-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Mechanisms are devices that transmit and modify motion and force. At KS1, pupils explore simple mechanisms including levers, sliders, wheels and axles, learning how these can be used to create movement in their products. Pupils investigate how levers pivot around a fulcrum, how sliders create linear movement, and how wheels turning on axles enable rolling. This concept introduces the principle that mechanical systems convert one type of input into useful output.

**Teaching guidance:** Provide ready-made mechanical components such as split pins, card strips and wheels for exploring levers and pivots. Make simple moving pictures using levers and sliders that create movement when a card is pulled. Attach wheels to simple vehicles and investigate how the diameter of wheels affects how far they travel. Examine real products that use these mechanisms. Encourage pupils to describe the movement they observe using appropriate vocabulary.

**Key vocabulary:** mechanism, lever, slider, wheel, axle, pivot, fulcrum, rotate, linear, movement, force, input, output, motion

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may confuse wheels (which rotate) with rollers or may not understand the function of an axle in keeping a wheel spinning. Practical investigation with real mechanisms is more effective than diagrammatic explanation at this stage. Pupils may not recognise that levers are found in everyday objects such as scissors, seesaws and door handles.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Creating a simple moving mechanism (lever or slider) with adult support, observing that pushing or pulling creates movement. | Use a split pin to attach this card arm to the body. Push the arm — what happens? | Fixing the split pin too tightly so the mechanism cannot move; Not understanding that the split pin is the pivot point |
| **Developing** | Incorporating a mechanism (lever, slider or wheel and axle) into a product to create intentional movement. | Make a moving picture where a character waves their arm using a lever mechanism. | Creating movement that doesn't relate to the product's purpose; Making the mechanism visible from the front when it should be hidden |
| **Expected** | Choosing and combining appropriate mechanisms for a design brief, explaining how the mechanism works and why they selected it. | Design a card with a moving part for a younger child. Choose the best mechanism and explain your choice. | Choosing a mechanism without considering the user or the intended movement; Not being able to explain how the mechanism converts the input motion to the output |

> **Model response (Entry):** *When I push the arm it moves around the split pin. The split pin is in the middle and the arm swings up and down.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *I cut out a character and a separate arm. I attached the arm with a split pin at the shoulder. I added a card strip at the back so I can push it from behind to make the arm wave.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *I chose a slider mechanism because it is simple and safe for a small child to use — they just pull a tab. I made a fish that slides across a sea scene. The slider is a card strip that moves through two slots. I chose this instead of a lever because the sliding movement looks like swimming, which matches the fish design.*

### Secondary concept: Iterative Design Process (DT-KS1-C001)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

The iterative design process involves cyclical stages of designing, making and evaluating, where each stage informs the others and products are progressively improved. At KS1, pupils are introduced to this process in a simplified form, learning that good products emerge from planning, making and reflection rather than a single attempt. The iterative nature of design means that problems discovered during making can lead to redesign, and evaluation can trigger further improvement.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Following a simple design-make-evaluate sequence with adult guidance, understanding that making involves planning before starting. | Starting to make immediately without any planning; Drawing a picture that has no connection to what they intend to make |
| **Developing** | Completing the design-make-evaluate cycle with some independence, referring back to their design during making and identifying one improvement after. | Abandoning the design completely during making without reflecting on why; Evaluating only the appearance and not the function of the product |
| **Expected** | Using the design-make-evaluate cycle independently, making purposeful changes during making based on testing, and evaluating against the original design criteria. | Not testing during making and only discovering problems at the end; Not connecting the evaluation back to the original design criteria |

### Secondary concept: Joining and Finishing Techniques (DT-KS1-C009)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Joining techniques are methods used to connect materials and components together so that a product holds its shape and structure. At KS1, pupils explore a range of joining methods including adhesives (glue, tape, staples), mechanical fixings (split pins, treasury tags, stitching) and construction techniques (folding tabs, slots). Finishing refers to the processes applied to the surface of a product after it has been assembled, such as painting, colouring or adding surface decoration, to improve its appearance and protect it.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Joining two pieces of material together using a simple method such as glue or tape. | Using too much glue so the join is weak and soggy; Not holding the pieces together while the adhesive sets |
| **Developing** | Choosing between joining methods (glue, tape, staples, split pins, stitching) based on whether the join needs to be permanent or temporary, rigid or flexible. | Using a permanent join when the brief requires movement; Not considering the functional requirements of the join |
| **Expected** | Using a range of joining and finishing techniques with skill, selecting methods that are appropriate for the materials and the design intent. | Making stitches too far apart so the join is weak; Not considering how the finishing will look on the completed product |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Setting design criteria requires pupils to articulate what the product must do (function) and how it must be structured to achieve that — the criteria themselves encode structure-function reasoning about the intended product.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What shape is it? Why do you think it is that shape?
- What job does this part do?
- What would happen if this part were a different shape?
- Can you find something else that does the same job?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Evaluating whether a design idea meets criteria is a claim-and-evidence act: pupils must justify design decisions by arguing that a particular choice satisfies the stated criteria for the intended user.

## Session structure: Design, Make, Evaluate

### Design, Make, Evaluate
The core Design & Technology cycle. Pupils investigate existing products and user needs, design a solution with clear specifications, plan the making process, construct using appropriate materials and techniques, test against the design brief, and evaluate the outcome with suggestions for improvement.

`investigate` → `design` → `plan` → `make` → `test` → `evaluate`

**Assessment:** Design portfolio including investigation findings, annotated design with specifications, making log, test results, and evaluative conclusion comparing outcome to original brief.

**Teacher note:** Use the DESIGN, MAKE AND EVALUATE template: show children existing products and help them say what they like and how they work. Support them in drawing and talking about their own design idea. Help them choose materials and make their product with adult support. Encourage them to try it out and say what worked and what they might change.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What do you like about this product? How does it work?
- Can you draw what you want to make?
- What materials will you use? Why?
- Does your product work? What would you change?

## Design and Technology: Mechanisms

**Design brief:** Design and make a picture book page with moving parts using sliders and levers. The movement must help tell a story.

**Materials:** card, split pins, paper fasteners, cardboard strips, straws, coloured paper
**Tools:** scissors, hole punch, ruler, glue stick
**Techniques:** cutting to size, joining with split pins, creating slider tracks, lever mechanisms
**Safety notes:** Adult supervision for hole punch. Ensure split pin points are flattened after insertion to prevent scratching. Demonstrate safe scissors use -- cut away from body.

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Does the slider/lever move smoothly?
- Does the movement help tell the story?
- Is the mechanism securely attached?

---

## Why this study matters

Moving picture books are an engaging first mechanisms project because the end product is immediately functional and satisfying -- the slider moves, the lever lifts, the child sees cause and effect. The project combines Art (illustration) with DT (mechanism) in a natural way. The relatively simple construction (card, split pins, paper strips) is achievable for 5-7 year olds while still teaching genuine mechanical principles.

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Slider tracks too tight -- card bows and jams
2. Split pin points not flattened -- scratch hazard
3. Pupils decorate before testing mechanism -- if mechanism fails, decoration is wasted
4. Levers too short to create visible movement -- demonstrate lever length matters
