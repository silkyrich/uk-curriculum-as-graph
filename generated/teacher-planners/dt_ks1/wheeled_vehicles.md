## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Mechanisms: Levers, Sliders, Wheels and Axles (DT-KS1-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Mechanisms are devices that transmit and modify motion and force. At KS1, pupils explore simple mechanisms including levers, sliders, wheels and axles, learning how these can be used to create movement in their products. Pupils investigate how levers pivot around a fulcrum, how sliders create linear movement, and how wheels turning on axles enable rolling. This concept introduces the principle that mechanical systems convert one type of input into useful output.

**Teaching guidance:** Provide ready-made mechanical components such as split pins, card strips and wheels for exploring levers and pivots. Make simple moving pictures using levers and sliders that create movement when a card is pulled. Attach wheels to simple vehicles and investigate how the diameter of wheels affects how far they travel. Examine real products that use these mechanisms. Encourage pupils to describe the movement they observe using appropriate vocabulary.

**Key vocabulary:** mechanism, lever, slider, wheel, axle, pivot, fulcrum, rotate, linear, movement, force, input, output, motion

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may confuse wheels (which rotate) with rollers or may not understand the function of an axle in keeping a wheel spinning. Practical investigation with real mechanisms is more effective than diagrammatic explanation at this stage. Pupils may not recognise that levers are found in everyday objects such as scissors, seesaws and door handles.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Creating a simple moving mechanism (lever or slider) with adult support, observing that pushing or pulling creates movement. | Use a split pin to attach this card arm to the body. Push the arm — what happens? | Fixing the split pin too tightly so the mechanism cannot move; Not understanding that the split pin is the pivot point |
| **Developing** | Incorporating a mechanism (lever, slider or wheel and axle) into a product to create intentional movement. | Make a moving picture where a character waves their arm using a lever mechanism. | Creating movement that doesn't relate to the product's purpose; Making the mechanism visible from the front when it should be hidden |
| **Expected** | Choosing and combining appropriate mechanisms for a design brief, explaining how the mechanism works and why they selected it. | Design a card with a moving part for a younger child. Choose the best mechanism and explain your choice. | Choosing a mechanism without considering the user or the intended movement; Not being able to explain how the mechanism converts the input motion to the output |

> **Model response (Entry):** *When I push the arm it moves around the split pin. The split pin is in the middle and the arm swings up and down.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *I cut out a character and a separate arm. I attached the arm with a split pin at the shoulder. I added a card strip at the back so I can push it from behind to make the arm wave.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *I chose a slider mechanism because it is simple and safe for a small child to use — they just pull a tab. I made a fish that slides across a sea scene. The slider is a card strip that moves through two slots. I chose this instead of a lever because the sliding movement looks like swimming, which matches the fish design.*

### Secondary concept: Structures and Stability (DT-KS1-C004)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Structures are physical constructions that support loads or maintain a form. At KS1, pupils explore how structures can be made stronger, stiffer and more stable through practical building activities. They investigate how the shape of a structure, the way it is joined and the materials it is made from all affect its strength and stability. This concept introduces foundational engineering principles through hands-on investigation.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Building a simple freestanding structure from given materials, exploring how to stop it falling over. | Building a tall, narrow structure that immediately falls over; Using excessive tape or glue instead of thinking about the structure's shape |
| **Developing** | Explaining why some structures are stronger than others and using shapes like triangles to add strength. | Believing thicker material is always stronger, without considering shape; Not understanding why folding or triangulating makes structures stronger |
| **Expected** | Designing and building a structure that meets a specific brief, explaining how the shape, materials and joining methods contribute to its strength and stability. | Building without considering load-bearing requirements; Not being able to explain why their design choices contribute to strength |

### Secondary concept: Tools, Equipment and Safe Making (DT-KS1-C008)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Tools and equipment are the instruments used to cut, shape, join and finish materials during making. At KS1, pupils learn to identify and use a range of appropriate tools including scissors, hole punches, hand saws, needles and mixing equipment, developing control and precision in their handling. Safe use of tools is an essential component of making: pupils must understand and apply basic safety rules for each tool they use, including how to hold it, how to protect themselves and others, and how to store it correctly when not in use.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Naming common tools (scissors, hole punch, ruler) and demonstrating safe handling with adult supervision. | Carrying scissors open or with blades pointing upward; Running while carrying tools |
| **Developing** | Selecting the correct tool for a task and using it with reasonable control, following safety rules independently. | Using the wrong type of scissors for the material; Cutting towards the body instead of away from it |
| **Expected** | Using a range of tools with increasing accuracy and control, measuring and marking before cutting, and maintaining a safe and organised workspace. | Cutting without marking out first, leading to inaccurate results; Not holding the ruler steady while drawing lines, causing wobbly cuts |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Selecting joining techniques requires pupils to reason about how the method of joining (gluing, stapling, sewing) must match the structural demands of the product — the function of the join determines which technique is appropriate.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What shape is it? Why do you think it is that shape?
- What job does this part do?
- What would happen if this part were a different shape?
- Can you find something else that does the same job?

**Secondary lens:** Cause and Effect — Safe tool use is built on understanding that specific actions with tools produce specific consequences — applying too much force, holding a blade incorrectly, or choosing the wrong tool each has a predictable and teachable effect.

## Session structure: Design, Make, Evaluate

### Design, Make, Evaluate
The core Design & Technology cycle. Pupils investigate existing products and user needs, design a solution with clear specifications, plan the making process, construct using appropriate materials and techniques, test against the design brief, and evaluate the outcome with suggestions for improvement.

`investigate` → `design` → `plan` → `make` → `test` → `evaluate`

**Assessment:** Design portfolio including investigation findings, annotated design with specifications, making log, test results, and evaluative conclusion comparing outcome to original brief.

**Teacher note:** Use the DESIGN, MAKE AND EVALUATE template: show children existing products and help them say what they like and how they work. Support them in drawing and talking about their own design idea. Help them choose materials and make their product with adult support. Encourage them to try it out and say what worked and what they might change.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What do you like about this product? How does it work?
- Can you draw what you want to make?
- What materials will you use? Why?
- Does your product work? What would you change?

## Design and Technology: Mechanisms

**Design brief:** Design and make a wheeled vehicle that can roll at least 1 metre when pushed on a smooth floor. The vehicle must have at least 4 wheels and a body that can carry a small cargo.

**Materials:** card, wooden dowel, wheels (pre-made or card circles), straws, tape, boxes
**Tools:** scissors, hole punch, ruler, glue gun (adult use only)
**Techniques:** axle fitting, chassis construction, wheel attachment, body construction
**Safety notes:** Adult use only for glue gun. Ensure axle holes are punched by adult if card is thick. Wooden dowels should be pre-cut to length. Test vehicles on a flat surface only -- not tables where they could fall.

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Does the vehicle roll smoothly?
- Does it travel at least 1 metre?
- Can it carry a small cargo?
- Do all wheels touch the ground?

## Why this study matters

Making a wheeled vehicle combines structures (the chassis must be rigid) with mechanisms (wheels must rotate freely on axles). The clear success criterion -- does it roll? -- gives immediate feedback. Pupils discover that axle placement, wheel alignment, and chassis rigidity all affect whether the vehicle works. This is problem-solving through making.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Wheels attached too tightly to spin freely -- axles must rotate in chassis holes
2. Chassis not rigid enough -- wobbles and wheels drag
3. Wheels different sizes -- vehicle pulls to one side; teach the importance of matched pairs
