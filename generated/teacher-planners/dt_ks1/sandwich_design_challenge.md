## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Healthy and Varied Diet (DT-KS1-C006)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

A healthy diet consists of a variety of foods from different food groups in appropriate proportions, providing the nutrients needed for growth, energy and good health. At KS1, pupils learn the basic principles of a healthy and varied diet, developing awareness that no single food provides everything the body needs, and that variety and balance are key to nutrition.

**Teaching guidance:** Use visual tools such as the Eatwell Guide to introduce food groups. Explore a wide variety of foods through tasting, sorting and classification activities. Discuss how different foods give us energy, help us grow and keep us healthy. Make simple dishes that combine foods from different groups. Connect food preparation to the wider design and technology curriculum through the design-make-evaluate cycle applied to food products.

**Key vocabulary:** healthy, varied, diet, nutrition, food group, balance, protein, carbohydrate, fruit, vegetable, dairy, fat, sugar, portion, ingredient

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may have the misconception that certain foods are entirely 'bad' or 'good'. Teaching that balance and variety are more important than restriction is age-appropriate. Pupils may not connect the food they eat to where it comes from; building this understanding supports both nutrition and science learning.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Naming some foods from different food groups and understanding that eating different types of food keeps us healthy. | Sort these foods into groups: apple, bread, chicken, butter, carrot. Which group helps us grow? | Not recognising that a carrot is a vegetable, not a fruit; Thinking one food group is 'bad' rather than needed in smaller amounts |
| **Developing** | Explaining why a varied diet is important and giving examples of meals that include foods from several groups. | Plan a lunch that includes foods from at least three food groups. Explain why variety matters. | Planning a meal from only one food group; Describing foods as 'healthy' or 'unhealthy' in absolute terms rather than discussing balance |
| **Expected** | Using the Eatwell Guide to plan balanced meals and explaining what different nutrients do for the body. | Using the Eatwell Guide, plan a balanced day of meals. Explain how each food group contributes to health. | Not understanding the proportions shown on the Eatwell Guide; Confusing what different nutrients do (e.g. thinking protein gives energy) |

> **Model response (Entry):** *Fruits: apple, carrot. Bread and cereals: bread. Meat: chicken. Fats: butter. Chicken helps us grow because it has protein.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Sandwich with bread (grains), chicken (protein) and lettuce (vegetable), plus an apple (fruit) and milk (dairy). Variety matters because no single food has everything our body needs — we need different nutrients from different foods to stay healthy and have energy.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Breakfast: porridge (carbohydrates for energy) with berries (vitamins). Lunch: jacket potato (carbs) with beans (protein for growth) and cheese (calcium for bones). Dinner: rice with fish (protein and healthy fats) and vegetables (fibre and vitamins). The Eatwell Guide shows the biggest section should be starchy foods and fruit/veg, with smaller portions of protein and dairy.*

### Secondary concept: Design Criteria (DT-KS1-C002)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Design criteria are the specific requirements that a product must meet to be considered successful. They define what the product must do (function), who it is for (user), how it should look (aesthetics) and sometimes what it should be made of (materials). At KS1, pupils are introduced to design criteria as a way of setting goals before making and checking success after making.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Stating who a product is for and one thing it must do, with adult prompts. | Giving vague criteria like 'it must be good' or 'it must be nice'; Not identifying a user for the product |
| **Developing** | Generating two or three simple, checkable design criteria that address function and user needs. | Writing criteria that cannot be tested or checked; Focusing only on aesthetics without addressing function |
| **Expected** | Creating design criteria independently that address function, aesthetics and user needs, then using them to evaluate the finished product. | Writing criteria after making rather than before; Not checking each criterion individually during evaluation |

### Secondary concept: Product Analysis and Evaluation (DT-KS1-C010)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Product analysis involves examining an existing product to understand its purpose, how it works, what it is made from and how well it achieves its intended function. At KS1, pupils develop the habit of looking critically at products, both those made by others and those they have made themselves, asking structured questions about purpose, materials, function and user. Evaluation against design criteria develops the principle that a product's success can be measured objectively rather than assessed through preference alone.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Looking at a product and saying what they like or do not like about it, using simple language. | Giving only a personal preference without any reasoning; Not being able to articulate what makes the product effective |
| **Developing** | Analysing a product by considering its purpose, materials, user and how well it works, using guided questions. | Evaluating only the appearance and not the function; Not considering the user's needs when analysing the product |
| **Expected** | Evaluating their own product and products made by others against design criteria, identifying strengths, weaknesses and specific improvements. | Saying everything is perfect without identifying genuine areas for improvement; Suggesting improvements that are unrelated to the design criteria |

---

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Setting design criteria requires pupils to articulate what the product must do (function) and how it must be structured to achieve that — the criteria themselves encode structure-function reasoning about the intended product.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What shape is it? Why do you think it is that shape?
- What job does this part do?
- What would happen if this part were a different shape?
- Can you find something else that does the same job?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Evaluating whether a design idea meets criteria is a claim-and-evidence act: pupils must justify design decisions by arguing that a particular choice satisfies the stated criteria for the intended user.

---

## Session structure: Design, Make, Evaluate

### Design, Make, Evaluate
The core Design & Technology cycle. Pupils investigate existing products and user needs, design a solution with clear specifications, plan the making process, construct using appropriate materials and techniques, test against the design brief, and evaluate the outcome with suggestions for improvement.

`investigate` → `design` → `plan` → `make` → `test` → `evaluate`

**Assessment:** Design portfolio including investigation findings, annotated design with specifications, making log, test results, and evaluative conclusion comparing outcome to original brief.

**Teacher note:** Use the DESIGN, MAKE AND EVALUATE template: show children existing products and help them say what they like and how they work. Support them in drawing and talking about their own design idea. Help them choose materials and make their product with adult support. Encourage them to try it out and say what worked and what they might change.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What do you like about this product? How does it work?
- Can you draw what you want to make?
- What materials will you use? Why?
- Does your product work? What would you change?

## Design and Technology: Cooking And Nutrition

**Design brief:** Design and make a healthy sandwich for a specific person. Find out what they like to eat. Choose fillings that are tasty AND healthy.

**Materials:** bread (including wholemeal), butter/spread, various sandwich fillings (cheese, ham, cucumber, tomato, lettuce), wraps (alternative to bread)
**Tools:** chopping boards, child-safe knives, plates, butter knives
**Techniques:** spreading, chopping fillings, assembling layers, cutting in half
**Safety notes:** Check for allergies (gluten, dairy, nuts) before the session. All surfaces cleaned before food preparation. Hands washed before handling food. Child-safe knives only. Ensure fillings requiring refrigeration are kept cold until use.

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Does the sandwich contain at least two healthy fillings?
- Did the user enjoy it?
- Is it neatly assembled?
**Food allergens:** gluten (bread), dairy (butter, cheese), possible: nuts (check all fillings)
**Food skills:** spreading, chopping, assembling, food hygiene

---

## Why this study matters

Designing a sandwich for a specific person (a teacher, a friend, a character from a book) introduces user-centred design through food. Pupils must research their user's preferences, select ingredients that are both tasty and healthy, assemble the sandwich, and evaluate whether the user likes it. The design-make-evaluate cycle is immediately tangible.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Not connecting to the design criteria -- 'Does your user like these ingredients?'
2. Hygiene forgotten in the excitement of making -- establish hand washing as the first step every time
3. Bread cutting skills uneven -- pre-slice bread or provide sliced bread
