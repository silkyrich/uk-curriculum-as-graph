## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Healthy and Varied Diet (DT-KS1-C006)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

A healthy diet consists of a variety of foods from different food groups in appropriate proportions, providing the nutrients needed for growth, energy and good health. At KS1, pupils learn the basic principles of a healthy and varied diet, developing awareness that no single food provides everything the body needs, and that variety and balance are key to nutrition.

**Teaching guidance:** Use visual tools such as the Eatwell Guide to introduce food groups. Explore a wide variety of foods through tasting, sorting and classification activities. Discuss how different foods give us energy, help us grow and keep us healthy. Make simple dishes that combine foods from different groups. Connect food preparation to the wider design and technology curriculum through the design-make-evaluate cycle applied to food products.

**Key vocabulary:** healthy, varied, diet, nutrition, food group, balance, protein, carbohydrate, fruit, vegetable, dairy, fat, sugar, portion, ingredient

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may have the misconception that certain foods are entirely 'bad' or 'good'. Teaching that balance and variety are more important than restriction is age-appropriate. Pupils may not connect the food they eat to where it comes from; building this understanding supports both nutrition and science learning.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Naming some foods from different food groups and understanding that eating different types of food keeps us healthy. | Sort these foods into groups: apple, bread, chicken, butter, carrot. Which group helps us grow? | Not recognising that a carrot is a vegetable, not a fruit; Thinking one food group is 'bad' rather than needed in smaller amounts |
| **Developing** | Explaining why a varied diet is important and giving examples of meals that include foods from several groups. | Plan a lunch that includes foods from at least three food groups. Explain why variety matters. | Planning a meal from only one food group; Describing foods as 'healthy' or 'unhealthy' in absolute terms rather than discussing balance |
| **Expected** | Using the Eatwell Guide to plan balanced meals and explaining what different nutrients do for the body. | Using the Eatwell Guide, plan a balanced day of meals. Explain how each food group contributes to health. | Not understanding the proportions shown on the Eatwell Guide; Confusing what different nutrients do (e.g. thinking protein gives energy) |

> **Model response (Entry):** *Fruits: apple, carrot. Bread and cereals: bread. Meat: chicken. Fats: butter. Chicken helps us grow because it has protein.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Sandwich with bread (grains), chicken (protein) and lettuce (vegetable), plus an apple (fruit) and milk (dairy). Variety matters because no single food has everything our body needs — we need different nutrients from different foods to stay healthy and have energy.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *Breakfast: porridge (carbohydrates for energy) with berries (vitamins). Lunch: jacket potato (carbs) with beans (protein for growth) and cheese (calcium for bones). Dinner: rice with fish (protein and healthy fats) and vegetables (fibre and vitamins). The Eatwell Guide shows the biggest section should be starchy foods and fruit/veg, with smaller portions of protein and dairy.*

### Secondary concept: Where Food Comes From (DT-KS1-C007)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Food comes from a variety of sources including plants, animals and the sea. Understanding the origins of food connects pupils to the natural world and to the agricultural and industrial processes by which food is grown, raised, caught and processed before reaching shops and kitchens. At KS1, pupils develop foundational awareness of the food chain and the journey food makes from farm to plate.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying whether common foods come from plants or animals. | Not knowing that bread comes from wheat (a plant); Thinking cheese comes from a plant because it doesn't look like it came from an animal |
| **Developing** | Describing the journey of a food from its source to the plate, identifying at least two stages. | Thinking milk comes directly from the shop without any processing; Not knowing that pasteurisation is a necessary step for safety |
| **Expected** | Explaining that food production involves farming, processing and transport, and beginning to understand seasonality — that some foods grow at certain times of year. | Thinking all food in shops is grown locally; Not connecting food miles and seasonality to environmental impact |

## Thinking lens: Systems and System Models (primary)

**Key question:** What are the parts of this system, how do they interact, and what happens when something changes?

**Why this lens fits:** The concept of a healthy and varied diet requires pupils to model the body as a system with different nutritional needs — understanding that the diet as a whole must provide a balance of inputs (food types) to keep the system functioning well.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What are all the parts of this?
- How do these parts work together?
- What would happen if this part was missing?
- Can you draw a picture showing how it works?

**Secondary lens:** Cause and Effect — Food origins provides a causal chain linking farming practices and environmental conditions to the food that arrives on the plate — pupils trace the pathway from source to consumer, understanding how decisions at each stage affect food quality.

## Session structure: Design, Make, Evaluate

### Design, Make, Evaluate
The core Design & Technology cycle. Pupils investigate existing products and user needs, design a solution with clear specifications, plan the making process, construct using appropriate materials and techniques, test against the design brief, and evaluate the outcome with suggestions for improvement.

`investigate` → `design` → `plan` → `make` → `test` → `evaluate`

**Assessment:** Design portfolio including investigation findings, annotated design with specifications, making log, test results, and evaluative conclusion comparing outcome to original brief.

**Teacher note:** Use the DESIGN, MAKE AND EVALUATE template: show children existing products and help them say what they like and how they work. Support them in drawing and talking about their own design idea. Help them choose materials and make their product with adult support. Encourage them to try it out and say what worked and what they might change.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What do you like about this product? How does it work?
- Can you draw what you want to make?
- What materials will you use? Why?
- Does your product work? What would you change?

## Design and Technology: Cooking And Nutrition

**Design brief:** Design and make a fruit salad for a class picnic. Choose at least 4 different fruits. Think about colour, taste, and healthy eating.

**Materials:** assorted fresh fruits (apples, bananas, oranges, grapes, strawberries, kiwi), lemon juice, bowls
**Tools:** chopping boards, child-safe knives, bowls, spoons, peelers (adult use)
**Techniques:** washing, peeling, chopping, mixing, arranging
**Safety notes:** Check for allergies before selecting fruits (kiwi and strawberry are common childhood allergens). Wash all fruits. Adult supervision for any cutting. Wash hands before handling food. Use child-safe knives with rounded ends. Peelers to be used by adults only at KS1.

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Does the fruit salad contain at least 4 different fruits?
- Is it colourful and appealing?
- Does it taste good?
**Food allergens:** possible: kiwi, possible: strawberry
**Food skills:** washing, peeling (with support), safe cutting with child-safe knife, mixing

## Why this study matters

A fruit salad is the ideal first cooking project: no heat is involved (removing a major safety concern), the ingredients are colourful and appealing, and the preparation techniques (washing, peeling, cutting, arranging) are age-appropriate. The project naturally teaches healthy eating, food groups, and where different fruits come from.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Not checking allergies beforehand -- survey families at least a week before
2. Knives too sharp for the age group -- use child-safe serrated knives that cut fruit but not fingers
3. All pupils making identical salads -- let them choose which fruits to include based on taste preferences
