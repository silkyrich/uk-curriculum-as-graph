## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **1 secondary concept**.

### Primary concept: Mechanisms: Levers, Sliders, Wheels and Axles (DT-KS1-C005)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Mechanisms are devices that transmit and modify motion and force. At KS1, pupils explore simple mechanisms including levers, sliders, wheels and axles, learning how these can be used to create movement in their products. Pupils investigate how levers pivot around a fulcrum, how sliders create linear movement, and how wheels turning on axles enable rolling. This concept introduces the principle that mechanical systems convert one type of input into useful output.

**Teaching guidance:** Provide ready-made mechanical components such as split pins, card strips and wheels for exploring levers and pivots. Make simple moving pictures using levers and sliders that create movement when a card is pulled. Attach wheels to simple vehicles and investigate how the diameter of wheels affects how far they travel. Examine real products that use these mechanisms. Encourage pupils to describe the movement they observe using appropriate vocabulary.

**Key vocabulary:** mechanism, lever, slider, wheel, axle, pivot, fulcrum, rotate, linear, movement, force, input, output, motion

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils may confuse wheels (which rotate) with rollers or may not understand the function of an axle in keeping a wheel spinning. Practical investigation with real mechanisms is more effective than diagrammatic explanation at this stage. Pupils may not recognise that levers are found in everyday objects such as scissors, seesaws and door handles.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Creating a simple moving mechanism (lever or slider) with adult support, observing that pushing or pulling creates movement. | Use a split pin to attach this card arm to the body. Push the arm — what happens? | Fixing the split pin too tightly so the mechanism cannot move; Not understanding that the split pin is the pivot point |
| **Developing** | Incorporating a mechanism (lever, slider or wheel and axle) into a product to create intentional movement. | Make a moving picture where a character waves their arm using a lever mechanism. | Creating movement that doesn't relate to the product's purpose; Making the mechanism visible from the front when it should be hidden |
| **Expected** | Choosing and combining appropriate mechanisms for a design brief, explaining how the mechanism works and why they selected it. | Design a card with a moving part for a younger child. Choose the best mechanism and explain your choice. | Choosing a mechanism without considering the user or the intended movement; Not being able to explain how the mechanism converts the input motion to the output |

> **Model response (Entry):** *When I push the arm it moves around the split pin. The split pin is in the middle and the arm swings up and down.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *I cut out a character and a separate arm. I attached the arm with a split pin at the shoulder. I added a card strip at the back so I can push it from behind to make the arm wave.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *I chose a slider mechanism because it is simple and safe for a small child to use — they just pull a tab. I made a fish that slides across a sea scene. The slider is a card strip that moves through two slots. I chose this instead of a lever because the sliding movement looks like swimming, which matches the fish design.*

### Secondary concept: Structures and Stability (DT-KS1-C004)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Structures are physical constructions that support loads or maintain a form. At KS1, pupils explore how structures can be made stronger, stiffer and more stable through practical building activities. They investigate how the shape of a structure, the way it is joined and the materials it is made from all affect its strength and stability. This concept introduces foundational engineering principles through hands-on investigation.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Building a simple freestanding structure from given materials, exploring how to stop it falling over. | Building a tall, narrow structure that immediately falls over; Using excessive tape or glue instead of thinking about the structure's shape |
| **Developing** | Explaining why some structures are stronger than others and using shapes like triangles to add strength. | Believing thicker material is always stronger, without considering shape; Not understanding why folding or triangulating makes structures stronger |
| **Expected** | Designing and building a structure that meets a specific brief, explaining how the shape, materials and joining methods contribute to its strength and stability. | Building without considering load-bearing requirements; Not being able to explain why their design choices contribute to strength |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Understanding material characteristics is fundamentally about how the internal structure of a material (its texture, rigidity, flexibility) determines what it can be used for — a foundational structure-function relationship.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What shape is it? Why do you think it is that shape?
- What job does this part do?
- What would happen if this part were a different shape?
- Can you find something else that does the same job?

**Secondary lens:** Patterns — Pupils learn to group materials by shared properties (all rigid materials behave similarly when cut; all fabrics can be joined with thread), building pattern recognition that supports generalisation across new materials.

## Session structure: Design, Make, Evaluate

### Design, Make, Evaluate
The core Design & Technology cycle. Pupils investigate existing products and user needs, design a solution with clear specifications, plan the making process, construct using appropriate materials and techniques, test against the design brief, and evaluate the outcome with suggestions for improvement.

`investigate` → `design` → `plan` → `make` → `test` → `evaluate`

**Assessment:** Design portfolio including investigation findings, annotated design with specifications, making log, test results, and evaluative conclusion comparing outcome to original brief.

**Teacher note:** Use the DESIGN, MAKE AND EVALUATE template: show children existing products and help them say what they like and how they work. Support them in drawing and talking about their own design idea. Help them choose materials and make their product with adult support. Encourage them to try it out and say what worked and what they might change.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What do you like about this product? How does it work?
- Can you draw what you want to make?
- What materials will you use? Why?
- Does your product work? What would you change?

## Design and Technology: Mechanisms

**Design brief:** Design and make a windmill with sails that spin in the wind. The windmill must stand up on its own and the sails must turn when you blow on them.

**Materials:** card, paper, straws, split pins, wooden sticks, tape
**Tools:** scissors, ruler, hole punch
**Techniques:** folding sails, pinning through centre, tower construction, axle fitting
**Safety notes:** Split pin points must be flattened. Adult supervision for hole punch. If using wooden sticks for axles, ensure ends are smooth (no splinters). Test spinning mechanism is secure before use.

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Do the sails spin in the wind?
- Does the windmill stand without support?
- Is the mechanism secure?

## Why this study matters

A paper windmill combines structures (the tower must stand) with mechanisms (the sails must spin). It introduces rotational movement created by wind -- a natural connection to science (forces, wind). The construction requires precise folding and pinning, developing fine motor skills and sequencing ability.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Pin poked through too tightly -- sail cannot spin; leave slight gap
2. Tower too flimsy to hold the sail assembly -- reinforce with card tubes
3. Not testing outside -- windmills need wind; test near an open window or use a fan
