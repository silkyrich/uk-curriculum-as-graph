## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **2 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Structures and Stability (DT-KS1-C004)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Structures are physical constructions that support loads or maintain a form. At KS1, pupils explore how structures can be made stronger, stiffer and more stable through practical building activities. They investigate how the shape of a structure, the way it is joined and the materials it is made from all affect its strength and stability. This concept introduces foundational engineering principles through hands-on investigation.

**Teaching guidance:** Set building challenges using reclaimed materials, construction kits and card. Investigate how tubes, triangles and other shapes resist bending. Explore different joining methods including adhesives, tape, folding tabs and fasteners. Challenge pupils to make a structure that can support a specific load - a bridge that holds toy cars, a tower that holds a book. Use questions to prompt investigation: 'What happens if you make the legs wider?', 'Which shape is stronger - a square or a triangle?'

**Key vocabulary:** structure, strong, stable, stiff, rigid, weak, collapse, support, load, base, joint, brace, triangle, beam

**Common misconceptions:** Pupils often attribute strength to the amount of material used rather than to structure and shape. Demonstrating that a triangulated structure is stronger than a square one with the same materials addresses this. Some pupils may not understand that stability is about balance and the distribution of weight as well as strength of materials.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Building a simple freestanding structure from given materials, exploring how to stop it falling over. | Use these cardboard tubes and tape to build a tower that stands up on its own. | Building a tall, narrow structure that immediately falls over; Using excessive tape or glue instead of thinking about the structure's shape |
| **Developing** | Explaining why some structures are stronger than others and using shapes like triangles to add strength. | Make a bridge from paper that can hold a toy car. How can you make the paper stronger? | Believing thicker material is always stronger, without considering shape; Not understanding why folding or triangulating makes structures stronger |
| **Expected** | Designing and building a structure that meets a specific brief, explaining how the shape, materials and joining methods contribute to its strength and stability. | Design and build a shelter for a toy animal that is at least 15cm tall and can support a book placed on top. | Building without considering load-bearing requirements; Not being able to explain why their design choices contribute to strength |

> **Model response (Entry):** *I stood three tubes up and taped them together. Then I spread them out at the bottom so it didn't wobble.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *I folded the paper into a zigzag shape, like a concertina. This made it much stiffer than a flat piece of paper. The folds act like little walls that stop the paper bending.*

> **Model response (Expected):** *I made four corner pillars from rolled newspaper tubes because tubes are stronger than flat paper. I used triangular braces between the pillars to stop them leaning. The roof is corrugated card for stiffness. It is 18cm tall and held the book. The triangles and tubes make it strong even though the materials are light.*

### Secondary concept: Materials and Their Characteristics (DT-KS1-C003)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Different materials have different physical properties that make them suitable for different purposes. At KS1, pupils learn to identify and describe the properties of a range of materials including construction materials such as card, wood and plastic, textiles and food ingredients, and to make informed choices about which material to use based on what the product needs to do.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Identifying different materials by name (card, fabric, wood, plastic) and describing one property of each. | Not knowing the names of common materials; Describing only how materials look, not how they feel or behave |
| **Developing** | Choosing a material for a specific purpose and explaining why it is suitable based on its properties. | Choosing materials based on colour preference rather than functional properties; Not being able to explain why a material is or isn't suitable |
| **Expected** | Comparing materials systematically and selecting the most appropriate one by weighing up multiple properties against design criteria. | Considering only one property instead of weighing up several; Not recognising that the 'best' material depends on the specific requirements |

### Secondary concept: Product Analysis and Evaluation (DT-KS1-C010)

**Type:** Process | **Teaching weight:** 1/6

Product analysis involves examining an existing product to understand its purpose, how it works, what it is made from and how well it achieves its intended function. At KS1, pupils develop the habit of looking critically at products, both those made by others and those they have made themselves, asking structured questions about purpose, materials, function and user. Evaluation against design criteria develops the principle that a product's success can be measured objectively rather than assessed through preference alone.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Entry** | Looking at a product and saying what they like or do not like about it, using simple language. | Giving only a personal preference without any reasoning; Not being able to articulate what makes the product effective |
| **Developing** | Analysing a product by considering its purpose, materials, user and how well it works, using guided questions. | Evaluating only the appearance and not the function; Not considering the user's needs when analysing the product |
| **Expected** | Evaluating their own product and products made by others against design criteria, identifying strengths, weaknesses and specific improvements. | Saying everything is perfect without identifying genuine areas for improvement; Suggesting improvements that are unrelated to the design criteria |

## Thinking lens: Structure and Function (primary)

**Key question:** How does the structure of this thing enable or explain what it does?

**Why this lens fits:** Investigating existing products involves disassembly thinking: pupils examine how the structure and materials of an existing product enable it to perform its function, making structure-function reasoning the primary analytical tool.

**Question stems for KS1:**
- What shape is it? Why do you think it is that shape?
- What job does this part do?
- What would happen if this part were a different shape?
- Can you find something else that does the same job?

**Secondary lens:** Evidence and Argument — Evaluating whether a product meets its design criteria requires pupils to form a judgement supported by evidence from investigation or testing — the evaluative act is a structured argument from evidence to conclusion.

## Session structure: Design, Make, Evaluate

### Design, Make, Evaluate
The core Design & Technology cycle. Pupils investigate existing products and user needs, design a solution with clear specifications, plan the making process, construct using appropriate materials and techniques, test against the design brief, and evaluate the outcome with suggestions for improvement.

`investigate` → `design` → `plan` → `make` → `test` → `evaluate`

**Assessment:** Design portfolio including investigation findings, annotated design with specifications, making log, test results, and evaluative conclusion comparing outcome to original brief.

**Teacher note:** Use the DESIGN, MAKE AND EVALUATE template: show children existing products and help them say what they like and how they work. Support them in drawing and talking about their own design idea. Help them choose materials and make their product with adult support. Encourage them to try it out and say what worked and what they might change.

**KS1 question stems:**
- What do you like about this product? How does it work?
- Can you draw what you want to make?
- What materials will you use? Why?
- Does your product work? What would you change?

## Design and Technology: Structures

**Design brief:** Design and build a freestanding tower using card, paper, and tape. The tower must be at least 30cm tall and strong enough to hold a small toy on top.

**Materials:** card, paper, tape, straws, newspaper
**Tools:** scissors, ruler, pencil
**Techniques:** folding for strength, tube rolling, triangulation, base widening, tab joining
**Safety notes:** Ensure stable work surfaces. If using newspaper tubes, supervise rolling to avoid paper cuts. All scissors should be child-safe rounded-end type.

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Does the tower stand without support?
- Is it at least 30cm tall?
- Can it hold a small toy on top?
- What makes it strong?

---

## Why this study matters

Building a structure that stands up without support is a fundamental engineering challenge. Pupils discover through trial and error that a wide base is more stable, that triangles are stronger than squares, and that rolling paper into tubes makes it stiffer. The process of testing and improving teaches the iterative design cycle through direct physical feedback -- it stands or it falls.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Building too tall too quickly -- the structure collapses before joints dry
2. Using only glue for joints -- teach folding tabs and slotting as structural joins
3. Not testing with a load -- a structure that stands is not the same as one that holds something
