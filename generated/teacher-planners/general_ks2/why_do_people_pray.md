## Session structure: Comparison Study

### Comparison Study
A structured comparison of two or more examples, places, periods, or perspectives. Introduces each example with sufficient context, applies a systematic comparison framework, analyses similarities and differences with supporting evidence, and reaches an evaluative conclusion about the significance of those differences.

`introduce_examples` → `systematic_comparison` → `analysis` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Comparative analysis using a structured framework (table, Venn diagram, or essay), demonstrating understanding of both examples and reaching a substantiated evaluative conclusion.

**Teacher note:** Use the COMPARISON STUDY template: introduce two clear examples — places, periods, beliefs, or phenomena — with enough detail for pupils to identify similarities and differences. Guide systematic comparison using a table or Venn diagram. Prompt pupils to explain why there are similarities or differences, not just list them.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What is the same about these two examples?
- What is different, and why might that be?
- Which similarity or difference is the most important? Why?
- Can you organise your comparisons in a table or diagram?

## Why this study matters

Prayer is a practice common to most religions but expressed in radically different ways. Comparing Christian prayer (individual, communal, Lord's Prayer), Islamic salah (five daily prayers with ritual washing and specific movements), and Hindu puja (worship with images, incense, and offerings) teaches that the same human impulse (communicating with the divine) produces diverse practices shaped by different beliefs.

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Presenting prayer as just 'talking to God' -- many prayer traditions involve specific bodily practices
2. Only covering Christian prayer -- the comparison is the learning
3. Making children pray -- RS teaches about prayer, it does not require participation
