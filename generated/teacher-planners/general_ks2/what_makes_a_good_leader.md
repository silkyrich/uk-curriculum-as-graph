## Session structure: Comparison Study

### Comparison Study
A structured comparison of two or more examples, places, periods, or perspectives. Introduces each example with sufficient context, applies a systematic comparison framework, analyses similarities and differences with supporting evidence, and reaches an evaluative conclusion about the significance of those differences.

`introduce_examples` → `systematic_comparison` → `analysis` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Comparative analysis using a structured framework (table, Venn diagram, or essay), demonstrating understanding of both examples and reaching a substantiated evaluative conclusion.

**Teacher note:** Use the COMPARISON STUDY template: introduce two clear examples — places, periods, beliefs, or phenomena — with enough detail for pupils to identify similarities and differences. Guide systematic comparison using a table or Venn diagram. Prompt pupils to explain why there are similarities or differences, not just list them.

**KS2 question stems:**
- What is the same about these two examples?
- What is different, and why might that be?
- Which similarity or difference is the most important? Why?
- Can you organise your comparisons in a table or diagram?

## Why this study matters

Studying religious leaders (Jesus, Muhammad, Guru Nanak, the Buddha, Moses) through the lens of leadership teaches both theological content and ethical reasoning. Pupils compare what makes a good leader across traditions: compassion, justice, courage, wisdom. This connects to PSHE (leadership in school) and History (historical leaders).

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Treating religious figures as historical characters only -- they are objects of devotion for believers
2. Ranking leaders as 'best' -- the comparison should highlight different qualities, not create a hierarchy
3. Only covering male leaders -- include Miriam, Khadijah, Mirabai where appropriate

| Example correct feedback | *You recognised that 1/2 is larger than 2/5, and used the common denominator method correctly. The visualiser confirms it — the bar for 1/2 is noticeably longer.* |
| Example error feedback | *The reasoning does not quite hold: you said both fractions are the same because the numerator in 2/5 is double the numerator in 1/2. But the denominator changed too — the pieces got smaller. Converting to tenths: 1/2 = 5/10 and 2/5 = 4/10. Which is larger now?* |
