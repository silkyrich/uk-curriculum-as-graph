## Enquiry questions

1. Has Britain always been a nation of immigrants?
2. Why have attitudes towards migrants shifted between welcome and hostility across 1,200 years?
3. How far have the experiences of migrants in Britain been shaped by their country of origin?
4. Is the story of migration in Britain one of integration, assimilation, or ongoing difference?

## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Migrants in Britain c800-present (HI-KS4-C015)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

A thematic study tracing the history of migration to and from Britain across more than a millennium, examining the push and pull factors driving migration, the varied experiences of migrants, the responses of host communities, and the contribution of migrants to British society.

**Teaching guidance:** Organise teaching around distinct waves of migration: Viking and Norman settlement; Jewish communities in medieval and early modern Britain; Huguenot refugees; the slave trade and early black British communities; Irish migration; Empire Windrush and post-war Commonwealth migration; recent European migration. For each wave, apply the same analytical framework: who migrated, why, how were they received, what was their experience, and what contribution did they make? Teach students to assess change and continuity in attitudes to migration across the period, and to evaluate interpretations of whether Britain has historically been a welcoming or hostile host society. The historic environment component (Notting Hill c1948-1970) should connect the thematic narrative to specific local evidence of post-war migration.

**Key vocabulary:** migration, emigration, immigration, refugee, asylum seeker, push factor, pull factor, integration, discrimination, multiculturalism, diaspora, Windrush, Commonwealth, Huguenot, pogrom, assimilation, host community

**Common misconceptions:** Students often present British history of migration as beginning in the 20th century, overlooking the long history of migration that shaped Britain from the medieval period onwards. Students sometimes treat all migrant experiences as uniform rather than recognising enormous variation by period, origin, class, and individual circumstance. Students frequently conflate political and legal attitudes to migration with the lived experience of migrants in local communities.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify that people have migrated to Britain throughout history but has limited knowledge of specific groups, periods or the reasons for migration. | Give one example of a group of people who migrated to Britain. | Knowing only about post-WWII migration and not recognising the long history of migration to Britain; Not explaining why the migration occurred or what happened to the migrants |
| **Developing** | Can describe several waves of migration to Britain with specific detail and explain push-pull factors for each, with some awareness of how migrants were received. | Explain why Huguenots migrated to Britain in the late 17th century and what impact they had. (4 marks) | Describing migration without explaining the specific push and pull factors; Not considering the reception migrants received from host communities |
| **Secure** | Can construct sustained analytical arguments about change and continuity in British migration history, comparing different waves of migration and evaluating patterns in attitudes towards migrants. | To what extent have attitudes towards migrants in Britain changed between c800 and the present? (16 marks) | Presenting either a narrative of increasing tolerance or a narrative of persistent hostility, without recognising both patterns; Not comparing attitudes across different periods systematically |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate competing interpretations of British migration history, critically assess the relationship between migration history and contemporary political debates, and integrate the historic environment component into a broader analytical argument. | How does a study of Notting Hill (c1948-1970) help us understand both the experience of Caribbean migrants and the broader patterns of British migration history? | Describing Notting Hill's features without explicitly connecting them to the broader themes of the migration thematic study; Treating the historic environment as a separate component rather than integrating it analytically into the thematic argument |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *People came from the Caribbean on the Windrush in 1948 to work in Britain after the war.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Huguenots were French Protestants who migrated to Britain after 1685 when King Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes, which had given Protestants religious freedom in France. They faced persecution, imprisonment and forced conversion. Britain was a pull factor because it was a Protestant country that offered relative religious tolerance. About 50,000 Huguenots settled in England, many in London's Spitalfields area where they established the silk weaving industry. They contributed skills in textiles, silversmithing, banking and other trades, enriching the English economy and culture.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Attitudes towards migrants in Britain show both significant change and striking continuity across over a millennium. The pattern of initial hostility followed by gradual integration recurs across multiple waves of migration. Viking settlers (9th-10th centuries) were initially violent invaders, but the Danelaw shows that Norse settlers became integrated into English society over generations. Jewish communities welcomed by William I in 1066 faced increasing persecution culminating in the expulsion of 1290, a cycle of welcome, usefulness and eventual rejection that has parallels with later experiences. Huguenot migrants (1680s-1700s) faced initial resentment from local workers who feared economic competition, but within a generation were recognised for their economic contribution. Caribbean migrants who arrived on the Windrush and after (1948 onwards) faced racial discrimination despite having been actively recruited to address labour shortages, as evidenced by the 1958 Notting Hill race riots and the discriminatory housing market. The continuity across these examples is that migration has consistently been driven by push factors (persecution, poverty, conflict) and pull factors (economic opportunity, safety), and that host community reactions have consistently mixed economic pragmatism with cultural anxiety about newcomers. The changes are also significant: the scale of migration has increased; the legal framework governing immigration has become more formalised; and the development of anti-discrimination legislation (Race Relations Acts of 1965, 1968, 1976) represents a genuine change in how the state addresses prejudice, even if prejudice itself has not been eliminated. The most important analytical point is that attitudes towards migration have never been uniform: at every stage, some Britons have welcomed migrants while others have opposed them, and the balance has depended on economic conditions, political leadership and the degree of perceived cultural difference.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Notting Hill provides a concentrated case study that illuminates both the specific experience of post-war Caribbean migration and the recurring patterns of British migration history. The physical environment itself is evidence: the large Victorian houses divided into multiple bedsits by exploitative landlords (most notoriously Peter Rachman) show how housing discrimination concentrated Caribbean migrants in poor-quality accommodation, creating visible concentrations that fuelled both community formation and racial tension. The 1958 race riots, in which white youths attacked Caribbean residents, demonstrate that racial hostility was not merely individual prejudice but could take organised, violent form — connecting to the broader historical pattern of violence against migrant communities (the 1190 York massacre of Jews; the 1919 race riots in Liverpool and Cardiff). The development of the Notting Hill Carnival (from 1966) shows the opposite dynamic: cultural expression by a migrant community becoming a celebrated part of British culture, paralleling the integration of Huguenot, Jewish and Irish cultural contributions in earlier periods. The historic environment of Notting Hill also illustrates how places change: the area transformed from a slum in the 1950s-60s to one of London's most expensive neighbourhoods, which raises questions about who benefits from urban regeneration and whether the community that built the area's cultural identity can afford to remain there. The Notting Hill case study connects to the thematic argument about migration by showing that the patterns observed across 1200 years — initial hostility, economic pragmatism, gradual cultural integration, and the tension between inclusion and exclusion — play out in specific, local, material ways that can be traced through physical spaces, community institutions and the built environment. The most historically productive approach uses the local case study to test and refine the broader analytical framework rather than merely illustrating it.*

### Secondary concept: Change and Continuity (HI-KS4-C003)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The analytical framework for assessing what changed and what remained constant across historical periods. Involves identifying the nature, pace, extent, and significance of change, and explaining what factors drove or prevented it.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can recognise that things changed over time but tends to describe change as total and sudden rather than analysing its nature, pace and extent alongside what remained constant. | Presenting change as a simple before-and-after contrast without explaining the process of change; Ignoring continuities by implying everything changed at once |
| **Developing** | Can identify specific changes and continuities within a historical period, explain some factors that drove or prevented change, and recognise that change was not uniform. | Identifying change and continuity without explaining the reasons behind them; Treating all change as equally important without assessing its significance |
| **Secure** | Can construct a sustained analytical argument about the nature, pace and extent of change across a historical period, identifying turning points and periods of stagnation and evaluating what drove or prevented change. | Identifying a turning point without evaluating how quickly change actually occurred in practice; Neglecting to discuss continuities alongside changes |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate the concept of turning points critically, argue about the relative significance of different drivers of change, and assess how the pace of change was shaped by the interaction of factors such as technology, ideas, individuals, government and war. | Asserting war was the most important factor without comparing it systematically with other factors across the full timespan; Not distinguishing between wartime innovations and their subsequent implementation in peacetime medicine |

### Secondary concept: Historical Significance (HI-KS4-C004)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

The criteria-based evaluation of why certain events, individuals, or developments matter historically. Significance is not inherent in events but is constructed by historians using explicit criteria relating to impact, scale, durability, and relevance to later developments.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can state that some events or people were important in history but cannot explain why using explicit criteria or historical reasoning. | Asserting that something was significant without explaining why; Using circular reasoning (significant because it was important) |
| **Developing** | Can explain why a historical event, person or development was significant using one or two criteria such as impact at the time or long-term legacy. | Explaining significance using only one criterion without considering others; Describing what the event was without assessing its importance relative to other developments |
| **Secure** | Can make substantiated significance judgements using multiple criteria, compare the significance of different events or developments, and recognise that significance can be assessed differently depending on perspective and timeframe. | Comparing significance without establishing and applying consistent criteria; Not recognising that the same development can have different levels of significance depending on the criteria and perspective used |
| **Mastery** | Can critically evaluate how and why historical significance is constructed, recognising that significance judgements are shaped by the historian's perspective, values and context, and can apply this understanding to analyse historiographical debates. | Treating historical significance as purely objective or purely subjective, rather than as constructed through criteria-based reasoning; Not connecting historiographical disagreement to the broader epistemological point about how historical knowledge is produced |

### Secondary concept: Historical Interpretations (HI-KS4-C006)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

The analysis and evaluation of historians' accounts and representations of the past, assessing how and why interpretations differ and how convincing each interpretation is given the available evidence (AO4).

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can recognise that historians sometimes disagree about the past but treats interpretations as opinions rather than evidence-based arguments that can be evaluated. | Treating historical interpretations as matters of personal opinion rather than reasoned arguments based on evidence; Agreeing or disagreeing based on personal preference rather than on analysis of the evidence and reasoning |
| **Developing** | Can identify how two interpretations differ and suggest reasons why historians might disagree, such as having different evidence or writing at different times. | Simply describing what each interpretation says without explaining why they differ; Assuming that disagreement means one interpretation must be wrong |
| **Secure** | Can evaluate the convincingness of a historical interpretation by assessing its argument, the evidence it uses, and the evidence it omits, while recognising the legitimate reasons why interpretations differ. | Saying 'I agree' or 'I disagree' without explaining why the interpretation is or is not convincing based on evidence; Not using own contextual knowledge to test the claims made in the interpretation |
| **Mastery** | Can analyse the historiographical context of competing interpretations, understanding how changes in evidence, methodology and perspective produce different historical accounts, and can construct an independent evaluative position. | Treating changing interpretations as simply 'getting better' rather than understanding the structural reasons why interpretations change; Not connecting historiographical change to broader shifts in society, politics and methodology |

### Secondary concept: Similarity and Difference (HI-KS4-C013)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The systematic comparison of historical situations, societies, or periods to identify what they shared and how they differed, as a tool for historical analysis and for evaluating historical generalisations.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify some similarities and differences between historical situations but lists them without analysis or a concluding judgement about the degree of similarity. | Listing surface-level similarities and differences without explaining their significance; Not drawing a conclusion about the overall degree of similarity or difference |
| **Developing** | Can identify and explain meaningful similarities and differences between historical situations with supporting detail, and begin to draw conclusions about the overall degree of similarity. | Identifying similarities and differences without explaining the reasons behind them; Not reaching an overall judgement about whether the situations were fundamentally similar or different |
| **Secure** | Can use similarity and difference as an analytical tool to construct historical arguments, distinguishing between surface-level similarities and fundamental structural differences. | Presenting settler and Indian experiences as equally difficult without recognising the structural asymmetry of the power relationship; Identifying surface-level similarities without analysing the fundamental differences in cause, context and power |
| **Mastery** | Can use comparative analysis to evaluate historical generalisations, challenge oversimplified characterisations, and develop nuanced arguments about the degree and significance of similarity and difference across historical contexts. | Accepting the generalisation uncritically or rejecting it entirely, rather than evaluating where it holds and where it breaks down; Making comparisons at only one level (structural) without considering ideological, economic and cultural differences |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Explaining why punishments changed (from public execution to rehabilitation) requires tracing the causal roles of Enlightenment philosophy, industrialisation, changing state capacity and shifting public attitudes — multi-factor causal reasoning applied across a long timespan.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- Is this a necessary cause, a sufficient cause, or a contributing factor?
- What confounding variables could explain this relationship?
- How would you design an investigation to establish causation, not just correlation?
- In this causal chain, where could an intervention have the most effect?

**Secondary lens:** Continuity and Change Over Time — Crime and punishment is a thematic study explicitly designed to train continuity_change analysis — pupils must identify which types of crime, which punishments, and which underlying attitudes have persisted across centuries versus changed dramatically, which requires systematic comparison across multiple time periods.

## Session structure: Topic Study + Source Enquiry

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Topic Study (main structure)
A structured enquiry into a defined topic, period, or place. Begins with an engaging hook to capture interest, builds contextual knowledge, moves through source analysis and interpretation, and culminates in a substantiated argument or conclusion. The core humanities template.

`hook` → `context` → `source_analysis` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Extended writing task presenting a reasoned argument supported by evidence from the topic. Can take the form of an essay, structured explanation, or debate position.

**Teacher note:** Use the TOPIC STUDY template: frame the session around a contested or historiographically significant question. Establish the scholarly context and competing interpretations. Guide pupils through critical source analysis with attention to provenance, purpose, and value. Expect a sustained, well-structured argument that evaluates competing claims and reaches a substantiated judgement.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does the provenance of this source affect its value for this enquiry?
- How would different historiographical perspectives interpret this evidence?
- What are the strengths and limitations of this argument?
- How would you construct a sustained response that evaluates competing interpretations?

### Source Enquiry
A disciplinary history enquiry centred on working with primary and secondary sources. Pupils select relevant sources, contextualise them within their historical period, interrogate them for reliability, utility, and bias, cross-reference between sources, interpret what they reveal, and construct an argument based on the evidence.

`source_selection` → `contextualisation` → `interrogation` → `cross_referencing` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Source-based extended writing that demonstrates ability to analyse provenance, cross-reference sources, reach substantiated interpretations, and construct a historical argument.

**Teacher note:** Use the SOURCE ENQUIRY template: present a diverse source base for an exam-standard historical enquiry. Expect rigorous analysis of provenance, purpose, and historical context for each source. Demand sophisticated cross-referencing that weighs sources against each other and against contextual knowledge. Guide the construction of a sustained argument that uses evidence precisely and addresses the question directly.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does the purpose and context of this source affect its value as evidence?
- How would you weigh this source against others to assess its reliability?
- What does this source reveal when read against the wider historical context?
- How would you construct an argument that deploys source evidence precisely and addresses counter-interpretations?

## Disciplinary concepts foregrounded

| Concept | Key question | Role in this study |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Change and Continuity | What changed, what stayed the same, and why? | At KS4, identify what has stayed constant about the migrant experience across 1,200 years and what has changed. Analyse why attitudes towards migrants shift cyclically. |
| Similarity and Difference | How was this similar to or different from other times, places, or peoples? | At KS4, compare migrant experiences across periods using consistent criteria: reasons for migration, reception, economic contribution, cultural integration, long-term impact. |
| Significance | Why does this matter, and to whom? | At KS4, evaluate the significance of specific migration events (e.g. Windrush): was it a turning point in British society, or one moment in a longer process? |
| Evidence and Interpretation | How do we know about this, and how do historians disagree? | At KS4, analyse primary sources from migrant communities (oral testimony, letters, legal records) and evaluate how historians have interpreted migration differently. |

## Key figures and events

**Key figures:** Viking settlers, Huguenots, Irish diaspora, Windrush generation, Ugandan Asian refugees

**Key events:**
- Viking settlement from c800
- Jewish expulsion 1290
- Huguenot arrival post-1685
- Irish famine migration 1840s
- Windrush 1948
- Ugandan Asian arrival 1972
- EU free movement 2004

**Period:** c800 - present

**Perspectives to include:** Viking settler, medieval Jewish merchant, Huguenot refugee, Irish labourer, Windrush passenger, local community receiving migrants

**Significance claim:** The history of migration reveals that Britain has always been shaped by the movement of peoples — and that attitudes towards migrants have oscillated between welcome and hostility in patterns that illuminate contemporary debates.

**Historiographical debate:**
- Whether the Viking settlements represented invasion or integration remains a significant historiographical question
- Historians debate whether post-war migration to Britain was driven primarily by economic pull factors or by colonial push factors

## Why this study matters

Migration is the most recently developed GCSE thematic study option and the only one to place diversity and identity at the centre of a long-sweep historical narrative. It challenges the notion that immigration is a modern phenomenon and enables pupils to trace continuities in migrant experience across 1,200 years while analysing why attitudes have shifted.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Treating migration as only a modern phenomenon rather than a constant feature of British history
2. Oversimplifying migrant experiences as uniformly negative or positive — emphasise diversity of experience
3. Allowing the study to become a list of migrant groups rather than analysing patterns and themes across the full period

## Sensitive content

- Migration is a politically sensitive topic — present historical evidence and analysis rather than contemporary political opinion
- Racism and discrimination are part of this history and must be addressed honestly but sensitively
- Pupils of migrant heritage may have strong personal connections — create space for their knowledge while maintaining analytical distance
- Avoid reducing any migrant community to a single narrative

---

## Cross-curricular opportunities

| Link | Subject | Connection | Strength |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| The Development Gap and Globalisation | Geography | Push-pull factors of migration; globalisation and movement of people | Strong |
| Poetry Anthology: Power and Conflict | English | Poetry exploring identity, belonging and displacement (Power and Conflict anthology) | Moderate |

## Historical thinking skills (KS4)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Chronological understanding** — Understand and use chronological frameworks to sequence events, periods and changes over time; develop a chronologically secure knowledge of British, local and world history using historical time vocabulary with increasing precision; construct and interpret timelines that place events in meaningful relation to each other.
- **Causation and consequence** — Understand why historical events and changes happened by identifying and explaining multiple causes; assess the intended and unintended consequences of events and decisions; distinguish between long-term structural factors and immediate triggers; construct causal arguments using historical evidence.
- **Change and continuity** — Identify what changed and what remained constant across historical periods; assess the pace, nature and extent of change; distinguish between long-term trends and short-term fluctuations; understand that change can be experienced differently by different groups within the same society.
- **Similarity and difference** — Identify and explain similarities and differences within and across historical periods, societies and cultures; avoid anachronism by understanding people's lives and choices within their own contexts; make valid comparisons that illuminate both the distinctiveness of periods and the common threads of human experience.
- **Historical significance** — Assess the significance of historical events, people and developments using explicit criteria such as scale of impact, duration, number of people affected, degree of change caused, and how an event is remembered and commemorated; understand that significance is not fixed but is constructed and contested by historians and societies over time.
- **Historical evidence** — Locate, select and use a range of primary and secondary historical sources; understand provenance and evaluate a source's utility and reliability in relation to a specific enquiry; corroborate claims across multiple sources; recognise that all sources are partial and that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
