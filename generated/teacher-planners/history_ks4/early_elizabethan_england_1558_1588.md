### Primary concept: Early Elizabethan England 1558-1588 (HI-KS4-C009)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

A British depth study examining the establishment and consolidation of Elizabethan rule, the religious settlement, challenges to Elizabeth's authority, and the social and economic features of Elizabethan society including exploration and the Armada.

**Teaching guidance:** Organise the depth study around four analytical strands: Elizabeth's court and government (the 'problem of a female ruler', marriage question, succession, key advisers such as Cecil); the religious settlement (the 1559 Acts, Puritanism, Catholicism, seminary priests and Jesuits, plots); challenges and threats (Mary Queen of Scots, Northern Rebellion, plots, Spain); and Elizabethan society (the poor, exploration, culture, Drake and the sea dogs). Source analysis should focus on sources that reveal Elizabethan attitudes to queenship, religion, and national identity. For the historic environment element, connect a specific site (e.g., the Globe Theatre site, a country house, a church) to the broad themes of the period.

**Key vocabulary:** Protestant, Catholic, Puritan, religious settlement, Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity, excommunication, seminary priest, recusant, Privy Council, patronage, Spanish Armada, succession, progresses, Drake, sea dogs

**Common misconceptions:** Students often assume Elizabeth's religious settlement was straightforward and popular, overlooking the significant religious tensions it created. Students frequently underestimate the serious nature of the succession question and its implications for stability. Students sometimes treat the Spanish Armada (1588) as the definitive end of the depth study rather than as one of several serious threats to Elizabeth's security across the period.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify some features of Elizabethan England (the queen, the Armada) but has limited contextual knowledge of the political, religious and social complexities of the period. | Who was Elizabeth I and when did she reign? | Providing isolated facts without placing them in their historical context; Not understanding why Elizabeth's accession was controversial or contested |
| **Developing** | Can describe the key features and challenges of Early Elizabethan England with specific factual detail, explaining basic cause-and-effect relationships within the period. | Explain why the religious settlement of 1559 was important for Elizabeth's rule. (4 marks) | Presenting the religious settlement as resolving religious tensions rather than creating new ones; Not explaining why religion was a political as well as a theological issue in this period |
| **Secure** | Can construct sustained analytical responses about the key features and challenges of Elizabethan England, explaining how political, religious, social and economic factors interacted, and deploying specific evidence to support arguments. | How far was the Catholic threat the most serious challenge Elizabeth faced between 1558 and 1588? (16 marks) | Treating the Catholic threat as a single, static challenge rather than one that evolved and interconnected with other issues; Not evaluating the seriousness of the Catholic threat relative to other challenges |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate different historical interpretations of Elizabethan England, assess the significance of the period within the broader sweep of British history, and use source analysis and contextual knowledge together to construct independent historical arguments. | Some historians portray Elizabeth I as a strong and decisive ruler who saved England from religious civil war. Others argue she was indecisive and that her success was due to luck and the skill of her advisers. Which interpretation is more convincing? | Accepting one interpretation uncritically without engaging with the evidence for the other; Not recognising that the evaluation of Elizabeth's reign depends partly on what we mean by effective leadership |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Elizabeth I was queen of England. She ruled from 1558. The Spanish Armada attacked England during her reign.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *The religious settlement of 1559 was important because it tried to find a middle way between Protestantism and Catholicism. The Act of Supremacy made Elizabeth head of the Church of England, and the Act of Uniformity established a Book of Common Prayer that used Protestant theology but kept some Catholic practices like vestments. This was important because Elizabeth needed to avoid the religious conflict that had disrupted England under her predecessors. However, the settlement satisfied neither extreme Puritans who wanted more Protestant reform nor Catholics who rejected Elizabeth's authority over the Church. The settlement was therefore a political compromise designed to maintain stability rather than a complete solution.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *The Catholic threat was serious and persistent, but Elizabeth faced multiple interconnected challenges that are difficult to rank in isolation. The Catholic threat operated at three levels: domestic (recusant Catholics and seminary priests), international (Spain and the Papacy) and personal (Mary Queen of Scots as a Catholic alternative to Elizabeth). The excommunication of Elizabeth by Pope Pius V in 1570 explicitly released Catholics from obedience to her, making Catholicism a political as well as a religious problem. The plots against Elizabeth (Ridolfi 1571, Throckmorton 1583, Babington 1586) demonstrated that the Catholic threat was real and that Mary Queen of Scots was its focal point. However, the succession question was arguably more fundamental: Elizabeth's refusal to marry or name an heir meant that her death at any point would have created a dangerous power vacuum. Parliament's persistent requests for Elizabeth to marry reflected genuine anxiety about the stability of the realm. The financial challenge was also serious: Elizabeth inherited a debt of about 227,000 and had to manage expensive military commitments (the Netherlands, Ireland) with limited income. If we define 'most serious' as the challenge most likely to end Elizabeth's reign, then the Catholic threat (combined with the succession question, since Mary Queen of Scots linked the two) was the most serious. But Elizabeth's ability to manage all these challenges simultaneously, through a combination of political skill, intelligence networks and calculated ambiguity, meant that none of them destroyed her.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Both interpretations capture part of the truth but oversimplify a complex historical picture. The 'strong ruler' interpretation has merit: the religious settlement of 1559 was a skilful political compromise that avoided the religious wars that devastated France and the Netherlands; Elizabeth's execution of Mary Queen of Scots (1587), though delayed, removed the most dangerous focal point for Catholic opposition; and the defeat of the Armada (1588) secured England's independence from Spain. Elizabeth's longevity on the throne (45 years) in an era of religious upheaval is itself evidence of effective rule. However, the 'indecisive' interpretation also has substance: Elizabeth's prolonged refusal to address the succession question created persistent instability; her interventions in the Netherlands and Ireland were often delayed and under-resourced; and her reliance on advisers like Cecil and Walsingham raises the question of how much credit belongs to Elizabeth personally rather than to her government collectively. The most convincing assessment is that Elizabeth's apparent indecisiveness was often a deliberate strategy: delay and ambiguity kept her options open and prevented opponents from organising against a clear policy. Her management of the marriage question, for example, kept multiple European suitors engaged without committing her to any alliance that might have limited her independence. Whether this constitutes strong leadership or lucky evasion depends on the historian's definition of political skill. The luck argument cannot be entirely dismissed — the weather that scattered the Armada was not Elizabeth's doing — but the consistent pattern of survival through four decades of crisis suggests more than coincidence.*

### Secondary concept: Causation (HI-KS4-C001)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

The identification, explanation, and evaluation of the factors that caused historical events and developments. Causation involves distinguishing between multiple causes, assessing their relative importance, and understanding how causes interact over different timescales.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify one or two causes of a historical event but struggles to explain the mechanism by which causes led to outcomes or to distinguish between different types of cause. | Listing causes without explaining how they led to the outcome; Confusing background context with actual causes |
| **Developing** | Can explain multiple causes with supporting detail, distinguishing between long-term and short-term causes and beginning to explain how causes interact. | Describing causes without explaining the mechanism by which they led to the specific outcome; Not distinguishing between long-term underlying causes and short-term triggers |
| **Secure** | Can construct a sustained causal argument that categorises causes by type and timescale, explains their interaction, and evaluates their relative importance with substantiated reasoning. | Asserting that one cause was most important without comparing it to other causes; Not explaining why the economic crisis specifically benefited the Nazis rather than other parties |
| **Mastery** | Can construct a sophisticated causal argument that distinguishes between necessary and sufficient conditions, analyses the contingency of historical outcomes, and evaluates causal claims against the available evidence. | Treating the rise of Hitler as inevitable without considering counterfactual possibilities; Not distinguishing between structural conditions that made crisis likely and the specific contingent events that produced the Nazi outcome |

### Secondary concept: Consequence (HI-KS4-C002)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The identification, explanation, and evaluation of the outcomes and effects of historical events and developments. Consequence involves distinguishing between intended and unintended outcomes, immediate and long-term effects, and effects of different scale and significance.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify some outcomes of historical events but tends to focus only on immediate, obvious consequences without considering long-term effects or their relative significance. | Listing consequences without explaining their significance or scale; Focusing only on immediate effects and ignoring longer-term transformations |
| **Developing** | Can explain multiple consequences of a historical event, distinguishing between short-term and long-term effects and beginning to assess who was affected and how. | Describing consequences without specifying who was affected and how their lives changed; Not distinguishing between intended and unintended consequences |
| **Secure** | Can analyse consequences across multiple dimensions (political, social, economic), evaluate their relative significance using explicit criteria, and distinguish between intended and unintended outcomes. | Treating abolition of the trade as equivalent to the abolition of slavery itself; Not considering the consequences from the perspective of enslaved peoples as well as from the British perspective |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate the full chain of consequences flowing from a historical event, assess which consequences were most historically significant using criteria-based reasoning, and consider how the assessment of consequences changes over time. | Selecting a consequence as most significant without applying explicit criteria for comparison; Not recognising that assessments of significance change depending on the criteria used and the historical perspective adopted |

### Secondary concept: Source Analysis and Evaluation (HI-KS4-C005)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

The systematic analysis and evaluation of sources contemporary to the historical period, assessing their content, provenance, nature, and purpose to make substantiated judgements about their usefulness as historical evidence (AO3).

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can read and describe what a source says (its content) but cannot evaluate its provenance, purpose or usefulness as historical evidence. | Only describing what the source says without considering who made it and why; Taking the source at face value without considering its purpose or limitations |
| **Developing** | Can describe the content and identify the provenance of a source, and begin to explain how provenance affects the source's value as evidence, though analysis may be formulaic. | Dismissing a source as biased without explaining how the bias affects its usefulness for a specific enquiry; Not using own knowledge to support or challenge the source's claims |
| **Secure** | Can evaluate sources systematically using content, provenance and contextual knowledge, making substantiated judgements about usefulness for a specific historical enquiry and distinguishing between reliability and usefulness. | Analysing each source in isolation rather than considering what they reveal in combination; Confusing reliability (is the source accurate?) with usefulness (does the source help us understand the enquiry question?) |
| **Mastery** | Can use source analysis as a tool for constructing historical arguments, critically evaluating what sources reveal and conceal about a historical question, and understanding the epistemological challenges of reconstructing the past from incomplete and biased evidence. | Evaluating sources in isolation rather than considering how they work together and against each other; Not considering what is absent from the available evidence and what that absence reveals |

### Secondary concept: Similarity and Difference (HI-KS4-C013)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The systematic comparison of historical situations, societies, or periods to identify what they shared and how they differed, as a tool for historical analysis and for evaluating historical generalisations.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify some similarities and differences between historical situations but lists them without analysis or a concluding judgement about the degree of similarity. | Listing surface-level similarities and differences without explaining their significance; Not drawing a conclusion about the overall degree of similarity or difference |
| **Developing** | Can identify and explain meaningful similarities and differences between historical situations with supporting detail, and begin to draw conclusions about the overall degree of similarity. | Identifying similarities and differences without explaining the reasons behind them; Not reaching an overall judgement about whether the situations were fundamentally similar or different |
| **Secure** | Can use similarity and difference as an analytical tool to construct historical arguments, distinguishing between surface-level similarities and fundamental structural differences. | Presenting settler and Indian experiences as equally difficult without recognising the structural asymmetry of the power relationship; Identifying surface-level similarities without analysing the fundamental differences in cause, context and power |
| **Mastery** | Can use comparative analysis to evaluate historical generalisations, challenge oversimplified characterisations, and develop nuanced arguments about the degree and significance of similarity and difference across historical contexts. | Accepting the generalisation uncritically or rejecting it entirely, rather than evaluating where it holds and where it breaks down; Making comparisons at only one level (structural) without considering ideological, economic and cultural differences |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** The religious settlement and threats to the Crown are causal puzzles — why was a compromise settlement chosen? What caused Catholic conspiracies to intensify? What made the Armada fail? — requiring pupils to identify multiple interacting causes and evaluate their relative significance.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- Is this a necessary cause, a sufficient cause, or a contributing factor?
- What confounding variables could explain this relationship?
- How would you design an investigation to establish causation, not just correlation?
- In this causal chain, where could an intervention have the most effect?

**Secondary lens:** Perspective and Interpretation — Elizabethan depth study is distinguished by its reliance on primary source analysis — pupils evaluate the utility, reliability and provenance of a wide range of documents and images from the period, and must understand that historical knowledge of this era is constructed from partial, interested sources.

## Session structure: Case Study + Source Enquiry

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Case Study (main structure)
An in-depth investigation of a specific real-world example, location, or scenario. Starts with locating and describing the case in context, collects and organises relevant data, analyses patterns and processes, compares with other cases where appropriate, and reaches an evaluative conclusion.

`locate_and_describe` → `introduction` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `comparison` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Written case study report with data presentation (tables, graphs, maps), analysis of findings, and evaluative conclusion that addresses the original enquiry question.

**Teacher note:** Use the CASE STUDY template: frame the case within a broader theoretical or conceptual context. Expect pupils to select and justify appropriate data collection methods. Guide critical analysis using subject-specific frameworks and quantitative techniques where appropriate. Demand evaluative conclusions that consider the typicality of the case and the generalisability of findings.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does this case illustrate or challenge the broader theory?
- What are the strengths and weaknesses of the data collection methods used?
- To what extent can we generalise from this case study?
- How would you evaluate the significance of your findings in the wider context?

### Source Enquiry
A disciplinary history enquiry centred on working with primary and secondary sources. Pupils select relevant sources, contextualise them within their historical period, interrogate them for reliability, utility, and bias, cross-reference between sources, interpret what they reveal, and construct an argument based on the evidence.

`source_selection` → `contextualisation` → `interrogation` → `cross_referencing` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Source-based extended writing that demonstrates ability to analyse provenance, cross-reference sources, reach substantiated interpretations, and construct a historical argument.

**Teacher note:** Use the SOURCE ENQUIRY template: present a diverse source base for an exam-standard historical enquiry. Expect rigorous analysis of provenance, purpose, and historical context for each source. Demand sophisticated cross-referencing that weighs sources against each other and against contextual knowledge. Guide the construction of a sustained argument that uses evidence precisely and addresses the question directly.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does the purpose and context of this source affect its value as evidence?
- How would you weigh this source against others to assess its reliability?
- What does this source reveal when read against the wider historical context?
- How would you construct an argument that deploys source evidence precisely and addresses counter-interpretations?

## Primary sources

1 historically grounded source types are available for this study:

### 1. The Armada Portrait of Elizabeth I (KS3 analysis) (Primary Visual, )
See HSRC-005 for full provenance. At KS3, the portrait is analysed in greater depth as a piece of political propaganda: the symbolism of the globe, the pearl ropes, the English fleet and the wrecked Armada are all decoded as deliberate statements of power, legitimacy and divine favour.

**How to use:** At KS3: systematic propaganda analysis. Identify every symbol in the painting and decode its meaning. Ask: 'Who was this portrait painted for?' and 'What message is Elizabeth sending to her subjects and to foreign powers?' Then: 'This is one person's version of Elizabeth. How would a Catholic recusant, or a Spanish diplomat, have depicted her differently?' This develops the concept that all historical representations are constructions.

## Disciplinary concepts foregrounded

| Concept | Key question | Role in this study |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Cause and Consequence | Why did this happen, and what were the effects? | At KS4, construct multi-causal explanations of Elizabethan events: why did the Armada fail? Consider political, religious, military, economic, and contingent factors. Evaluate relative importance. |
| Evidence and Interpretation | How do we know about this, and how do historians disagree? | At KS4, evaluate Elizabethan sources rigorously for provenance and purpose. Analyse propaganda (Armada Portrait, Ditchley Portrait) as deliberately constructed images of power. |
| Significance | Why does this matter, and to whom? | At KS4, evaluate the significance of the Armada defeat: was it a genuine turning point in European politics, or has its significance been inflated by English nationalism? |
| Similarity and Difference | How was this similar to or different from other times, places, or peoples? | At KS4, compare Catholic and Puritan opposition to Elizabeth: how were their methods and motivations similar and different? |

## Key figures and events

**Key figures:** Elizabeth I, Mary Queen of Scots, Philip II of Spain, Francis Drake, William Cecil, Francis Walsingham

**Key events:**
- Elizabethan Religious Settlement 1559
- Northern Rebellion 1569
- Ridolfi Plot 1571
- Execution of Mary Queen of Scots 1587
- Defeat of Spanish Armada 1588

**Period:** 1558 - 1588

**Perspectives to include:** Elizabeth I, Catholic recusant, Puritan, Spanish ambassador, ordinary Elizabethan

**Significance claim:** The first thirty years of Elizabeth's reign established England as a Protestant nation, navigated the most dangerous religious and political tensions of the age, and laid the foundations for England's emergence as a significant European power.

**Historiographical debate:**
- Whether Elizabeth's religious settlement was a genuine compromise or a Protestant victory dressed as moderation remains debated by historians
- Historians disagree about the extent of the threat posed by Mary Queen of Scots and whether execution was justified or politically motivated

---

## Why this study matters

Early Elizabethan England is the most widely studied British depth study at GCSE. The 30-year period is tightly focused, enabling genuine depth rather than breadth. The interplay between religion, politics, foreign policy and social change creates rich opportunities for multi-causal analysis. The Armada provides a dramatic climactic event.

---

## Sequencing

**Follows:** The Elizabethan Age

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Presenting Elizabeth as a singular genius rather than analysing the political context and her advisors' contributions
2. Treating the Armada defeat as inevitable rather than analysing why Spain lost and the role of contingency
3. Accepting the 'Golden Age' framing uncritically when poverty, religious persecution and social inequality were widespread

## Sensitive content

- Religious persecution (of Catholics and Puritans) should be discussed with sensitivity and analytical distance
- The execution of Mary Queen of Scots raises questions about justice, politics and gender — avoid sensationalism
- Exploration and early colonisation involved violence against indigenous peoples — present from multiple perspectives

---

## Cross-curricular opportunities

| Link | Subject | Connection | Strength |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| Macbeth: Ambition and Moral Decline | English | Macbeth (written 1606) explores kingship, legitimacy and political violence in the immediate aftermath of the Elizabethan era | Strong |

## Historical thinking skills (KS4)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Chronological understanding** — Understand and use chronological frameworks to sequence events, periods and changes over time; develop a chronologically secure knowledge of British, local and world history using historical time vocabulary with increasing precision; construct and interpret timelines that place events in meaningful relation to each other.
- **Causation and consequence** — Understand why historical events and changes happened by identifying and explaining multiple causes; assess the intended and unintended consequences of events and decisions; distinguish between long-term structural factors and immediate triggers; construct causal arguments using historical evidence.
- **Change and continuity** — Identify what changed and what remained constant across historical periods; assess the pace, nature and extent of change; distinguish between long-term trends and short-term fluctuations; understand that change can be experienced differently by different groups within the same society.
- **Similarity and difference** — Identify and explain similarities and differences within and across historical periods, societies and cultures; avoid anachronism by understanding people's lives and choices within their own contexts; make valid comparisons that illuminate both the distinctiveness of periods and the common threads of human experience.
- **Historical significance** — Assess the significance of historical events, people and developments using explicit criteria such as scale of impact, duration, number of people affected, degree of change caused, and how an event is remembered and commemorated; understand that significance is not fixed but is constructed and contested by historians and societies over time.
- **Historical evidence** — Locate, select and use a range of primary and secondary historical sources; understand provenance and evaluate a source's utility and reliability in relation to a specific enquiry; corroborate claims across multiple sources; recognise that all sources are partial and that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
