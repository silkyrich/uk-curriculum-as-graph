## Enquiry questions

1. Why did medical progress stall between 1250 and 1700?
2. Was germ theory the most important turning point in the history of medicine?
3. How far was progress in medicine driven by individuals rather than broader factors?
4. Why did it take so long for governments to accept responsibility for public health?

## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Medicine in Britain (HI-KS4-C008)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

A thematic study tracing the development of medicine, public health, and understanding of disease in Britain from c1250 to the present. Examines changing theories of disease, the development of medical treatments, surgery, and the role of government, war, and technology in driving medical progress.

**Teaching guidance:** The central analytical framework is the interplay between ideas (theories of disease), individuals (key medical figures), government (public health policy), science and technology, and war (as an accelerant of medical progress). Teach students to assess each development against this explanatory framework. Key turning points to evaluate: the Black Death and its impact on medical understanding; the Renaissance and the rejection of Galenic theory; the germ theory revolution (Pasteur and Koch); the development of antiseptic surgery (Lister); the impact of World War One on surgery and psychology; the NHS (1948). The Western Front as a historic environment component should be integrated to show medicine in wartime conditions.

**Key vocabulary:** germ theory, miasma, supernatural, anatomy, dissection, vaccination, antiseptic, anesthetic, public health, surgery, epidemiology, clinical trial, pharmaceutical, NHS, spontaneous generation

**Common misconceptions:** Students often present medical history as a linear story of continuous progress, overlooking periods of stagnation and the persistence of incorrect ideas (e.g., miasma theory survived well into the 19th century alongside germ theory). Students frequently credit individual genius without explaining the social, technological, and economic conditions that made discovery possible. Students confuse the discovery of a medical advance with its widespread adoption, which often lagged by decades.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can recall some facts about historical medicine but cannot explain the theories of disease that underpinned medical practice or the factors that drove medical change. | How did people try to cure the Black Death in the medieval period? | Describing treatments without connecting them to the theories of disease that explained why people thought they would work; Treating medieval medicine as simply ignorant rather than logical within the belief system of the time |
| **Developing** | Can explain the main theories of disease in different historical periods and identify key turning points in medical progress, with supporting factual detail. | Explain how the germ theory of disease changed the treatment of illness. (4 marks) | Presenting germ theory as immediately and universally accepted rather than initially controversial and resisted; Not explaining the theory's significance for both treatment and prevention |
| **Secure** | Can construct a sustained argument about change and continuity in medicine across the thematic study period, evaluating the relative importance of different factors and identifying turning points with substantiated reasoning. | Was the role of individuals or the role of government more important in improving medicine and public health in Britain between 1250 and the present? (16 marks) | Treating individuals and government as competing explanations rather than recognising their interdependence; Not distinguishing between the importance of factors for medical knowledge and their importance for public health outcomes |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate the full explanatory framework of the thematic study (individuals, government, war, science and technology, attitudes and beliefs), assess how factors interacted at specific historical moments, and integrate the historic environment component into a sophisticated analytical argument. | Using your knowledge of the Western Front (1914-1918) and the broader history of medicine in Britain, evaluate the claim that war has been the single most important factor in driving medical progress. | Over-generalising from the Western Front to the entire history of medicine without testing the claim across other periods; Not integrating the historic environment evidence into the broader analytical argument about factors driving change |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *People tried praying to God and carrying flowers to stop the bad smells. Some people whipped themselves to ask God for forgiveness.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Before germ theory, most people believed disease was caused by miasma (bad air) or an imbalance of humours. Pasteur's germ theory (1861) proved that specific micro-organisms caused specific diseases. This changed treatment because once doctors knew what caused a disease, they could target the cause rather than just treating symptoms. For example, Koch identified the specific bacterium that caused tuberculosis (1882), which eventually led to targeted treatments. Lister used carbolic acid to kill germs during surgery (1867), dramatically reducing infection and death rates. Germ theory was a turning point because it provided a scientific basis for medicine for the first time.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Both individuals and government have been essential to medical progress, but they contributed in different ways and at different times. Before the 19th century, medical progress depended almost entirely on individuals because government had little involvement in public health. Key individuals include Vesalius (accurate anatomy, 1543), Harvey (circulation of the blood, 1628) and Jenner (smallpox vaccination, 1796). These breakthroughs in understanding were made by individual talent and persistence, often against institutional resistance. However, from the mid-19th century onwards, government became increasingly important because the scale of public health challenges required state action that individuals could not provide. The 1848 and 1875 Public Health Acts compelled local authorities to provide clean water and sewage disposal, which had more impact on population health than any individual medical discovery. The creation of the NHS in 1948 was government's most significant contribution: by making healthcare free and universal, it transformed the health of the population as a whole. The relationship between individuals and government is not one of competition but of interdependence: individuals made the discoveries (germ theory, penicillin, DNA), but government created the systems (clean water, hospitals, vaccination programmes, the NHS) that translated those discoveries into mass health improvements. Without Pasteur, there would be no germ theory; without government legislation, germ theory would not have led to clean water supplies for millions. Therefore, neither factor alone is sufficient to explain medical progress. However, if forced to choose, government has been more important for public health outcomes because the most significant reductions in mortality came from environmental improvements (clean water, sewage, housing) and universal healthcare access rather than from individual medical breakthroughs.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *The Western Front provides a powerful case study for this claim but also reveals its limitations. On the Western Front, the unprecedented scale of injury drove rapid innovation: the Thomas splint reduced leg amputation mortality from 80% to 20%; X-rays were used for the first time to locate shrapnel; blood transfusion techniques were developed to treat mass casualties; and the psychological impact of shellfire forced recognition of shell shock as a medical condition. These advances were directly caused by the wartime conditions of industrial warfare, which created both the medical necessity and the government funding for rapid progress. However, the claim that war was the single most important factor overreaches in three ways. First, the Western Front advances built on pre-existing knowledge: antiseptic surgery, germ theory and anaesthesia were peacetime discoveries that wartime conditions merely accelerated. Without the scientific foundations established by Pasteur, Koch and Lister, wartime medicine would have been unable to make these advances. Second, the most significant improvements in population health — clean water, sanitation, vaccination, the NHS — were peacetime achievements driven by government policy and public health campaigning, not by war. The reduction in infant mortality from the 1900s to the 1950s owed more to the midwife service, health visitors and school medical inspections than to any wartime advance. Third, the claim that war drove progress applies mainly to the 20th century: medieval and early modern wars produced mass casualties but no corresponding medical innovation, because the scientific and institutional infrastructure for translating wartime experience into medical progress did not yet exist. The Western Front therefore illustrates that war can accelerate progress, but only when other conditions are already in place: scientific knowledge, institutional capacity, and government willingness to fund innovation. War is a catalyst, not an independent driver.*

### Secondary concept: Causation (HI-KS4-C001)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

The identification, explanation, and evaluation of the factors that caused historical events and developments. Causation involves distinguishing between multiple causes, assessing their relative importance, and understanding how causes interact over different timescales.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify one or two causes of a historical event but struggles to explain the mechanism by which causes led to outcomes or to distinguish between different types of cause. | Listing causes without explaining how they led to the outcome; Confusing background context with actual causes |
| **Developing** | Can explain multiple causes with supporting detail, distinguishing between long-term and short-term causes and beginning to explain how causes interact. | Describing causes without explaining the mechanism by which they led to the specific outcome; Not distinguishing between long-term underlying causes and short-term triggers |
| **Secure** | Can construct a sustained causal argument that categorises causes by type and timescale, explains their interaction, and evaluates their relative importance with substantiated reasoning. | Asserting that one cause was most important without comparing it to other causes; Not explaining why the economic crisis specifically benefited the Nazis rather than other parties |
| **Mastery** | Can construct a sophisticated causal argument that distinguishes between necessary and sufficient conditions, analyses the contingency of historical outcomes, and evaluates causal claims against the available evidence. | Treating the rise of Hitler as inevitable without considering counterfactual possibilities; Not distinguishing between structural conditions that made crisis likely and the specific contingent events that produced the Nazi outcome |

### Secondary concept: Change and Continuity (HI-KS4-C003)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The analytical framework for assessing what changed and what remained constant across historical periods. Involves identifying the nature, pace, extent, and significance of change, and explaining what factors drove or prevented it.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can recognise that things changed over time but tends to describe change as total and sudden rather than analysing its nature, pace and extent alongside what remained constant. | Presenting change as a simple before-and-after contrast without explaining the process of change; Ignoring continuities by implying everything changed at once |
| **Developing** | Can identify specific changes and continuities within a historical period, explain some factors that drove or prevented change, and recognise that change was not uniform. | Identifying change and continuity without explaining the reasons behind them; Treating all change as equally important without assessing its significance |
| **Secure** | Can construct a sustained analytical argument about the nature, pace and extent of change across a historical period, identifying turning points and periods of stagnation and evaluating what drove or prevented change. | Identifying a turning point without evaluating how quickly change actually occurred in practice; Neglecting to discuss continuities alongside changes |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate the concept of turning points critically, argue about the relative significance of different drivers of change, and assess how the pace of change was shaped by the interaction of factors such as technology, ideas, individuals, government and war. | Asserting war was the most important factor without comparing it systematically with other factors across the full timespan; Not distinguishing between wartime innovations and their subsequent implementation in peacetime medicine |

### Secondary concept: Historical Significance (HI-KS4-C004)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

The criteria-based evaluation of why certain events, individuals, or developments matter historically. Significance is not inherent in events but is constructed by historians using explicit criteria relating to impact, scale, durability, and relevance to later developments.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can state that some events or people were important in history but cannot explain why using explicit criteria or historical reasoning. | Asserting that something was significant without explaining why; Using circular reasoning (significant because it was important) |
| **Developing** | Can explain why a historical event, person or development was significant using one or two criteria such as impact at the time or long-term legacy. | Explaining significance using only one criterion without considering others; Describing what the event was without assessing its importance relative to other developments |
| **Secure** | Can make substantiated significance judgements using multiple criteria, compare the significance of different events or developments, and recognise that significance can be assessed differently depending on perspective and timeframe. | Comparing significance without establishing and applying consistent criteria; Not recognising that the same development can have different levels of significance depending on the criteria and perspective used |
| **Mastery** | Can critically evaluate how and why historical significance is constructed, recognising that significance judgements are shaped by the historian's perspective, values and context, and can apply this understanding to analyse historiographical debates. | Treating historical significance as purely objective or purely subjective, rather than as constructed through criteria-based reasoning; Not connecting historiographical disagreement to the broader epistemological point about how historical knowledge is produced |

### Secondary concept: Historical Interpretations (HI-KS4-C006)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

The analysis and evaluation of historians' accounts and representations of the past, assessing how and why interpretations differ and how convincing each interpretation is given the available evidence (AO4).

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can recognise that historians sometimes disagree about the past but treats interpretations as opinions rather than evidence-based arguments that can be evaluated. | Treating historical interpretations as matters of personal opinion rather than reasoned arguments based on evidence; Agreeing or disagreeing based on personal preference rather than on analysis of the evidence and reasoning |
| **Developing** | Can identify how two interpretations differ and suggest reasons why historians might disagree, such as having different evidence or writing at different times. | Simply describing what each interpretation says without explaining why they differ; Assuming that disagreement means one interpretation must be wrong |
| **Secure** | Can evaluate the convincingness of a historical interpretation by assessing its argument, the evidence it uses, and the evidence it omits, while recognising the legitimate reasons why interpretations differ. | Saying 'I agree' or 'I disagree' without explaining why the interpretation is or is not convincing based on evidence; Not using own contextual knowledge to test the claims made in the interpretation |
| **Mastery** | Can analyse the historiographical context of competing interpretations, understanding how changes in evidence, methodology and perspective produce different historical accounts, and can construct an independent evaluative position. | Treating changing interpretations as simply 'getting better' rather than understanding the structural reasons why interpretations change; Not connecting historiographical change to broader shifts in society, politics and methodology |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Explaining why punishments changed (from public execution to rehabilitation) requires tracing the causal roles of Enlightenment philosophy, industrialisation, changing state capacity and shifting public attitudes — multi-factor causal reasoning applied across a long timespan.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- Is this a necessary cause, a sufficient cause, or a contributing factor?
- What confounding variables could explain this relationship?
- How would you design an investigation to establish causation, not just correlation?
- In this causal chain, where could an intervention have the most effect?

**Secondary lens:** Continuity and Change Over Time — Crime and punishment is a thematic study explicitly designed to train continuity_change analysis — pupils must identify which types of crime, which punishments, and which underlying attitudes have persisted across centuries versus changed dramatically, which requires systematic comparison across multiple time periods.

## Session structure: Topic Study + Source Enquiry

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Topic Study (main structure)
A structured enquiry into a defined topic, period, or place. Begins with an engaging hook to capture interest, builds contextual knowledge, moves through source analysis and interpretation, and culminates in a substantiated argument or conclusion. The core humanities template.

`hook` → `context` → `source_analysis` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Extended writing task presenting a reasoned argument supported by evidence from the topic. Can take the form of an essay, structured explanation, or debate position.

**Teacher note:** Use the TOPIC STUDY template: frame the session around a contested or historiographically significant question. Establish the scholarly context and competing interpretations. Guide pupils through critical source analysis with attention to provenance, purpose, and value. Expect a sustained, well-structured argument that evaluates competing claims and reaches a substantiated judgement.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does the provenance of this source affect its value for this enquiry?
- How would different historiographical perspectives interpret this evidence?
- What are the strengths and limitations of this argument?
- How would you construct a sustained response that evaluates competing interpretations?

### Source Enquiry
A disciplinary history enquiry centred on working with primary and secondary sources. Pupils select relevant sources, contextualise them within their historical period, interrogate them for reliability, utility, and bias, cross-reference between sources, interpret what they reveal, and construct an argument based on the evidence.

`source_selection` → `contextualisation` → `interrogation` → `cross_referencing` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Source-based extended writing that demonstrates ability to analyse provenance, cross-reference sources, reach substantiated interpretations, and construct a historical argument.

**Teacher note:** Use the SOURCE ENQUIRY template: present a diverse source base for an exam-standard historical enquiry. Expect rigorous analysis of provenance, purpose, and historical context for each source. Demand sophisticated cross-referencing that weighs sources against each other and against contextual knowledge. Guide the construction of a sustained argument that uses evidence precisely and addresses the question directly.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does the purpose and context of this source affect its value as evidence?
- How would you weigh this source against others to assess its reliability?
- What does this source reveal when read against the wider historical context?
- How would you construct an argument that deploys source evidence precisely and addresses counter-interpretations?

## Disciplinary concepts foregrounded

| Concept | Key question | Role in this study |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Change and Continuity | What changed, what stayed the same, and why? | At KS4, analyse WHY medical progress was faster in some periods than others. Identify the conditions (war, printing, government intervention) that accelerated or inhibited change. |
| Cause and Consequence | Why did this happen, and what were the effects? | At KS4, for each breakthrough (vaccination, germ theory, penicillin), analyse the multiple factors that made it possible: individuals, science, technology, war, chance, and government. |
| Significance | Why does this matter, and to whom? | At KS4, evaluate turning points: was germ theory more significant than the NHS? Use criteria (scale of impact, duration, number affected) to construct argued evaluations. |
| Evidence and Interpretation | How do we know about this, and how do historians disagree? | At KS4, evaluate medical sources (e.g. medieval medical texts, Victorian public health reports) for provenance and utility. Analyse why historians disagree about the significance of individuals vs broader factors. |

## Key figures and events

**Key figures:** Hippocrates, Galen, Vesalius, Harvey, Jenner, Pasteur, Koch, Fleming, Nightingale, Chadwick, Beveridge

**Key events:**
- Black Death 1348
- Vesalius publishes anatomy 1543
- Harvey's circulation theory 1628
- Jenner's vaccination 1796
- Pasteur's germ theory 1861
- NHS established 1948

**Period:** c1250 - present

**Perspectives to include:** medieval physician, Renaissance anatomist, Victorian public health reformer, WW1 field surgeon, NHS patient

**Significance claim:** The history of medicine reveals how scientific understanding, technology, government policy and individual brilliance interact to transform human health outcomes — and how progress can stall for centuries when conditions are unfavourable.

**Historiographical debate:**
- Whether the Renaissance represented genuine medical progress or just a return to classical methods remains debated
- Historians disagree about the relative importance of individuals (e.g. Fleming) versus broader factors (e.g. government funding, war) in driving medical breakthroughs

---

## Why this study matters

Medicine in Britain is the second most popular GCSE thematic study. It combines intellectual history (ideas about disease causation), social history (public health provision), and biography (key individuals like Jenner, Nightingale, Fleming). The dramatic contrast between medieval humoralism and modern germ theory provides a compelling through-line for change and continuity analysis.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Presenting medical history as a simple march from ignorance to enlightenment, ignoring periods of stagnation and the rationality of humoralism within its own knowledge framework
2. Over-emphasising individual genius at the expense of broader factors (war, technology, government, chance)
3. Rushing the medieval period to spend more time on modern medicine, when the exam requires balanced coverage of all three eras

## Sensitive content

- Descriptions of surgical procedures without anaesthesia — present analytically, not graphically
- The Black Death involved mass death — contextualise historically
- Some pupils may have personal connections to NHS treatment or medical conditions — handle with empathy

---

## Historical thinking skills (KS4)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Chronological understanding** — Understand and use chronological frameworks to sequence events, periods and changes over time; develop a chronologically secure knowledge of British, local and world history using historical time vocabulary with increasing precision; construct and interpret timelines that place events in meaningful relation to each other.
- **Causation and consequence** — Understand why historical events and changes happened by identifying and explaining multiple causes; assess the intended and unintended consequences of events and decisions; distinguish between long-term structural factors and immediate triggers; construct causal arguments using historical evidence.
- **Change and continuity** — Identify what changed and what remained constant across historical periods; assess the pace, nature and extent of change; distinguish between long-term trends and short-term fluctuations; understand that change can be experienced differently by different groups within the same society.
- **Similarity and difference** — Identify and explain similarities and differences within and across historical periods, societies and cultures; avoid anachronism by understanding people's lives and choices within their own contexts; make valid comparisons that illuminate both the distinctiveness of periods and the common threads of human experience.
- **Historical significance** — Assess the significance of historical events, people and developments using explicit criteria such as scale of impact, duration, number of people affected, degree of change caused, and how an event is remembered and commemorated; understand that significance is not fixed but is constructed and contested by historians and societies over time.
- **Historical evidence** — Locate, select and use a range of primary and secondary historical sources; understand provenance and evaluate a source's utility and reliability in relation to a specific enquiry; corroborate claims across multiple sources; recognise that all sources are partial and that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
