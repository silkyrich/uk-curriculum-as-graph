## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: The American West c1835-c1895 (HI-KS4-C011)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

A period study examining the migration and settlement of the American West, the experience of the Plains Indians (including Sioux and other nations), conflicts over land and resources, the cattle industry, and the transformation of the West through government policy, railroads, and settlement.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach students to examine the West from multiple perspectives: Plains Indians (their way of life, beliefs, resistance, and experience of dispossession), settlers (motivations for migration, challenges of homesteading), ranchers and cowboys (cattle industry development), and the US government (reservation policy, wars, Dawes Act). The period has a clear narrative arc from early migration to the closing of the frontier (1890s) but should be taught thematically as well as chronologically, with explicit attention to why the Plains Indians' way of life was destroyed. Key analytical question: was the destruction of Plains Indian culture the result of deliberate genocide, economic necessity, or cultural misunderstanding? Practise evaluating historical interpretations of this question.

**Key vocabulary:** Plains Indians, Sioux, reservation, Treaty of Fort Laramie, Homestead Act, transcontinental railroad, cattle drive, longhorn, range wars, Dawes Act, Ghost Dance, Battle of Little Bighorn, manifest destiny, frontier

**Common misconceptions:** Students often present Plains Indian culture in a stereotyped and static way, missing its sophistication, diversity, and adaptability. Students sometimes treat the westward migration as naturally or inevitably leading to the displacement of Native Americans, without examining the specific policy choices and conflicts that produced this outcome. Students often conflate all Plains Indian nations rather than recognising significant cultural and political differences between groups.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify that settlers moved west in America and that there were conflicts with Native Americans, but has limited factual knowledge of the period or the different groups involved. | Why did people move to the American West in the 19th century? | Giving only one or two generic reasons without specific detail; Not distinguishing between different waves of migration or different motivations |
| **Developing** | Can describe the main features of the American West period with specific factual detail, including the experiences of different groups, and explain basic cause-and-effect relationships. | Explain two challenges faced by homesteaders on the Great Plains. (4 marks) | Describing challenges without specific detail about the Plains environment; Not explaining how homesteaders attempted to overcome these challenges |
| **Secure** | Can construct sustained analytical arguments about the American West, examining the experiences and interactions of multiple groups (settlers, Plains Indians, ranchers, government) and evaluating the causes and consequences of key developments. | How far do you agree that the destruction of the Plains Indians' way of life was caused mainly by the actions of the US government? (16 marks) | Attributing the destruction entirely to the government without considering the role of economic forces and settler pressure; Not examining the perspective and agency of Plains Indian nations in responding to encroachment |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate competing interpretations of the American West, critically assess the concept of Manifest Destiny and its historiographical legacy, and connect the period study to broader questions about colonialism and indigenous rights. | How have historical interpretations of the American West changed, and what do these changes tell us about how the period should be studied? | Treating the revisionist interpretation as simply 'correcting' the older one rather than understanding both as products of their time; Not connecting historiographical changes to broader shifts in society and political consciousness |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *People moved west to find land and gold. They wanted a better life.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *One challenge was the harsh physical environment. The Plains had extreme temperatures: very hot summers and freezing winters with blizzards. The soil was hard and dry, covered by tough prairie grass that was difficult to plough with ordinary equipment. Water was scarce because rainfall was low. Homesteaders had to adapt by using new technologies like the steel plough and windmill. A second challenge was isolation. Homesteads were often miles from the nearest neighbour or town, with no roads. Families, especially women, faced loneliness and had to be self-sufficient in medical emergencies, education and protection from threats like locusts, which could destroy an entire season's crops in hours.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *The US government played a central role in destroying the Plains Indians' way of life, but government policy operated alongside other factors and was itself driven by the economic pressures of westward expansion. Government actions were decisive at key moments: the Indian Removal policies, the series of broken treaties (Fort Laramie 1851, 1868), the reservation system that confined nations to inadequate land, the deliberate encouragement of buffalo hunting to undermine Indian self-sufficiency, and the Dawes Act (1887) which broke up communal land ownership. The army's campaigns against resistant nations (Sand Creek 1864, Little Bighorn 1876, Wounded Knee 1890) demonstrated the government's willingness to use military force against indigenous people. However, the government's actions were driven by economic forces it did not entirely control: the discovery of gold, the demand for cattle land, and the construction of the transcontinental railroad created powerful economic incentives for settlers and corporations to occupy Indian territory. The railroad companies, cattle ranchers and mining interests lobbied government to open Indian lands. The destruction of the buffalo herds — which decimated the Plains Indians' food supply, shelter and cultural foundations — was primarily carried out by commercial hunters rather than by government forces, though the government supported and facilitated it. Therefore, the government was the most important single agent of destruction because it had the legal authority to make treaties and break them, the military power to enforce dispossession, and the legislative capacity to reshape Indian land ownership. But government action was itself driven by the economic logic of settler capitalism and the ideology of Manifest Destiny, which treated westward expansion as inevitable and Indian resistance as an obstacle to be removed.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Interpretations of the American West have undergone a fundamental transformation that mirrors broader changes in how colonial history is understood. The traditional 'frontier thesis' (Frederick Jackson Turner, 1893) presented westward expansion as the defining force in American democracy, emphasising rugged individualism, opportunity and the triumph of civilisation over wilderness. This interpretation, which dominated for decades, was written entirely from the settler perspective and treated the 'frontier' as empty space rather than inhabited land. From the 1960s-70s, revisionist historians (Dee Brown, Patricia Limerick) reframed the 'winning of the West' as a story of conquest, dispossession and cultural destruction. Brown's 'Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee' (1970) told the story from the Native American perspective, documenting broken treaties, massacres and forced removals. This interpretation drew on indigenous oral histories and government records that revealed the systematic nature of dispossession. More recent historiography has moved beyond simple reversal of the Turner thesis towards more complex analysis. Historians now examine the diversity within both settler and Native American communities, the agency and adaptation of indigenous peoples in responding to colonialism, the role of gender and race in shaping the Western experience, and the environmental consequences of settlement. The question of terminology itself is revealing: 'frontier' implies a boundary between civilisation and wilderness; 'conquest' implies military domination; 'colonisation' places the American West in a global context of European imperial expansion. These changes tell us that the American West should be studied using multiple perspectives and voices, with attention to power, agency, and the long-term consequences of the choices made during this period. The period has direct relevance to contemporary debates about indigenous rights, land ownership, and how nations reckon with their colonial past.*

### Secondary concept: Causation (HI-KS4-C001)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

The identification, explanation, and evaluation of the factors that caused historical events and developments. Causation involves distinguishing between multiple causes, assessing their relative importance, and understanding how causes interact over different timescales.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify one or two causes of a historical event but struggles to explain the mechanism by which causes led to outcomes or to distinguish between different types of cause. | Listing causes without explaining how they led to the outcome; Confusing background context with actual causes |
| **Developing** | Can explain multiple causes with supporting detail, distinguishing between long-term and short-term causes and beginning to explain how causes interact. | Describing causes without explaining the mechanism by which they led to the specific outcome; Not distinguishing between long-term underlying causes and short-term triggers |
| **Secure** | Can construct a sustained causal argument that categorises causes by type and timescale, explains their interaction, and evaluates their relative importance with substantiated reasoning. | Asserting that one cause was most important without comparing it to other causes; Not explaining why the economic crisis specifically benefited the Nazis rather than other parties |
| **Mastery** | Can construct a sophisticated causal argument that distinguishes between necessary and sufficient conditions, analyses the contingency of historical outcomes, and evaluates causal claims against the available evidence. | Treating the rise of Hitler as inevitable without considering counterfactual possibilities; Not distinguishing between structural conditions that made crisis likely and the specific contingent events that produced the Nazi outcome |

### Secondary concept: Consequence (HI-KS4-C002)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The identification, explanation, and evaluation of the outcomes and effects of historical events and developments. Consequence involves distinguishing between intended and unintended outcomes, immediate and long-term effects, and effects of different scale and significance.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify some outcomes of historical events but tends to focus only on immediate, obvious consequences without considering long-term effects or their relative significance. | Listing consequences without explaining their significance or scale; Focusing only on immediate effects and ignoring longer-term transformations |
| **Developing** | Can explain multiple consequences of a historical event, distinguishing between short-term and long-term effects and beginning to assess who was affected and how. | Describing consequences without specifying who was affected and how their lives changed; Not distinguishing between intended and unintended consequences |
| **Secure** | Can analyse consequences across multiple dimensions (political, social, economic), evaluate their relative significance using explicit criteria, and distinguish between intended and unintended outcomes. | Treating abolition of the trade as equivalent to the abolition of slavery itself; Not considering the consequences from the perspective of enslaved peoples as well as from the British perspective |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate the full chain of consequences flowing from a historical event, assess which consequences were most historically significant using criteria-based reasoning, and consider how the assessment of consequences changes over time. | Selecting a consequence as most significant without applying explicit criteria for comparison; Not recognising that assessments of significance change depending on the criteria used and the historical perspective adopted |

### Secondary concept: Change and Continuity (HI-KS4-C003)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The analytical framework for assessing what changed and what remained constant across historical periods. Involves identifying the nature, pace, extent, and significance of change, and explaining what factors drove or prevented it.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can recognise that things changed over time but tends to describe change as total and sudden rather than analysing its nature, pace and extent alongside what remained constant. | Presenting change as a simple before-and-after contrast without explaining the process of change; Ignoring continuities by implying everything changed at once |
| **Developing** | Can identify specific changes and continuities within a historical period, explain some factors that drove or prevented change, and recognise that change was not uniform. | Identifying change and continuity without explaining the reasons behind them; Treating all change as equally important without assessing its significance |
| **Secure** | Can construct a sustained analytical argument about the nature, pace and extent of change across a historical period, identifying turning points and periods of stagnation and evaluating what drove or prevented change. | Identifying a turning point without evaluating how quickly change actually occurred in practice; Neglecting to discuss continuities alongside changes |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate the concept of turning points critically, argue about the relative significance of different drivers of change, and assess how the pace of change was shaped by the interaction of factors such as technology, ideas, individuals, government and war. | Asserting war was the most important factor without comparing it systematically with other factors across the full timespan; Not distinguishing between wartime innovations and their subsequent implementation in peacetime medicine |

### Secondary concept: Similarity and Difference (HI-KS4-C013)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The systematic comparison of historical situations, societies, or periods to identify what they shared and how they differed, as a tool for historical analysis and for evaluating historical generalisations.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify some similarities and differences between historical situations but lists them without analysis or a concluding judgement about the degree of similarity. | Listing surface-level similarities and differences without explaining their significance; Not drawing a conclusion about the overall degree of similarity or difference |
| **Developing** | Can identify and explain meaningful similarities and differences between historical situations with supporting detail, and begin to draw conclusions about the overall degree of similarity. | Identifying similarities and differences without explaining the reasons behind them; Not reaching an overall judgement about whether the situations were fundamentally similar or different |
| **Secure** | Can use similarity and difference as an analytical tool to construct historical arguments, distinguishing between surface-level similarities and fundamental structural differences. | Presenting settler and Indian experiences as equally difficult without recognising the structural asymmetry of the power relationship; Identifying surface-level similarities without analysing the fundamental differences in cause, context and power |
| **Mastery** | Can use comparative analysis to evaluate historical generalisations, challenge oversimplified characterisations, and develop nuanced arguments about the degree and significance of similarity and difference across historical contexts. | Accepting the generalisation uncritically or rejecting it entirely, rather than evaluating where it holds and where it breaks down; Making comparisons at only one level (structural) without considering ideological, economic and cultural differences |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Explaining why Weimar democracy failed and why the Nazis rose to power is the paradigm GCSE causal question — pupils must weigh the contributions of economic crisis, political weakness, Nazi strategy, and international pressure in a multi-factor causal explanation, then trace the consequences of Nazi consolidation for German society.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- Is this a necessary cause, a sufficient cause, or a contributing factor?
- What confounding variables could explain this relationship?
- How would you design an investigation to establish causation, not just correlation?
- In this causal chain, where could an intervention have the most effect?

**Secondary lens:** Perspective and Interpretation — Understanding how ordinary Germans experienced and responded to Nazism requires examining the same events from multiple perspectives — believers, opportunists, bystanders, resisters and persecuted groups — each of whom held a different understanding of what was happening and what was permissible.

## Session structure: Topic Study + Source Enquiry

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Topic Study (main structure)
A structured enquiry into a defined topic, period, or place. Begins with an engaging hook to capture interest, builds contextual knowledge, moves through source analysis and interpretation, and culminates in a substantiated argument or conclusion. The core humanities template.

`hook` → `context` → `source_analysis` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Extended writing task presenting a reasoned argument supported by evidence from the topic. Can take the form of an essay, structured explanation, or debate position.

**Teacher note:** Use the TOPIC STUDY template: frame the session around a contested or historiographically significant question. Establish the scholarly context and competing interpretations. Guide pupils through critical source analysis with attention to provenance, purpose, and value. Expect a sustained, well-structured argument that evaluates competing claims and reaches a substantiated judgement.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does the provenance of this source affect its value for this enquiry?
- How would different historiographical perspectives interpret this evidence?
- What are the strengths and limitations of this argument?
- How would you construct a sustained response that evaluates competing interpretations?

### Source Enquiry
A disciplinary history enquiry centred on working with primary and secondary sources. Pupils select relevant sources, contextualise them within their historical period, interrogate them for reliability, utility, and bias, cross-reference between sources, interpret what they reveal, and construct an argument based on the evidence.

`source_selection` → `contextualisation` → `interrogation` → `cross_referencing` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Source-based extended writing that demonstrates ability to analyse provenance, cross-reference sources, reach substantiated interpretations, and construct a historical argument.

**Teacher note:** Use the SOURCE ENQUIRY template: present a diverse source base for an exam-standard historical enquiry. Expect rigorous analysis of provenance, purpose, and historical context for each source. Demand sophisticated cross-referencing that weighs sources against each other and against contextual knowledge. Guide the construction of a sustained argument that uses evidence precisely and addresses the question directly.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does the purpose and context of this source affect its value as evidence?
- How would you weigh this source against others to assess its reliability?
- What does this source reveal when read against the wider historical context?
- How would you construct an argument that deploys source evidence precisely and addresses counter-interpretations?

## Disciplinary concepts foregrounded

| Concept | Key question | Role in this study |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Cause and Consequence | Why did this happen, and what were the effects? | At KS4, analyse the multiple causes of westward expansion (economic, religious, political, technological) and the devastating consequences for Plains Indian societies. |
| Change and Continuity | What changed, what stayed the same, and why? | At KS4, trace how the West changed between 1835 and 1895: from indigenous homeland to settler territory. What drove the pace of change, and what attempts were made to resist it? |
| Similarity and Difference | How was this similar to or different from other times, places, or peoples? | At KS4, compare Plains Indian and white settler cultures using consistent criteria (land use, governance, religion, economy). Analyse the fundamental differences that made coexistence so difficult. |
| Evidence and Interpretation | How do we know about this, and how do historians disagree? | At KS4, evaluate sources from multiple perspectives: settler diaries, government documents, indigenous oral testimony. Analyse how the 'frontier thesis' has been challenged by revisionist historians. |

## Key figures and events

**Key figures:** Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, George Custer, William 'Buffalo Bill' Cody, Joseph Smith, Brigham Young

**Key events:**
- Oregon Trail migration 1840s
- California Gold Rush 1848-49
- Homestead Act 1862
- Transcontinental Railroad 1869
- Battle of Little Bighorn 1876
- Wounded Knee Massacre 1890

**Period:** c1835 - c1895

**Perspectives to include:** Plains Indian chief, white settler family, US cavalry officer, Mormon migrant, Chinese railroad worker, Buffalo hunter

**Significance claim:** The transformation of the American West from indigenous homelands to settled agricultural and industrial territory within 60 years represents one of the most dramatic and contested episodes of colonialism, environmental transformation and cultural conflict in modern history.

**Historiographical debate:**
- Whether westward expansion should be framed as 'progress' or 'colonialism' remains a fundamental interpretive question
- Historians have increasingly challenged the 'frontier thesis' (Frederick Jackson Turner) that presented expansion as the defining American experience, arguing it erases indigenous perspectives

---

## Why this study matters

The American West challenges pupils to move beyond Hollywood stereotypes and engage with the complex reality of westward expansion: the destruction of Native American societies, the motivations of diverse migrant groups, and the role of the US government in shaping the West. The study develops pupils' ability to analyse competing perspectives and challenge popular myths.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Reproducing Hollywood stereotypes of Native Americans rather than presenting their societies as complex, sophisticated and diverse
2. Framing westward expansion purely from the settlers' perspective without centring indigenous experiences of displacement and destruction
3. Treating the American West as a single period when motivations and conditions changed significantly between the 1830s and 1890s

## Sensitive content

- The destruction of Native American societies involves genocide, forced removal and cultural erasure — present with historical seriousness and sensitivity
- Wounded Knee (1890) was a massacre of unarmed people including women and children — handle with care
- Avoid romanticising either settler or indigenous cultures — present both with analytical nuance
- Some pupils may have Native American heritage or connections — create space for their knowledge and perspectives

---

## Cross-curricular opportunities

| Link | Subject | Connection | Strength |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| The Development Gap and Globalisation | Geography | Push-pull factors of migration; the role of natural resources in economic development and inequality | Moderate |

## Historical thinking skills (KS4)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Chronological understanding** — Understand and use chronological frameworks to sequence events, periods and changes over time; develop a chronologically secure knowledge of British, local and world history using historical time vocabulary with increasing precision; construct and interpret timelines that place events in meaningful relation to each other.
- **Causation and consequence** — Understand why historical events and changes happened by identifying and explaining multiple causes; assess the intended and unintended consequences of events and decisions; distinguish between long-term structural factors and immediate triggers; construct causal arguments using historical evidence.
- **Change and continuity** — Identify what changed and what remained constant across historical periods; assess the pace, nature and extent of change; distinguish between long-term trends and short-term fluctuations; understand that change can be experienced differently by different groups within the same society.
- **Similarity and difference** — Identify and explain similarities and differences within and across historical periods, societies and cultures; avoid anachronism by understanding people's lives and choices within their own contexts; make valid comparisons that illuminate both the distinctiveness of periods and the common threads of human experience.
- **Historical significance** — Assess the significance of historical events, people and developments using explicit criteria such as scale of impact, duration, number of people affected, degree of change caused, and how an event is remembered and commemorated; understand that significance is not fixed but is constructed and contested by historians and societies over time.
- **Historical evidence** — Locate, select and use a range of primary and secondary historical sources; understand provenance and evaluate a source's utility and reliability in relation to a specific enquiry; corroborate claims across multiple sources; recognise that all sources are partial and that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
