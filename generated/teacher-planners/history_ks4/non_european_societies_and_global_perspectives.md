## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Non-European Societies and Global Perspectives (HI-KS4-C016)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 5/6

The study of historically significant societies outside Britain and Europe — such as imperial China, Mughal India, the Ottoman Empire, or pre-Columbian American civilisations — that developed distinctive political structures, cultures, economies, and intellectual traditions. These societies are studied not as exotic contrasts to European norms but as historically significant in their own right, developing through their own internal dynamics. At GCSE, the world depth study develops students' capacity to apply historical analysis to unfamiliar historical contexts, suspending assumptions derived from British or European history and engaging with different social formations, belief systems, and structures of power.

**Teaching guidance:** Avoid framing non-European societies purely in relation to Europe or Britain. Study each society on its own terms first: its political system, economy, culture, religion, and social structure. Then examine how it connected with, contrasted with, or was transformed by contact with other societies. For source analysis in non-European contexts, discuss how the availability of evidence differs from European contexts: archaeological evidence may be primary, oral traditions may carry historical authority that written sources do not, and colonial sources may distort understanding of pre-colonial societies. Connect to the broader GCSE skill of applying second-order concepts across unfamiliar contexts.

**Key vocabulary:** dynasty, empire, caliphate, sultanate, shogunate, tribute system, imperial court, bureaucracy, trade network, cultural exchange, oral tradition, archaeology, indigenous, pre-colonial, globalisation

**Common misconceptions:** Students frequently apply European historical frameworks (feudalism, Renaissance, industrial revolution) to non-European societies where they do not fit. Students sometimes present non-European history only through the lens of European contact or colonisation, obscuring the pre-contact internal development of these societies. Students may treat non-European societies as monolithic and static rather than recognising internal diversity, conflict, and change.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify that significant societies existed outside Europe but has limited factual knowledge of their features, achievements or historical development. | Name one non-European civilisation you have studied and describe one feature of it. | Knowing only one or two isolated facts about a non-European society; Presenting non-European societies only through the lens of European contact |
| **Developing** | Can describe the key features of a non-European society with specific factual detail and explain how it was organised politically, economically and socially. | Describe the key features of the Mughal Empire in India. (4 marks) | Describing the society only in terms of its contact with Europeans rather than on its own terms; Treating the non-European society as static rather than recognising internal development, diversity and change |
| **Secure** | Can analyse non-European societies using the full range of second-order historical concepts, explain how they developed through internal dynamics as well as external contacts, and compare them meaningfully with European historical developments. | How useful is the concept of 'decline' for understanding the late Mughal Empire? Consider both internal and external factors. (12 marks) | Accepting a simple 'decline' narrative without critically examining the concept; Treating European colonisation as the natural consequence of internal weakness rather than as an independent historical force |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate the historiographical challenges of studying non-European societies, including questions of evidence, perspective and the legacy of colonial historiography, and can apply second-order concepts to unfamiliar contexts with analytical sophistication. | What challenges do historians face when studying non-European societies, and how do these challenges affect the interpretations they produce? | Treating the challenges as reasons to avoid studying non-European history rather than as methodological questions to be addressed; Not recognising that similar (though less acute) methodological challenges apply to all historical study |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *The Mughal Empire was in India. They built the Taj Mahal.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *The Mughal Empire (1526-1857) was one of the largest and wealthiest empires in the world. It was an Islamic dynasty ruling over a predominantly Hindu population, which required sophisticated systems of religious tolerance and administrative inclusion. Under rulers like Akbar (1556-1605), the empire developed an efficient bureaucracy, a standardised tax system, and patronised extraordinary artistic and architectural achievements including the Taj Mahal and miniature painting. The empire's economy was based on agriculture, manufacturing (particularly cotton textiles) and trade, and its GDP was larger than the whole of Western Europe in the 17th century.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *The concept of 'decline' is partially useful but also misleading for understanding the late Mughal Empire. The standard narrative of Mughal decline identifies the death of Aurangzeb (1707) as the turning point: his policies of religious intolerance alienated Hindu subjects and the Maratha Confederacy, and after his death, provincial governors became increasingly independent. By the mid-18th century, the emperor had little effective power beyond Delhi. This narrative is useful because it identifies real internal weaknesses: the empire's dependence on military expansion for revenue, the failure to develop an effective succession mechanism, and the centrifugal tendency of provincial power. However, the concept of 'decline' is problematic for several reasons. First, it implies that the empire's trajectory was inevitably downward, ignoring the possibility that political fragmentation could have been reversed. Second, it frames the arrival of European colonial power as simply filling a vacuum, rather than recognising that British conquest was an active, violent process of imperialism. Third, it focuses on the central state while ignoring the vitality of regional successor states (the Marathas, Hyderabad, Mysore) that developed sophisticated political and economic systems after Mughal central authority weakened. The most historically accurate assessment is that the Mughal Empire experienced political fragmentation rather than civilisational decline, and that British colonial expansion was driven by British ambitions and military-commercial power rather than by Indian weakness alone.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *Historians studying non-European societies face distinctive methodological challenges that shape the interpretations they produce. The first is the evidence problem: much of the available evidence about non-European societies was produced by European colonisers, missionaries and traders, whose accounts reflect their own assumptions, prejudices and purposes. Colonial court records, missionary accounts and European travel narratives provide detailed evidence but from an external perspective that may distort or misunderstand the societies they describe. Internal evidence — court records, literature, art, oral traditions — exists but may be less accessible to Western-trained historians due to language barriers, different archival traditions and the destruction of records during colonial conquest. The second challenge is the analytical framework problem: many of the concepts used to analyse European history (feudalism, the Renaissance, the nation-state, industrialisation) do not transfer straightforwardly to non-European contexts. Applying European categories to non-European societies risks either finding them 'deficient' (lacking what Europe had) or distorting their distinctive features to fit European models. Postcolonial historians (Dipesh Chakrabarty, Gayatri Spivak) have argued that the entire discipline of history was shaped by European assumptions and that 'provincialising Europe' — recognising European history as one particular tradition among many rather than the universal standard — is necessary for genuine global history. The third challenge is the representation problem: who has the authority to write about a non-European society? How should indigenous voices, oral traditions and non-textual evidence be integrated into academic historical writing? These challenges do not make the history of non-European societies unknowable, but they do require historians to be self-conscious about their methods, their sources and their assumptions in ways that studying European history may not.*

### Secondary concept: Change and Continuity (HI-KS4-C003)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The analytical framework for assessing what changed and what remained constant across historical periods. Involves identifying the nature, pace, extent, and significance of change, and explaining what factors drove or prevented it.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can recognise that things changed over time but tends to describe change as total and sudden rather than analysing its nature, pace and extent alongside what remained constant. | Presenting change as a simple before-and-after contrast without explaining the process of change; Ignoring continuities by implying everything changed at once |
| **Developing** | Can identify specific changes and continuities within a historical period, explain some factors that drove or prevented change, and recognise that change was not uniform. | Identifying change and continuity without explaining the reasons behind them; Treating all change as equally important without assessing its significance |
| **Secure** | Can construct a sustained analytical argument about the nature, pace and extent of change across a historical period, identifying turning points and periods of stagnation and evaluating what drove or prevented change. | Identifying a turning point without evaluating how quickly change actually occurred in practice; Neglecting to discuss continuities alongside changes |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate the concept of turning points critically, argue about the relative significance of different drivers of change, and assess how the pace of change was shaped by the interaction of factors such as technology, ideas, individuals, government and war. | Asserting war was the most important factor without comparing it systematically with other factors across the full timespan; Not distinguishing between wartime innovations and their subsequent implementation in peacetime medicine |

### Secondary concept: Historical Significance (HI-KS4-C004)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

The criteria-based evaluation of why certain events, individuals, or developments matter historically. Significance is not inherent in events but is constructed by historians using explicit criteria relating to impact, scale, durability, and relevance to later developments.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can state that some events or people were important in history but cannot explain why using explicit criteria or historical reasoning. | Asserting that something was significant without explaining why; Using circular reasoning (significant because it was important) |
| **Developing** | Can explain why a historical event, person or development was significant using one or two criteria such as impact at the time or long-term legacy. | Explaining significance using only one criterion without considering others; Describing what the event was without assessing its importance relative to other developments |
| **Secure** | Can make substantiated significance judgements using multiple criteria, compare the significance of different events or developments, and recognise that significance can be assessed differently depending on perspective and timeframe. | Comparing significance without establishing and applying consistent criteria; Not recognising that the same development can have different levels of significance depending on the criteria and perspective used |
| **Mastery** | Can critically evaluate how and why historical significance is constructed, recognising that significance judgements are shaped by the historian's perspective, values and context, and can apply this understanding to analyse historiographical debates. | Treating historical significance as purely objective or purely subjective, rather than as constructed through criteria-based reasoning; Not connecting historiographical disagreement to the broader epistemological point about how historical knowledge is produced |

### Secondary concept: Historical Interpretations (HI-KS4-C006)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

The analysis and evaluation of historians' accounts and representations of the past, assessing how and why interpretations differ and how convincing each interpretation is given the available evidence (AO4).

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can recognise that historians sometimes disagree about the past but treats interpretations as opinions rather than evidence-based arguments that can be evaluated. | Treating historical interpretations as matters of personal opinion rather than reasoned arguments based on evidence; Agreeing or disagreeing based on personal preference rather than on analysis of the evidence and reasoning |
| **Developing** | Can identify how two interpretations differ and suggest reasons why historians might disagree, such as having different evidence or writing at different times. | Simply describing what each interpretation says without explaining why they differ; Assuming that disagreement means one interpretation must be wrong |
| **Secure** | Can evaluate the convincingness of a historical interpretation by assessing its argument, the evidence it uses, and the evidence it omits, while recognising the legitimate reasons why interpretations differ. | Saying 'I agree' or 'I disagree' without explaining why the interpretation is or is not convincing based on evidence; Not using own contextual knowledge to test the claims made in the interpretation |
| **Mastery** | Can analyse the historiographical context of competing interpretations, understanding how changes in evidence, methodology and perspective produce different historical accounts, and can construct an independent evaluative position. | Treating changing interpretations as simply 'getting better' rather than understanding the structural reasons why interpretations change; Not connecting historiographical change to broader shifts in society, politics and methodology |

### Secondary concept: Similarity and Difference (HI-KS4-C013)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The systematic comparison of historical situations, societies, or periods to identify what they shared and how they differed, as a tool for historical analysis and for evaluating historical generalisations.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify some similarities and differences between historical situations but lists them without analysis or a concluding judgement about the degree of similarity. | Listing surface-level similarities and differences without explaining their significance; Not drawing a conclusion about the overall degree of similarity or difference |
| **Developing** | Can identify and explain meaningful similarities and differences between historical situations with supporting detail, and begin to draw conclusions about the overall degree of similarity. | Identifying similarities and differences without explaining the reasons behind them; Not reaching an overall judgement about whether the situations were fundamentally similar or different |
| **Secure** | Can use similarity and difference as an analytical tool to construct historical arguments, distinguishing between surface-level similarities and fundamental structural differences. | Presenting settler and Indian experiences as equally difficult without recognising the structural asymmetry of the power relationship; Identifying surface-level similarities without analysing the fundamental differences in cause, context and power |
| **Mastery** | Can use comparative analysis to evaluate historical generalisations, challenge oversimplified characterisations, and develop nuanced arguments about the degree and significance of similarity and difference across historical contexts. | Accepting the generalisation uncritically or rejecting it entirely, rather than evaluating where it holds and where it breaks down; Making comparisons at only one level (structural) without considering ideological, economic and cultural differences |

## Thinking lens: Perspective and Interpretation (primary)

**Key question:** Whose perspective is this, what shapes it, and what might be missing?

**Why this lens fits:** Non-European depth study explicitly counters Eurocentric historical framing — pupils must engage with how imperial China, Mughal India or the Ottoman Empire understood their own history and achievements, which requires taking seriously perspectives that are structurally marginalised in the standard British history curriculum.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- How do power structures determine whose perspective dominates this narrative?
- What are the epistemological limits of interpreting this source?
- How would you position your interpretation within the existing historiographical debate?
- Can two contradictory interpretations both be valid? Under what conditions?

**Secondary lens:** Cause and Effect — Cold War analysis requires tracing a complex causal network — ideological antagonism, nuclear deterrence, proxy conflicts and détente — and evaluating competing explanations for the war's onset, escalation, de-escalation and eventual end, making it one of the most demanding multi-factor causal analysis tasks at GCSE.

## Session structure: Topic Study + Source Enquiry

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Topic Study (main structure)
A structured enquiry into a defined topic, period, or place. Begins with an engaging hook to capture interest, builds contextual knowledge, moves through source analysis and interpretation, and culminates in a substantiated argument or conclusion. The core humanities template.

`hook` → `context` → `source_analysis` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Extended writing task presenting a reasoned argument supported by evidence from the topic. Can take the form of an essay, structured explanation, or debate position.

**Teacher note:** Use the TOPIC STUDY template: frame the session around a contested or historiographically significant question. Establish the scholarly context and competing interpretations. Guide pupils through critical source analysis with attention to provenance, purpose, and value. Expect a sustained, well-structured argument that evaluates competing claims and reaches a substantiated judgement.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does the provenance of this source affect its value for this enquiry?
- How would different historiographical perspectives interpret this evidence?
- What are the strengths and limitations of this argument?
- How would you construct a sustained response that evaluates competing interpretations?

### Source Enquiry
A disciplinary history enquiry centred on working with primary and secondary sources. Pupils select relevant sources, contextualise them within their historical period, interrogate them for reliability, utility, and bias, cross-reference between sources, interpret what they reveal, and construct an argument based on the evidence.

`source_selection` → `contextualisation` → `interrogation` → `cross_referencing` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Source-based extended writing that demonstrates ability to analyse provenance, cross-reference sources, reach substantiated interpretations, and construct a historical argument.

**Teacher note:** Use the SOURCE ENQUIRY template: present a diverse source base for an exam-standard historical enquiry. Expect rigorous analysis of provenance, purpose, and historical context for each source. Demand sophisticated cross-referencing that weighs sources against each other and against contextual knowledge. Guide the construction of a sustained argument that uses evidence precisely and addresses the question directly.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does the purpose and context of this source affect its value as evidence?
- How would you weigh this source against others to assess its reliability?
- What does this source reveal when read against the wider historical context?
- How would you construct an argument that deploys source evidence precisely and addresses counter-interpretations?

## Disciplinary concepts foregrounded

| Concept | Key question | Role in this study |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Similarity and Difference | How was this similar to or different from other times, places, or peoples? | At KS4, compare the non-European society with contemporary European societies using consistent criteria. Analyse what the comparison reveals about both societies, not just the 'exotic' one. |
| Significance | Why does this matter, and to whom? | At KS4, evaluate the historical significance of the non-European society: what were its lasting contributions to global history? Whose criteria of significance are we using? |
| Evidence and Interpretation | How do we know about this, and how do historians disagree? | At KS4, analyse how non-European societies have been represented in Western historical writing. Evaluate sources from within the society alongside external accounts. |
| Change and Continuity | What changed, what stayed the same, and why? | At KS4, analyse internal dynamics of change within the society: how did it evolve over time, and what drove or constrained change? |

## Why this study matters

This study represents the DfE requirement that GCSE History includes the study of at least one period of non-European history. It can be fulfilled through a range of options depending on exam board: the Mughal Empire, imperial China, the trans-Atlantic slave trade, or other non-European depth studies. The pedagogical value lies in decentring European perspectives and enabling pupils to analyse complex non-European political, economic and cultural systems using the same disciplinary tools they apply to British and European history.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Studying non-European societies only through the lens of their contact with Europe rather than on their own terms
2. Tokenistic coverage that does not give the society the same analytical depth afforded to British or European topics
3. Using Eurocentric criteria (e.g. written law, parliamentary governance) to judge non-European societies

## Sensitive content

- Colonialism and its legacies are sensitive — present factually and from multiple perspectives
- Avoid exoticising non-European cultures — present them with the same analytical seriousness as European history
- Pupils of diverse heritage may have personal connections to the societies studied — honour their knowledge while maintaining analytical distance

## Cross-curricular opportunities

## Historical thinking skills (KS4)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Chronological understanding** — Understand and use chronological frameworks to sequence events, periods and changes over time; develop a chronologically secure knowledge of British, local and world history using historical time vocabulary with increasing precision; construct and interpret timelines that place events in meaningful relation to each other.
- **Causation and consequence** — Understand why historical events and changes happened by identifying and explaining multiple causes; assess the intended and unintended consequences of events and decisions; distinguish between long-term structural factors and immediate triggers; construct causal arguments using historical evidence.
- **Change and continuity** — Identify what changed and what remained constant across historical periods; assess the pace, nature and extent of change; distinguish between long-term trends and short-term fluctuations; understand that change can be experienced differently by different groups within the same society.
- **Similarity and difference** — Identify and explain similarities and differences within and across historical periods, societies and cultures; avoid anachronism by understanding people's lives and choices within their own contexts; make valid comparisons that illuminate both the distinctiveness of periods and the common threads of human experience.
- **Historical significance** — Assess the significance of historical events, people and developments using explicit criteria such as scale of impact, duration, number of people affected, degree of change caused, and how an event is remembered and commemorated; understand that significance is not fixed but is constructed and contested by historians and societies over time.
- **Historical evidence** — Locate, select and use a range of primary and secondary historical sources; understand provenance and evaluate a source's utility and reliability in relation to a specific enquiry; corroborate claims across multiple sources; recognise that all sources are partial and that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
