## Enquiry questions

1. Has punishment become more humane over time, or just different?
2. Why have definitions of crime changed so dramatically since 1000?
3. Was the abolition of the death penalty a turning point, or one step in a longer process?
4. How far has the role of the state in law enforcement changed since medieval times?

## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Crime and Punishment in Britain (HI-KS4-C007)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

A thematic study tracing the development of crime, law enforcement, and punishment in Britain from c1000 to the present. Examines changing definitions of crime, evolving systems of policing and courts, changing philosophies of punishment, and continuities in criminal activity and justice.

**Teaching guidance:** Organise teaching around three eras: medieval (c1000-1500), early modern (c1500-1700), and modern (c1700-present). Within each era, use the same analytical categories: types of crime, methods of law enforcement, forms of punishment, and underlying factors (religious, social, economic, political). Teach students to evaluate whether developments such as the creation of the police force (1829) or the abolition of capital punishment (1965) represent genuine turning points or evolutionary steps within longer trends. The historic environment component (typically Whitechapel, c1870-1900) should be integrated to show how a specific urban environment shaped crime and policing in the Victorian period.

**Key vocabulary:** crime, punishment, law enforcement, capital punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, reformation, retribution, policing, constable, magistrate, assize court, transportation, imprisonment, corporal punishment

**Common misconceptions:** Students often assume that punishment always became more humane over time, overlooking the persistence of harsh punishments and the complex relationship between punishment, social context, and penal philosophy. Students sometimes conflate legal change with social change, assuming that new laws immediately altered behaviour. Students in the Whitechapel component often present contextual knowledge without connecting it explicitly to how the environment shaped crime and policing.

| **Emerging** | Can recall some facts about crime and punishment in different periods but cannot explain why definitions of crime, methods of law enforcement or philosophies of punishment changed over time. | Name one type of punishment used in medieval England. | Listing punishments without explaining their purpose or context; Assuming all medieval punishments were harsh and all modern ones are lenient |
| **Developing** | Can describe the main features of crime and punishment in different eras and explain some reasons why practices changed, using specific examples. | Explain why the creation of the Metropolitan Police in 1829 was an important development in the history of law enforcement. (4 marks) | Describing the creation of the police without explaining why it represented a change in approach to crime; Not connecting the development to the broader context of urbanisation and social change |
| **Secure** | Can construct a sustained analysis of change and continuity in crime and punishment across at least three eras, explaining the factors driving change and evaluating whether developments represent genuine turning points. | How far was the abolition of capital punishment in 1965 a turning point in the history of punishment in Britain? (16 marks) | Treating abolition as an isolated event rather than placing it in the longer trajectory of changing penal philosophy; Not acknowledging that public attitudes to punishment did not necessarily change at the same pace as the law |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate the relative importance of different factors driving change in crime and punishment across the full thematic study, construct original arguments about patterns of change and continuity, and integrate the historic environment evidence into a broader analytical framework. | Across the entire period c1000 to the present, which factor has been most important in changing how Britain deals with crime: changing ideas about human nature, changing technology, or the changing role of government? | Selecting one factor without systematically comparing it with others across the full chronological range; Not integrating the historic environment study into the broader thematic argument |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *In medieval times they used public executions and the stocks to punish criminals.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Before 1829, law enforcement relied on unpaid constables and night watchmen who were often ineffective. Robert Peel created the Metropolitan Police as a professional, full-time police force in London. This was important because it established the principle that preventing crime was better than just punishing it after it happened. The police were designed to patrol the streets and deter crime through their visible presence. This was a major change from the old system because for the first time there was a dedicated, trained force whose job was to keep order.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *The abolition of capital punishment in 1965 was a significant turning point because it represented the final rejection of the principle that the state should have the power to take a citizen's life as punishment. The death penalty had been central to the British penal system for centuries: in the 18th century, the 'Bloody Code' prescribed execution for over 200 offences, and public hangings were common. The gradual reduction of capital offences in the 19th century reflected changing attitudes towards punishment, influenced by Enlightenment ideas about reform and rehabilitation. However, execution remained available for murder until 1965, and the debates leading to abolition were fierce, with strong public support for retention. Abolition therefore represented the culmination of a long-term trend towards less physically brutal punishment, which also included the ending of public execution (1868), the reduction of corporal punishment, and the development of the prison system as the primary form of punishment. However, calling abolition a turning point oversimplifies the picture. The shift from punishment as deterrence and retribution towards rehabilitation had been underway since the early 19th century, and abolition was one step in that process rather than a sudden break. Moreover, the debate about appropriate punishment did not end in 1965: periodic calls to restore the death penalty continued for decades, and contemporary debates about sentencing show that the tension between retribution and rehabilitation remains unresolved. Abolition was a decisive legal change, but the cultural shift in attitudes towards punishment was a much longer, more gradual process.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *All three factors have been important, but their relative significance has varied across different periods, and the most compelling argument is that they interact rather than operating independently. Changing ideas about human nature have been the deepest driver of change: the medieval belief that crime was a sin (requiring spiritual punishment and public shaming) gave way to the Enlightenment idea that crime was a rational choice (requiring deterrence through consistent punishment) and then to the modern idea that crime has social causes (requiring rehabilitation and addressing underlying conditions). Each of these shifts in understanding fundamentally changed what punishment was for. However, ideas alone did not produce change: government action was necessary to translate ideas into policy. The creation of the police (1829), the construction of a national prison system (1840s-1860s), and the establishment of probation and parole required state infrastructure that did not exist before. Technology has been most significant in the modern period: fingerprinting, CCTV, DNA evidence and digital surveillance have transformed detection and conviction rates, but these are tools of enforcement rather than changes in penal philosophy. The historic environment of Whitechapel (1870s-1900s) illustrates the interaction of all three factors: overcrowded urban poverty (social conditions) challenged Victorian ideas about criminal responsibility (ideas), and the failure of the new Metropolitan Police to catch Jack the Ripper exposed the limitations of contemporary law enforcement (technology and government). The most historically accurate answer is that no single factor is most important across the whole period, because the relative importance of each factor depends on the specific historical context. However, if forced to choose, changing ideas have been the most fundamental driver because they determine the purpose and justification of the entire criminal justice system, while technology and government are the means by which those ideas are implemented.*

### Secondary concept: Causation (HI-KS4-C001)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

The identification, explanation, and evaluation of the factors that caused historical events and developments. Causation involves distinguishing between multiple causes, assessing their relative importance, and understanding how causes interact over different timescales.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify one or two causes of a historical event but struggles to explain the mechanism by which causes led to outcomes or to distinguish between different types of cause. | Listing causes without explaining how they led to the outcome; Confusing background context with actual causes |
| **Developing** | Can explain multiple causes with supporting detail, distinguishing between long-term and short-term causes and beginning to explain how causes interact. | Describing causes without explaining the mechanism by which they led to the specific outcome; Not distinguishing between long-term underlying causes and short-term triggers |
| **Secure** | Can construct a sustained causal argument that categorises causes by type and timescale, explains their interaction, and evaluates their relative importance with substantiated reasoning. | Asserting that one cause was most important without comparing it to other causes; Not explaining why the economic crisis specifically benefited the Nazis rather than other parties |
| **Mastery** | Can construct a sophisticated causal argument that distinguishes between necessary and sufficient conditions, analyses the contingency of historical outcomes, and evaluates causal claims against the available evidence. | Treating the rise of Hitler as inevitable without considering counterfactual possibilities; Not distinguishing between structural conditions that made crisis likely and the specific contingent events that produced the Nazi outcome |

### Secondary concept: Change and Continuity (HI-KS4-C003)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The analytical framework for assessing what changed and what remained constant across historical periods. Involves identifying the nature, pace, extent, and significance of change, and explaining what factors drove or prevented it.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can recognise that things changed over time but tends to describe change as total and sudden rather than analysing its nature, pace and extent alongside what remained constant. | Presenting change as a simple before-and-after contrast without explaining the process of change; Ignoring continuities by implying everything changed at once |
| **Developing** | Can identify specific changes and continuities within a historical period, explain some factors that drove or prevented change, and recognise that change was not uniform. | Identifying change and continuity without explaining the reasons behind them; Treating all change as equally important without assessing its significance |
| **Secure** | Can construct a sustained analytical argument about the nature, pace and extent of change across a historical period, identifying turning points and periods of stagnation and evaluating what drove or prevented change. | Identifying a turning point without evaluating how quickly change actually occurred in practice; Neglecting to discuss continuities alongside changes |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate the concept of turning points critically, argue about the relative significance of different drivers of change, and assess how the pace of change was shaped by the interaction of factors such as technology, ideas, individuals, government and war. | Asserting war was the most important factor without comparing it systematically with other factors across the full timespan; Not distinguishing between wartime innovations and their subsequent implementation in peacetime medicine |

### Secondary concept: Historical Significance (HI-KS4-C004)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

The criteria-based evaluation of why certain events, individuals, or developments matter historically. Significance is not inherent in events but is constructed by historians using explicit criteria relating to impact, scale, durability, and relevance to later developments.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can state that some events or people were important in history but cannot explain why using explicit criteria or historical reasoning. | Asserting that something was significant without explaining why; Using circular reasoning (significant because it was important) |
| **Developing** | Can explain why a historical event, person or development was significant using one or two criteria such as impact at the time or long-term legacy. | Explaining significance using only one criterion without considering others; Describing what the event was without assessing its importance relative to other developments |
| **Secure** | Can make substantiated significance judgements using multiple criteria, compare the significance of different events or developments, and recognise that significance can be assessed differently depending on perspective and timeframe. | Comparing significance without establishing and applying consistent criteria; Not recognising that the same development can have different levels of significance depending on the criteria and perspective used |
| **Mastery** | Can critically evaluate how and why historical significance is constructed, recognising that significance judgements are shaped by the historian's perspective, values and context, and can apply this understanding to analyse historiographical debates. | Treating historical significance as purely objective or purely subjective, rather than as constructed through criteria-based reasoning; Not connecting historiographical disagreement to the broader epistemological point about how historical knowledge is produced |

### Secondary concept: Source Analysis and Evaluation (HI-KS4-C005)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

The systematic analysis and evaluation of sources contemporary to the historical period, assessing their content, provenance, nature, and purpose to make substantiated judgements about their usefulness as historical evidence (AO3).

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can read and describe what a source says (its content) but cannot evaluate its provenance, purpose or usefulness as historical evidence. | Only describing what the source says without considering who made it and why; Taking the source at face value without considering its purpose or limitations |
| **Developing** | Can describe the content and identify the provenance of a source, and begin to explain how provenance affects the source's value as evidence, though analysis may be formulaic. | Dismissing a source as biased without explaining how the bias affects its usefulness for a specific enquiry; Not using own knowledge to support or challenge the source's claims |
| **Secure** | Can evaluate sources systematically using content, provenance and contextual knowledge, making substantiated judgements about usefulness for a specific historical enquiry and distinguishing between reliability and usefulness. | Analysing each source in isolation rather than considering what they reveal in combination; Confusing reliability (is the source accurate?) with usefulness (does the source help us understand the enquiry question?) |
| **Mastery** | Can use source analysis as a tool for constructing historical arguments, critically evaluating what sources reveal and conceal about a historical question, and understanding the epistemological challenges of reconstructing the past from incomplete and biased evidence. | Evaluating sources in isolation rather than considering how they work together and against each other; Not considering what is absent from the available evidence and what that absence reveals |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** Explaining why punishments changed (from public execution to rehabilitation) requires tracing the causal roles of Enlightenment philosophy, industrialisation, changing state capacity and shifting public attitudes — multi-factor causal reasoning applied across a long timespan.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- Is this a necessary cause, a sufficient cause, or a contributing factor?
- What confounding variables could explain this relationship?
- How would you design an investigation to establish causation, not just correlation?
- In this causal chain, where could an intervention have the most effect?

**Secondary lens:** Continuity and Change Over Time — Crime and punishment is a thematic study explicitly designed to train continuity_change analysis — pupils must identify which types of crime, which punishments, and which underlying attitudes have persisted across centuries versus changed dramatically, which requires systematic comparison across multiple time periods.

## Session structure: Topic Study + Source Enquiry

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Topic Study (main structure)
A structured enquiry into a defined topic, period, or place. Begins with an engaging hook to capture interest, builds contextual knowledge, moves through source analysis and interpretation, and culminates in a substantiated argument or conclusion. The core humanities template.

`hook` → `context` → `source_analysis` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Extended writing task presenting a reasoned argument supported by evidence from the topic. Can take the form of an essay, structured explanation, or debate position.

**Teacher note:** Use the TOPIC STUDY template: frame the session around a contested or historiographically significant question. Establish the scholarly context and competing interpretations. Guide pupils through critical source analysis with attention to provenance, purpose, and value. Expect a sustained, well-structured argument that evaluates competing claims and reaches a substantiated judgement.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does the provenance of this source affect its value for this enquiry?
- How would different historiographical perspectives interpret this evidence?
- What are the strengths and limitations of this argument?
- How would you construct a sustained response that evaluates competing interpretations?

### Source Enquiry
A disciplinary history enquiry centred on working with primary and secondary sources. Pupils select relevant sources, contextualise them within their historical period, interrogate them for reliability, utility, and bias, cross-reference between sources, interpret what they reveal, and construct an argument based on the evidence.

`source_selection` → `contextualisation` → `interrogation` → `cross_referencing` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Source-based extended writing that demonstrates ability to analyse provenance, cross-reference sources, reach substantiated interpretations, and construct a historical argument.

**Teacher note:** Use the SOURCE ENQUIRY template: present a diverse source base for an exam-standard historical enquiry. Expect rigorous analysis of provenance, purpose, and historical context for each source. Demand sophisticated cross-referencing that weighs sources against each other and against contextual knowledge. Guide the construction of a sustained argument that uses evidence precisely and addresses the question directly.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does the purpose and context of this source affect its value as evidence?
- How would you weigh this source against others to assess its reliability?
- What does this source reveal when read against the wider historical context?
- How would you construct an argument that deploys source evidence precisely and addresses counter-interpretations?

## Disciplinary concepts foregrounded

| Concept | Key question | Role in this study |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Change and Continuity | What changed, what stayed the same, and why? | At KS4, the thematic study IS a change-and-continuity exercise. Pupils must identify patterns across 1,000 years: acceleration, turning points, regression, and stubborn continuities. Construct analytical narratives, not chronological lists. |
| Cause and Consequence | Why did this happen, and what were the effects? | At KS4, explain WHY attitudes changed at specific moments (e.g. urbanisation driving the creation of police forces). Multi-factor causal analysis connecting political, social, economic and technological causes. |
| Significance | Why does this matter, and to whom? | At KS4, evaluate which changes were genuine turning points vs incremental shifts. Was the abolition of the death penalty the most significant change in the history of punishment? |
| Evidence and Interpretation | How do we know about this, and how do historians disagree? | At KS4, evaluate historical sources for provenance and purpose. Compare how historians have interpreted the same evidence differently (e.g. contrasting views of the Bloody Code's effectiveness). |

## Key figures and events

**Key figures:** Henry II, Robert Peel, Elizabeth Fry, Jack the Ripper (case), Derek Bentley (case)

**Key events:**
- Introduction of common law (Henry II)
- Witchcraft Acts 1563-1736
- Bloody Code c1688-1823
- Metropolitan Police 1829
- Abolition of death penalty 1965

**Period:** c1000 - present

**Perspectives to include:** medieval villager, 18th-century highway robber, Victorian prison reformer, 20th-century police officer, crime victim

**Significance claim:** Crime and punishment reveals how society's deepest values about justice, authority and individual rights have evolved over a millennium, from trial by ordeal to the modern criminal justice system.

**Historiographical debate:**
- Whether punishment has become genuinely more humane or simply less visible is a contested historical and sociological argument
- Historians disagree about whether the Bloody Code was genuinely intended to deter crime or served primarily to protect property owners

---

## Why this study matters

Crime and punishment is the most widely chosen GCSE thematic study because it offers a clear through-line across 1,000 years while touching on every aspect of social, political and legal change. The contrast between medieval and modern attitudes to punishment (public execution vs rehabilitation) is inherently engaging and supports sophisticated analysis of change and continuity. The thematic structure demands a qualitatively different kind of historical thinking from period studies: pattern recognition across centuries rather than depth in a single era.

---

## Sequencing

**Follows:** Challenges 1901 to Present Day

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Presenting the history of punishment as a simple progress narrative from cruelty to enlightenment, when the reality includes periods of regression
2. Treating the thematic study as a series of separate period snapshots rather than analysing genuine patterns of change across the full sweep
3. Spending too long on medieval content and rushing the modern period, which carries the most marks at GCSE

## Sensitive content

- Graphic descriptions of historical punishment methods (hanging, burning, flogging) — teach analytically rather than sensationally
- The Witchcraft Acts disproportionately targeted women — discuss within the context of gender, power and scapegoating
- Derek Bentley case involves execution of a teenager — handle with sensitivity around age and justice

## Cross-curricular opportunities

| Link | Subject | Connection | Strength |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| Transactional Writing: Speech | English | Persuasive writing and rhetorical analysis of courtroom speeches and campaign texts (e.g. Elizabeth Fry's arguments for prison reform) | Moderate |

## Historical thinking skills (KS4)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Chronological understanding** — Understand and use chronological frameworks to sequence events, periods and changes over time; develop a chronologically secure knowledge of British, local and world history using historical time vocabulary with increasing precision; construct and interpret timelines that place events in meaningful relation to each other.
- **Causation and consequence** — Understand why historical events and changes happened by identifying and explaining multiple causes; assess the intended and unintended consequences of events and decisions; distinguish between long-term structural factors and immediate triggers; construct causal arguments using historical evidence.
- **Change and continuity** — Identify what changed and what remained constant across historical periods; assess the pace, nature and extent of change; distinguish between long-term trends and short-term fluctuations; understand that change can be experienced differently by different groups within the same society.
- **Similarity and difference** — Identify and explain similarities and differences within and across historical periods, societies and cultures; avoid anachronism by understanding people's lives and choices within their own contexts; make valid comparisons that illuminate both the distinctiveness of periods and the common threads of human experience.
- **Historical significance** — Assess the significance of historical events, people and developments using explicit criteria such as scale of impact, duration, number of people affected, degree of change caused, and how an event is remembered and commemorated; understand that significance is not fixed but is constructed and contested by historians and societies over time.
- **Historical evidence** — Locate, select and use a range of primary and secondary historical sources; understand provenance and evaluate a source's utility and reliability in relation to a specific enquiry; corroborate claims across multiple sources; recognise that all sources are partial and that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
