## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Norman England 1066-1100 (HI-KS4-C014)

**Type:** Knowledge | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

A British depth study examining the Norman Conquest, the consolidation of Norman control over England, the Domesday Book, the relationship between crown and church, and the experience of the English under Norman rule.

**Teaching guidance:** Structure teaching around the key questions: How did William conquer and then control England? How did Norman rule transform English society? What was the relationship between William and the Church? How did ordinary English people experience Norman rule? Key events and developments: Hastings (1066) and its causes; the harrying of the North; the feudal system and castle building; Domesday Book (1086); the Investiture Controversy; Norman culture and language. For source analysis, focus on the Bayeux Tapestry as a complex primary source that rewards analysis of perspective and purpose. Historic environment connections: Norman castles (e.g., Dover, Colchester, Tower of London) as physical evidence of conquest and control.

**Key vocabulary:** Norman Conquest, Battle of Hastings, feudalism, Domesday Book, knight, motte and bailey, castle, baron, vassal, homage, Witan, investiture, excommunication, harrying, Anglo-Saxon, Bayeux Tapestry

**Common misconceptions:** Students often treat the Norman Conquest as an abrupt break with Anglo-Saxon England rather than a gradual and contested process of cultural and administrative transformation. Students frequently underestimate the resistance to Norman rule, particularly in the North. Students sometimes assume that the feudal system was imposed immediately and uniformly after 1066 rather than developing gradually over decades.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify that the Normans conquered England in 1066 and recall some basic facts about the period, but cannot explain the significance of the conquest or its consequences. | What happened at the Battle of Hastings in 1066? | Providing a minimal narrative without any contextual detail; Not understanding why the battle was fought or why William claimed the throne |
| **Developing** | Can describe the key features of Norman England with specific factual detail and explain how William established and maintained control after the conquest. | Explain two ways William I maintained control over England after 1066. (4 marks) | Describing methods of control without explaining why they were effective; Not recognising that Norman control was gradually established over many years, not achieved immediately |
| **Secure** | Can construct sustained analytical arguments about Norman England, explaining the interaction of political, social and religious factors and using specific evidence from the Domesday Book, the Bayeux Tapestry and other sources. | How far did the Norman Conquest transform English society? Consider both changes and continuities. (16 marks) | Treating the Norman Conquest as totally transformative without acknowledging continuities; Not using specific evidence from sources like the Domesday Book to support claims about the extent of change |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate competing interpretations of the Norman Conquest, use source evidence critically (including the Bayeux Tapestry), and assess the long-term significance of the conquest for English and British history. | The Bayeux Tapestry is often used as evidence for the Norman Conquest. Evaluate its strengths and limitations as a historical source, considering who made it, when and why. | Using the Bayeux Tapestry as straightforward evidence of events without analysing its provenance and purpose; Dismissing the Tapestry as biased rather than recognising what its bias itself reveals about Norman political culture |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *William of Normandy fought King Harold at Hastings. Harold was killed and William won and became king.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *One way was castle building. William ordered the construction of motte-and-bailey castles across England, including the Tower of London. Castles served as bases for Norman garrisons and as visible symbols of Norman power that intimidated the local English population. By 1086, over 500 castles had been built. A second way was the feudal system. William distributed land to his followers (barons) in return for military service and loyalty. This meant that the entire landowning class of England was replaced by Normans who owed their position to William personally. The feudal system created a pyramid of loyalty and obligation that extended from the king to the barons to the knights to the peasants.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *The Norman Conquest produced profound changes in English government, landholding and culture, but significant continuities persisted beneath the surface of transformation. The most dramatic change was the replacement of the Anglo-Saxon landowning elite: by 1086, the Domesday Book shows that virtually all major landholders were Norman, with only two significant English landowners remaining. This represented the largest transfer of land and wealth in English history. Government was transformed through the feudal system, castle building, and the Forest Laws, which reserved vast areas of land for royal hunting. The Church was reorganised under Norman leadership (Lanfranc as Archbishop of Canterbury), and major building programmes produced Norman cathedrals and monasteries that physically transformed the landscape. However, important continuities persisted. At the local level, English continued to be spoken by the majority population, and the administrative structures of Anglo-Saxon England — the shire system, the hundred courts, the writ system — were retained because they were more effective than anything the Normans could create from scratch. The Domesday survey itself used Anglo-Saxon administrative structures to collect its information. The English peasantry experienced a change of masters rather than a change of system: they continued to work the same land under similar conditions, with new Norman lords replacing Anglo-Saxon ones. The Conquest was therefore revolutionary at the top of society — in terms of who held power and land — but conservative at the base, where the daily structures of agricultural life changed relatively little. The most accurate characterisation is that the Normans transformed the ruling class and the cultural superstructure of English society while retaining and adapting the administrative and economic foundations they inherited.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *The Bayeux Tapestry is one of the most important primary sources for the Norman Conquest, but its strengths and limitations must be carefully evaluated. As evidence, it provides a detailed visual narrative of the events of 1064-1066, including scenes not described in any written source. Its depiction of ships, weapons, armour and battle tactics provides material evidence that written chronicles do not supply. The level of specific detail — Harold's oath to William, the death of Harold, the comet — suggests that the creators had access to eyewitness accounts or detailed oral traditions. However, the Tapestry's limitations are equally significant. It was almost certainly commissioned by Bishop Odo of Bayeux (William's half-brother) within a decade of the Conquest, making it a Norman-sponsored source that presents the Norman perspective. It depicts Harold as an oath-breaker who deserved to lose, establishing the legitimacy of William's claim. The visual medium allows ambiguity (was Harold shot in the eye, or is the figure labelled 'Harold' the one being struck down?) that has generated centuries of debate. What the Tapestry omits is as revealing as what it includes: the Harrying of the North (1069-70), which devastated northern England, is entirely absent, presumably because it would undermine the narrative of legitimate, just conquest. The most sophisticated approach treats the Tapestry not simply as evidence of what happened in 1066 but as evidence of how the Normans wanted the Conquest to be remembered and justified. Its propaganda function does not make it useless — propaganda reveals the values, anxieties and legitimation strategies of those who produced it — but it does mean that the Tapestry cannot be taken at face value as an objective account of events.*

### Secondary concept: Causation (HI-KS4-C001)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

The identification, explanation, and evaluation of the factors that caused historical events and developments. Causation involves distinguishing between multiple causes, assessing their relative importance, and understanding how causes interact over different timescales.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify one or two causes of a historical event but struggles to explain the mechanism by which causes led to outcomes or to distinguish between different types of cause. | Listing causes without explaining how they led to the outcome; Confusing background context with actual causes |
| **Developing** | Can explain multiple causes with supporting detail, distinguishing between long-term and short-term causes and beginning to explain how causes interact. | Describing causes without explaining the mechanism by which they led to the specific outcome; Not distinguishing between long-term underlying causes and short-term triggers |
| **Secure** | Can construct a sustained causal argument that categorises causes by type and timescale, explains their interaction, and evaluates their relative importance with substantiated reasoning. | Asserting that one cause was most important without comparing it to other causes; Not explaining why the economic crisis specifically benefited the Nazis rather than other parties |
| **Mastery** | Can construct a sophisticated causal argument that distinguishes between necessary and sufficient conditions, analyses the contingency of historical outcomes, and evaluates causal claims against the available evidence. | Treating the rise of Hitler as inevitable without considering counterfactual possibilities; Not distinguishing between structural conditions that made crisis likely and the specific contingent events that produced the Nazi outcome |

### Secondary concept: Consequence (HI-KS4-C002)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The identification, explanation, and evaluation of the outcomes and effects of historical events and developments. Consequence involves distinguishing between intended and unintended outcomes, immediate and long-term effects, and effects of different scale and significance.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify some outcomes of historical events but tends to focus only on immediate, obvious consequences without considering long-term effects or their relative significance. | Listing consequences without explaining their significance or scale; Focusing only on immediate effects and ignoring longer-term transformations |
| **Developing** | Can explain multiple consequences of a historical event, distinguishing between short-term and long-term effects and beginning to assess who was affected and how. | Describing consequences without specifying who was affected and how their lives changed; Not distinguishing between intended and unintended consequences |
| **Secure** | Can analyse consequences across multiple dimensions (political, social, economic), evaluate their relative significance using explicit criteria, and distinguish between intended and unintended outcomes. | Treating abolition of the trade as equivalent to the abolition of slavery itself; Not considering the consequences from the perspective of enslaved peoples as well as from the British perspective |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate the full chain of consequences flowing from a historical event, assess which consequences were most historically significant using criteria-based reasoning, and consider how the assessment of consequences changes over time. | Selecting a consequence as most significant without applying explicit criteria for comparison; Not recognising that assessments of significance change depending on the criteria used and the historical perspective adopted |

### Secondary concept: Change and Continuity (HI-KS4-C003)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The analytical framework for assessing what changed and what remained constant across historical periods. Involves identifying the nature, pace, extent, and significance of change, and explaining what factors drove or prevented it.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can recognise that things changed over time but tends to describe change as total and sudden rather than analysing its nature, pace and extent alongside what remained constant. | Presenting change as a simple before-and-after contrast without explaining the process of change; Ignoring continuities by implying everything changed at once |
| **Developing** | Can identify specific changes and continuities within a historical period, explain some factors that drove or prevented change, and recognise that change was not uniform. | Identifying change and continuity without explaining the reasons behind them; Treating all change as equally important without assessing its significance |
| **Secure** | Can construct a sustained analytical argument about the nature, pace and extent of change across a historical period, identifying turning points and periods of stagnation and evaluating what drove or prevented change. | Identifying a turning point without evaluating how quickly change actually occurred in practice; Neglecting to discuss continuities alongside changes |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate the concept of turning points critically, argue about the relative significance of different drivers of change, and assess how the pace of change was shaped by the interaction of factors such as technology, ideas, individuals, government and war. | Asserting war was the most important factor without comparing it systematically with other factors across the full timespan; Not distinguishing between wartime innovations and their subsequent implementation in peacetime medicine |

### Secondary concept: Source Analysis and Evaluation (HI-KS4-C005)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

The systematic analysis and evaluation of sources contemporary to the historical period, assessing their content, provenance, nature, and purpose to make substantiated judgements about their usefulness as historical evidence (AO3).

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can read and describe what a source says (its content) but cannot evaluate its provenance, purpose or usefulness as historical evidence. | Only describing what the source says without considering who made it and why; Taking the source at face value without considering its purpose or limitations |
| **Developing** | Can describe the content and identify the provenance of a source, and begin to explain how provenance affects the source's value as evidence, though analysis may be formulaic. | Dismissing a source as biased without explaining how the bias affects its usefulness for a specific enquiry; Not using own knowledge to support or challenge the source's claims |
| **Secure** | Can evaluate sources systematically using content, provenance and contextual knowledge, making substantiated judgements about usefulness for a specific historical enquiry and distinguishing between reliability and usefulness. | Analysing each source in isolation rather than considering what they reveal in combination; Confusing reliability (is the source accurate?) with usefulness (does the source help us understand the enquiry question?) |
| **Mastery** | Can use source analysis as a tool for constructing historical arguments, critically evaluating what sources reveal and conceal about a historical question, and understanding the epistemological challenges of reconstructing the past from incomplete and biased evidence. | Evaluating sources in isolation rather than considering how they work together and against each other; Not considering what is absent from the available evidence and what that absence reveals |

## Thinking lens: Cause and Effect (primary)

**Key question:** What caused this to happen, and how do we know?

**Why this lens fits:** The religious settlement and threats to the Crown are causal puzzles — why was a compromise settlement chosen? What caused Catholic conspiracies to intensify? What made the Armada fail? — requiring pupils to identify multiple interacting causes and evaluate their relative significance.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- Is this a necessary cause, a sufficient cause, or a contributing factor?
- What confounding variables could explain this relationship?
- How would you design an investigation to establish causation, not just correlation?
- In this causal chain, where could an intervention have the most effect?

**Secondary lens:** Perspective and Interpretation — Elizabethan depth study is distinguished by its reliance on primary source analysis — pupils evaluate the utility, reliability and provenance of a wide range of documents and images from the period, and must understand that historical knowledge of this era is constructed from partial, interested sources.

## Session structure: Case Study + Source Enquiry

This study uses 2 vehicle templates:

### Case Study (main structure)
An in-depth investigation of a specific real-world example, location, or scenario. Starts with locating and describing the case in context, collects and organises relevant data, analyses patterns and processes, compares with other cases where appropriate, and reaches an evaluative conclusion.

`locate_and_describe` → `introduction` → `data_collection` → `analysis` → `comparison` → `evaluation`

**Assessment:** Written case study report with data presentation (tables, graphs, maps), analysis of findings, and evaluative conclusion that addresses the original enquiry question.

**Teacher note:** Use the CASE STUDY template: frame the case within a broader theoretical or conceptual context. Expect pupils to select and justify appropriate data collection methods. Guide critical analysis using subject-specific frameworks and quantitative techniques where appropriate. Demand evaluative conclusions that consider the typicality of the case and the generalisability of findings.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does this case illustrate or challenge the broader theory?
- What are the strengths and weaknesses of the data collection methods used?
- To what extent can we generalise from this case study?
- How would you evaluate the significance of your findings in the wider context?

### Source Enquiry
A disciplinary history enquiry centred on working with primary and secondary sources. Pupils select relevant sources, contextualise them within their historical period, interrogate them for reliability, utility, and bias, cross-reference between sources, interpret what they reveal, and construct an argument based on the evidence.

`source_selection` → `contextualisation` → `interrogation` → `cross_referencing` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Source-based extended writing that demonstrates ability to analyse provenance, cross-reference sources, reach substantiated interpretations, and construct a historical argument.

**Teacher note:** Use the SOURCE ENQUIRY template: present a diverse source base for an exam-standard historical enquiry. Expect rigorous analysis of provenance, purpose, and historical context for each source. Demand sophisticated cross-referencing that weighs sources against each other and against contextual knowledge. Guide the construction of a sustained argument that uses evidence precisely and addresses the question directly.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does the purpose and context of this source affect its value as evidence?
- How would you weigh this source against others to assess its reliability?
- What does this source reveal when read against the wider historical context?
- How would you construct an argument that deploys source evidence precisely and addresses counter-interpretations?

## Primary sources

2 historically grounded source types are available for this study:

### 1. Bayeux Tapestry (KS3 analysis) (Primary Visual, )
See HSRC-017 for full provenance. At KS3, the Tapestry is analysed as a piece of political propaganda rather than simply as a narrative source. The Norman perspective, the selection and omission of events, and the visual rhetoric of the composition all become objects of critical analysis.

**How to use:** At KS3: focus on the propaganda dimension. Ask: 'The Tapestry was probably commissioned by William's half-brother. How does this affect what it shows?' Analyse specific scenes: 'Harold is shown swearing an oath on holy relics. Why would the Normans want to include this scene?' and 'What scenes are MISSING that Harold's supporters would have included?' This develops sophisticated source analysis skills.

**Location:** Musee de la Tapisserie de Bayeux, Bayeux, France
**URL:** https://www.bayeuxmuseum.com/en/the-bayeux-tapestry/

### 2. Domesday Book (Primary Administrative, )
A survey of English landholding commissioned by William the Conqueror in 1085 and completed in 1086. It records the ownership, value and resources of virtually every manor in England. It was compiled to establish who held what land and what taxes they owed. It is the most comprehensive administrative document to survive from medieval Europe.

**How to use:** Show a simplified Domesday entry for a local area (if available). Ask: 'Why did William want to know exactly who owned what in England?' (Control and taxation.) 'What does this tell us about the kind of ruler William was?' Then: 'Domesday Book records land and wealth, not people's feelings or beliefs. What can it tell us and what CAN'T it tell us?'

## Disciplinary concepts foregrounded

| Concept | Key question | Role in this study |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Cause and Consequence | Why did this happen, and what were the effects? | At KS4, analyse the multiple consequences of the Norman Conquest across different domains (political, social, economic, cultural, religious). Distinguish intended from unintended consequences. |
| Change and Continuity | What changed, what stayed the same, and why? | At KS4, evaluate the extent of transformation: was Norman England fundamentally different from Anglo-Saxon England, or did significant continuities persist beneath the surface? |
| Evidence and Interpretation | How do we know about this, and how do historians disagree? | At KS4, evaluate the Bayeux Tapestry and Domesday Book as historical sources: provenance, purpose, reliability. What can they tell us, and what can't they tell us? |
| Significance | Why does this matter, and to whom? | At KS4, evaluate the significance of the Norman Conquest: was it the most important event in English history? Apply significance criteria (scale, duration, number affected, commemorated). |

## Key figures and events

**Key figures:** William the Conqueror, Harold Godwinson, Odo of Bayeux, Lanfranc, Hereward the Wake

**Key events:**
- Battle of Hastings 1066
- Harrying of the North 1069-70
- Domesday Survey 1086
- Death of William I 1087
- Rebellion of 1075

**Period:** 1066 - 1100

**Perspectives to include:** Norman lord, Anglo-Saxon thegn, English peasant, Norman monk, Welsh or Scottish neighbour

**Significance claim:** The Norman Conquest was the last successful invasion of England and transformed its governance, language, architecture and social structure in ways that remain visible nearly a thousand years later.

**Historiographical debate:**
- Whether the Norman Conquest represented a sharp break from Anglo-Saxon England or built on existing structures is a long-standing historiographical debate
- Historians disagree about the Harrying of the North: military necessity or ethnic cleansing?

---

## Why this study matters

Norman England is a tightly focused 34-year depth study that enables pupils to analyse the mechanics and consequences of conquest in exceptional detail. The Bayeux Tapestry and Domesday Book provide two of the most extraordinary primary sources in British history for source evaluation work. The study connects directly to the KS3 medieval Britain unit.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Presenting the Norman Conquest as simply a change of ruler rather than analysing the systemic transformation of English society
2. Treating the Bayeux Tapestry as an objective record rather than a piece of Norman propaganda
3. Focusing exclusively on 1066 and neglecting the processes of consolidation that took decades

## Sensitive content

- The Harrying of the North involved mass destruction and famine — discuss as a historical atrocity with analytical distance
- Feudalism involved extreme social hierarchy and subjugation — discuss within historical context

---

## Historical thinking skills (KS4)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Chronological understanding** — Understand and use chronological frameworks to sequence events, periods and changes over time; develop a chronologically secure knowledge of British, local and world history using historical time vocabulary with increasing precision; construct and interpret timelines that place events in meaningful relation to each other.
- **Causation and consequence** — Understand why historical events and changes happened by identifying and explaining multiple causes; assess the intended and unintended consequences of events and decisions; distinguish between long-term structural factors and immediate triggers; construct causal arguments using historical evidence.
- **Change and continuity** — Identify what changed and what remained constant across historical periods; assess the pace, nature and extent of change; distinguish between long-term trends and short-term fluctuations; understand that change can be experienced differently by different groups within the same society.
- **Similarity and difference** — Identify and explain similarities and differences within and across historical periods, societies and cultures; avoid anachronism by understanding people's lives and choices within their own contexts; make valid comparisons that illuminate both the distinctiveness of periods and the common threads of human experience.
- **Historical significance** — Assess the significance of historical events, people and developments using explicit criteria such as scale of impact, duration, number of people affected, degree of change caused, and how an event is remembered and commemorated; understand that significance is not fixed but is constructed and contested by historians and societies over time.
- **Historical evidence** — Locate, select and use a range of primary and secondary historical sources; understand provenance and evaluate a source's utility and reliability in relation to a specific enquiry; corroborate claims across multiple sources; recognise that all sources are partial and that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
