## Enquiry questions

1. What does this site tell us about the historical period it belongs to?
2. How does the physical evidence at this site support or challenge what we know from written sources?
3. Why was this site significant to the people who used it?
4. How has the site changed over time, and what does that tell us about changing attitudes?

## Concepts

This study delivers **1 primary concept** and **4 secondary concepts**.

### Primary concept: Historic Environment Evidence (HI-KS4-C012)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The use of physical sites, buildings, and archaeological evidence as historical sources. Understanding what a site reveals about its historical period, how it has been modified over time, and how historians interpret the built and natural environment.

**Teaching guidance:** Teach students to read physical sites as historical texts: what does the design, scale, materials, and location of a building reveal about the society that created it? What functions did the site serve, and how can we tell? What has changed about the site since its historical period, and what does this tell us about subsequent attitudes to the past? For GCSE questions on the historic environment (typically the final question in the thematic study paper, testing AO1 and AO2), students need detailed factual knowledge of the specific site alongside ability to connect site features to broader historical themes. Common question formats: 'Explain how a knowledge of [site] helps us to understand [theme/period]'; 'How does the historic environment at [site] reflect the experience of [group] in [period]?'

**Key vocabulary:** historic environment, archaeological evidence, built environment, site, locality, physical evidence, preservation, reconstruction, interpretation, oral history, material culture, landscape, monument, artefact

**Common misconceptions:** Students often describe physical features of a site without explicitly connecting them to historical questions, producing narrative description rather than analytical argument. Students sometimes assume that preserved sites accurately represent their original state, without considering how sites have been modified, restored, or partially destroyed. Students confuse knowledge about a site's history with the ability to explain what the site tells us as historical evidence.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Example task | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify that historical sites exist and that they are connected to the past, but cannot explain what a site reveals as historical evidence or how historians use the built environment. | Why do historians study old buildings and historical sites? | Treating historical sites as illustrations of what we already know rather than as sources of new evidence; Not understanding the distinction between what a site tells us and what written sources tell us |
| **Developing** | Can describe features of a specific historical site and explain what they reveal about the period being studied, using factual knowledge of the period to support the explanation. | What can a Norman castle tell us about how William I controlled England after 1066? (4 marks) | Describing the features of the site without explaining what they reveal about the historical period; Not using own contextual knowledge to interpret the significance of physical features |
| **Secure** | Can analyse what a historical site reveals and conceals about its period, connecting physical evidence to broader historical themes and evaluating the site's strengths and limitations as historical evidence. | How useful is a study of Whitechapel (c1870-1900) for understanding crime and policing in Victorian Britain? (8 marks) | Describing Whitechapel's features without explicitly connecting them to what they reveal about Victorian crime and policing; Treating Whitechapel as representative of the whole of Victorian Britain without acknowledging its atypicality |
| **Mastery** | Can critically evaluate the use of physical sites as historical evidence, understanding how sites have been modified, preserved, interpreted and used politically, and can integrate site evidence into broader historical arguments. | How should historians approach the challenge that historical sites have been modified, restored and interpreted over time, rather than preserved exactly as they were? | Treating modified sites as simply 'damaged' evidence rather than as multi-layered evidence of successive historical periods; Not recognising the political and cultural purposes that shape how sites are preserved and interpreted |

> **Model response (Emerging):** *Historians study old buildings to find out what life was like in the past. Old buildings show us how people used to live.*

> **Model response (Developing):** *Norman castles tell us that William controlled England through military force and intimidation. The motte-and-bailey design allowed castles to be built quickly, showing that speed of construction was important for maintaining control across a large, potentially hostile territory. The height of the motte gave a defensive advantage and a visible symbol of Norman power over the surrounding English population. The thick stone walls of later castles (like the Tower of London) show that Norman control required permanent, fortified strongpoints, suggesting that resistance continued long after the Conquest itself.*

> **Model response (Secure):** *Whitechapel is highly useful for understanding Victorian crime and policing because it concentrates the key themes of the period in a single locality. The physical environment — overcrowded lodging houses, narrow courts, poor sanitation — illustrates the living conditions that contemporary commentators linked to crime and moral degradation. The failure of the Metropolitan Police to catch Jack the Ripper (1888) is a case study in the limitations of Victorian policing methods: lack of forensic technology, difficulty of surveillance in a densely populated area with a transient population, and the challenge of operating in a community that distrusted the police. Whitechapel's immigrant population (particularly Eastern European Jewish communities) connects to the wider theme of how crime was associated with immigration and poverty in Victorian discourse. However, Whitechapel is limited as evidence for Victorian crime more broadly because it was an extreme case: a notoriously impoverished area of London that was not representative of all Victorian communities. Crime in rural areas, middle-class areas and cities outside London would look very different. The intense media attention on the Ripper murders also distorts the picture, making violent crime appear more common than it was. The most historically productive approach is to use Whitechapel as a case study that illustrates broader themes while recognising that its extremity makes it unrepresentative of the full picture.*

> **Model response (Mastery):** *The modification and interpretation of historical sites over time is not simply a problem to be overcome but is itself historically significant evidence. Every historical site has been shaped by the decisions of successive generations about what to preserve, what to restore, what to demolish and what to interpret for visitors. A Norman castle that was modified in the Tudor period, ruined in the Civil War, romantically restored by the Victorians, and managed as a tourist attraction today reflects not one historical period but several layers of use, meaning and interpretation. This creates both challenges and opportunities for historians. The challenge is that we cannot simply 'read' a site as evidence of its original period because subsequent modifications obscure or distort original features. Archaeologists use techniques such as dendrochronology (tree-ring dating), stratigraphic analysis and material analysis to distinguish original features from later additions. The opportunity is that the layers of modification are themselves evidence: why was the site modified? What does the Victorian restoration tell us about Victorian attitudes to the medieval past? What do current heritage management decisions tell us about contemporary values? The political dimension is also important: sites are preserved and interpreted to serve present-day purposes. Battlefield sites are curated as places of remembrance; castles are presented as tourist attractions; urban heritage sites are used to regenerate neighbourhoods. These interpretive choices shape public understanding of history and should themselves be critically examined. The most sophisticated approach treats a historical site as a palimpsest — a document written over multiple times — in which each layer is historically informative and the process of layering is itself evidence of how societies relate to their past.*

### Secondary concept: Causation (HI-KS4-C001)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

The identification, explanation, and evaluation of the factors that caused historical events and developments. Causation involves distinguishing between multiple causes, assessing their relative importance, and understanding how causes interact over different timescales.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can identify one or two causes of a historical event but struggles to explain the mechanism by which causes led to outcomes or to distinguish between different types of cause. | Listing causes without explaining how they led to the outcome; Confusing background context with actual causes |
| **Developing** | Can explain multiple causes with supporting detail, distinguishing between long-term and short-term causes and beginning to explain how causes interact. | Describing causes without explaining the mechanism by which they led to the specific outcome; Not distinguishing between long-term underlying causes and short-term triggers |
| **Secure** | Can construct a sustained causal argument that categorises causes by type and timescale, explains their interaction, and evaluates their relative importance with substantiated reasoning. | Asserting that one cause was most important without comparing it to other causes; Not explaining why the economic crisis specifically benefited the Nazis rather than other parties |
| **Mastery** | Can construct a sophisticated causal argument that distinguishes between necessary and sufficient conditions, analyses the contingency of historical outcomes, and evaluates causal claims against the available evidence. | Treating the rise of Hitler as inevitable without considering counterfactual possibilities; Not distinguishing between structural conditions that made crisis likely and the specific contingent events that produced the Nazi outcome |

### Secondary concept: Change and Continuity (HI-KS4-C003)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 3/6

The analytical framework for assessing what changed and what remained constant across historical periods. Involves identifying the nature, pace, extent, and significance of change, and explaining what factors drove or prevented it.

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can recognise that things changed over time but tends to describe change as total and sudden rather than analysing its nature, pace and extent alongside what remained constant. | Presenting change as a simple before-and-after contrast without explaining the process of change; Ignoring continuities by implying everything changed at once |
| **Developing** | Can identify specific changes and continuities within a historical period, explain some factors that drove or prevented change, and recognise that change was not uniform. | Identifying change and continuity without explaining the reasons behind them; Treating all change as equally important without assessing its significance |
| **Secure** | Can construct a sustained analytical argument about the nature, pace and extent of change across a historical period, identifying turning points and periods of stagnation and evaluating what drove or prevented change. | Identifying a turning point without evaluating how quickly change actually occurred in practice; Neglecting to discuss continuities alongside changes |
| **Mastery** | Can evaluate the concept of turning points critically, argue about the relative significance of different drivers of change, and assess how the pace of change was shaped by the interaction of factors such as technology, ideas, individuals, government and war. | Asserting war was the most important factor without comparing it systematically with other factors across the full timespan; Not distinguishing between wartime innovations and their subsequent implementation in peacetime medicine |

### Secondary concept: Source Analysis and Evaluation (HI-KS4-C005)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

The systematic analysis and evaluation of sources contemporary to the historical period, assessing their content, provenance, nature, and purpose to make substantiated judgements about their usefulness as historical evidence (AO3).

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can read and describe what a source says (its content) but cannot evaluate its provenance, purpose or usefulness as historical evidence. | Only describing what the source says without considering who made it and why; Taking the source at face value without considering its purpose or limitations |
| **Developing** | Can describe the content and identify the provenance of a source, and begin to explain how provenance affects the source's value as evidence, though analysis may be formulaic. | Dismissing a source as biased without explaining how the bias affects its usefulness for a specific enquiry; Not using own knowledge to support or challenge the source's claims |
| **Secure** | Can evaluate sources systematically using content, provenance and contextual knowledge, making substantiated judgements about usefulness for a specific historical enquiry and distinguishing between reliability and usefulness. | Analysing each source in isolation rather than considering what they reveal in combination; Confusing reliability (is the source accurate?) with usefulness (does the source help us understand the enquiry question?) |
| **Mastery** | Can use source analysis as a tool for constructing historical arguments, critically evaluating what sources reveal and conceal about a historical question, and understanding the epistemological challenges of reconstructing the past from incomplete and biased evidence. | Evaluating sources in isolation rather than considering how they work together and against each other; Not considering what is absent from the available evidence and what that absence reveals |

### Secondary concept: Historical Interpretations (HI-KS4-C006)

**Type:** Skill | **Teaching weight:** 4/6

The analysis and evaluation of historians' accounts and representations of the past, assessing how and why interpretations differ and how convincing each interpretation is given the available evidence (AO4).

#### Differentiation

| Level | What success looks like | Common errors |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Emerging** | Can recognise that historians sometimes disagree about the past but treats interpretations as opinions rather than evidence-based arguments that can be evaluated. | Treating historical interpretations as matters of personal opinion rather than reasoned arguments based on evidence; Agreeing or disagreeing based on personal preference rather than on analysis of the evidence and reasoning |
| **Developing** | Can identify how two interpretations differ and suggest reasons why historians might disagree, such as having different evidence or writing at different times. | Simply describing what each interpretation says without explaining why they differ; Assuming that disagreement means one interpretation must be wrong |
| **Secure** | Can evaluate the convincingness of a historical interpretation by assessing its argument, the evidence it uses, and the evidence it omits, while recognising the legitimate reasons why interpretations differ. | Saying 'I agree' or 'I disagree' without explaining why the interpretation is or is not convincing based on evidence; Not using own contextual knowledge to test the claims made in the interpretation |
| **Mastery** | Can analyse the historiographical context of competing interpretations, understanding how changes in evidence, methodology and perspective produce different historical accounts, and can construct an independent evaluative position. | Treating changing interpretations as simply 'getting better' rather than understanding the structural reasons why interpretations change; Not connecting historiographical change to broader shifts in society, politics and methodology |

## Thinking lens: Evidence and Argument (primary)

**Key question:** What is the evidence, how reliable is it, and what conclusions can it support?

**Why this lens fits:** The historic environment study treats a physical site as primary evidence — pupils interrogate built heritage alongside documentary sources and must evaluate what the site reveals and what it conceals, constructing arguments about the period that integrate material and textual evidence.

**Question stems for KS4:**
- How does the methodology affect the strength of this evidence?
- Is this argument logically valid, regardless of whether you agree with the conclusion?
- What logical fallacy, if any, weakens this argument?
- How would you weigh these competing bodies of evidence to reach a justified conclusion?

**Secondary lens:** Cause and Effect — This cluster is the explicit conceptual introduction to causal reasoning — pupils learn the disciplinary toolkit for identifying, categorising and prioritising causes and for distinguishing short-term triggers from long-term underlying factors, which underpins all extended essay writing at GCSE.

---

## Session structure: Source Enquiry

### Source Enquiry
A disciplinary history enquiry centred on working with primary and secondary sources. Pupils select relevant sources, contextualise them within their historical period, interrogate them for reliability, utility, and bias, cross-reference between sources, interpret what they reveal, and construct an argument based on the evidence.

`source_selection` → `contextualisation` → `interrogation` → `cross_referencing` → `interpretation` → `argument`

**Assessment:** Source-based extended writing that demonstrates ability to analyse provenance, cross-reference sources, reach substantiated interpretations, and construct a historical argument.

**Teacher note:** Use the SOURCE ENQUIRY template: present a diverse source base for an exam-standard historical enquiry. Expect rigorous analysis of provenance, purpose, and historical context for each source. Demand sophisticated cross-referencing that weighs sources against each other and against contextual knowledge. Guide the construction of a sustained argument that uses evidence precisely and addresses the question directly.

**KS4 question stems:**
- How does the purpose and context of this source affect its value as evidence?
- How would you weigh this source against others to assess its reliability?
- What does this source reveal when read against the wider historical context?
- How would you construct an argument that deploys source evidence precisely and addresses counter-interpretations?

## Disciplinary concepts foregrounded

| Concept | Key question | Role in this study |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Evidence and Interpretation | How do we know about this, and how do historians disagree? | At KS4, the historic environment IS an extended evidence-and-interpretation exercise. Pupils must evaluate physical evidence for provenance, reliability and utility, then connect it to broader historical interpretations. |
| Change and Continuity | What changed, what stayed the same, and why? | At KS4, analyse how the site changed over time — what was built, modified, destroyed, preserved — and what those changes reveal about shifting attitudes and priorities. |
| Cause and Consequence | Why did this happen, and what were the effects? | At KS4, explain WHY the site was created, WHY it was significant to the people who used it, and WHAT consequences its existence had for the surrounding community. |

## Why this study matters

The historic environment is a mandatory component of GCSE History that links the thematic study to a specific physical site. It develops pupils' ability to use physical evidence (buildings, landscapes, artefacts) as historical sources and to connect site-level evidence to broader historical themes. The site changes annually (set by exam boards), ensuring fresh engagement.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

1. Treating the historic environment as a bolt-on rather than integrating it with the thematic study
2. Focusing only on describing the site rather than analysing what it reveals about the historical context
3. Neglecting to teach pupils how to use physical evidence AS a historical source (provenance, reliability, utility)

## Historical thinking skills (KS4)

These disciplinary skills should be woven through teaching, not taught in isolation:

- **Chronological understanding** — Understand and use chronological frameworks to sequence events, periods and changes over time; develop a chronologically secure knowledge of British, local and world history using historical time vocabulary with increasing precision; construct and interpret timelines that place events in meaningful relation to each other.
- **Causation and consequence** — Understand why historical events and changes happened by identifying and explaining multiple causes; assess the intended and unintended consequences of events and decisions; distinguish between long-term structural factors and immediate triggers; construct causal arguments using historical evidence.
- **Change and continuity** — Identify what changed and what remained constant across historical periods; assess the pace, nature and extent of change; distinguish between long-term trends and short-term fluctuations; understand that change can be experienced differently by different groups within the same society.
- **Similarity and difference** — Identify and explain similarities and differences within and across historical periods, societies and cultures; avoid anachronism by understanding people's lives and choices within their own contexts; make valid comparisons that illuminate both the distinctiveness of periods and the common threads of human experience.
- **Historical significance** — Assess the significance of historical events, people and developments using explicit criteria such as scale of impact, duration, number of people affected, degree of change caused, and how an event is remembered and commemorated; understand that significance is not fixed but is constructed and contested by historians and societies over time.
- **Historical evidence** — Locate, select and use a range of primary and secondary historical sources; understand provenance and evaluate a source's utility and reliability in relation to a specific enquiry; corroborate claims across multiple sources; recognise that all sources are partial and that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
