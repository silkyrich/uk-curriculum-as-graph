    "pedagogical_rationale": "Pattern seeking is the natural enquiry type for the reactivity series because pupils observe a gradient of reactivity across different metals reacting with the same acid. The pattern — from vigorous fizzing (magnesium) to no reaction (copper) — is dramatic, memorable, and demands explanation. Building the reactivity series from first-hand evidence rather than memorising a list develops genuine scientific reasoning and the skill of using observations to establish a ranking.",
    "common_pitfalls": [
      "Pupils memorise the reactivity series without understanding what it means — always link back to the practical observations",
      "Difficulty writing word equations — practise the pattern: metal + acid -> metal salt + hydrogen",
