      "pedagogical_rationale": "While Shakespeare is not statutory until KS3, the vast majority of primary schools introduce Shakespeare in Y6 as preparation for secondary school. A Midsummer Night's Dream is the most popular choice because its comedy, magic, and mistaken identity are accessible to 10-11 year olds. The performance element develops spoken language skills and confidence. Encountering Shakespearean language at Y6 reduces the anxiety of meeting it at KS3.",
