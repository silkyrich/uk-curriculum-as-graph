The statutory curriculum requires pupils to develop the habit of reading widely and often, for both pleasure and information, and to draw on their reading to inform their own writing. Pupils are expected to analyse the effect of authors' choices of structure, form, grammar and vocabulary — moving beyond identifying features to evaluating their effect on a reader. At KS3, pupils encounter canonical literary texts including novels, plays and poetry, developing a culturally rich frame of reference that prepares them for GCSE literature. Pupils also develop the critical reading skills needed to navigate and evaluate non-fiction, media and digital texts, recognising bias, perspective and rhetorical technique."

The statutory curriculum requires pupils to plan, draft, evaluate and redraft their writing, developing an understanding of the craft of writing and the recursive process of improvement through revision. Pupils are expected to develop a personal writing voice — making deliberate stylistic choices about sentence structure, vocabulary and tone — and to adapt their writing to audience, purpose and form with increasing sophistication. At KS3, pupils should extend their control of complex sentence structures, develop the ability to write coherently across multi-paragraph pieces, and use the full range of punctuation taught in primary school with accuracy and deliberate effect."

Pupils learn to deploy complex sentence structures — including relative clauses, passive constructions, modal verbs and subjunctive forms — to create specific effects in writing, and to understand how language choices reflect social context and power. The statutory curriculum requires explicit teaching of linguistic and literary terms — figurative language, metaphor, connotation, etymology, register, syntax — that equip pupils to discuss texts precisely and write about language analytically in preparation for GCSE. Pupils are also expected to extend their vocabulary systematically, learning new words from reading and understanding the principles of etymology and morphology that enable them to infer the meaning of unfamiliar words."

The statutory curriculum requires pupils to participate in structured discussions, seminars and debates — listening attentively, building on others' ideas, and developing their own position through extended oral argument. Drama and role play are used to explore characters, situations and ideas from texts studied, developing pupils' imaginative engagement and their ability to manipulate voice and gesture for communicative effect. By the end of KS3, pupils should be articulate, confident speakers who can hold their own in academic discussion and present persuasive, well-evidenced arguments orally."
