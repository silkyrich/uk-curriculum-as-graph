      "teaching_guidance": "Encourage physical activity diversity by exposing pupils to activities they may not have experienced: rowing, fencing, climbing, mountain biking, yoga, pilates, martial arts, water polo or dance styles beyond the curriculum. Use taster day formats where pupils sample multiple activities in a single day. Develop pupils' understanding of why diverse physical activity is beneficial: different activities develop different fitness components, reduce overuse injury risk, maintain motivation through variety, and provide social opportunities in different contexts. Create challenge cards where pupils track how many different activities they have tried over a term or year. Connect activity diversity to the concept of physical literacy — a physically literate person can participate confidently in many different activities. Discuss how diverse experience at school opens up lifelong activity options.",
      "key_vocabulary": "diversity, breadth, variety, physical literacy, sampling, specialisation, overuse injury, cross-training, exploration, taster session, new experience, multi-activity, lifestyle variety, interest development, well-rounded",
      "common_misconceptions": "Pupils often believe that trying many activities means they are not committed enough, when in fact broad participation at KS4 builds the physical literacy and enjoyment that sustains lifelong activity. Many think they must choose and specialise in one sport, not understanding that research supports multi-sport participation for long-term athletic development and enjoyment. Some pupils avoid new activities because they fear being a beginner, not recognising that being a beginner is a valuable learning experience that develops resilience and empathy.",
