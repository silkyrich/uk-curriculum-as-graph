      "curriculum_context": "Physical geography at GCSE begins with the most dramatic and consequential natural processes: tectonic activity and atmospheric hazards that shape landscapes and threaten human lives. The DfE GCSE Geography subject content (2014) requires study of physical geography processes including tectonic hazards, weather and climate, and climate change as core statutory content. This domain develops pupils' ability to understand physical geography at multiple scales — from plate boundary processes (global) to the impact of a specific tropical storm on a named country (regional/local) — while systematically analysing the human-physical interactions that determine why some communities are more vulnerable than others. Climate change links this domain to human geography by showing how human economic activity is itself transforming global physical systems, creating a feedback loop between the human and physical worlds that is central to contemporary geographical understanding.",

The DfE specification requires study of at least two landscape systems from: river landscapes and their management, coastal landscapes and their management, and glacial landscapes and their legacy. Studying river and coastal landscapes as systems — with inputs, processes, stores, and outputs — develops a transferable analytical framework that applies across all landscape types. Human management of these systems (flood management, coastal protection, reservoir construction) introduces the concept of physical geography as a contested space where engineering solutions have unintended consequences and where different human groups have conflicting interests. Glacial landscapes develop understanding of past climate change and its legacy in present-day landforms across much of northern Britain.",

The DfE specification requires study of urban issues in both high-income country (HIC) and low- or middle-income country (LIC/NEE) contexts, ensuring that pupils understand how urbanisation processes and urban challenges differ between the global North and South. Pupils examine the push and pull factors driving rural-urban migration, the development of slums and informal settlements, the challenge of providing urban infrastructure and services, and strategies for sustainable urban development. A named UK city case study is required, developing pupils' local geographical knowledge alongside global urban understanding.

A named LIC or NEE (newly emerging economy) case study provides depth alongside the global overview. The specification also requires study of economic change in the UK: deindustrialisation, the growth of the service sector, the knowledge economy, and the north-south divide.

The DfE specification requires overview study of global patterns of resource supply and demand for food, water, and energy, examining where resources are abundant and where they are scarce, and why demand is growing in some regions. One resource type (food, water, or energy) is then studied in depth, examining the specific challenges of supply and demand in contrasting contexts (the UK and the wider world) and evaluating strategies for more sustainable management. This domain integrates physical and human geography: physical factors (climate, geology, hydrology) determine where resources exist, while human factors (population, technology, governance, economics) determine how they are used.

For coastal management, teach the spectrum from hard engineering (sea walls, groynes, rock armour, offshore breakwaters) to soft engineering (beach nourishment, dune regeneration) to managed retreat (allowing erosion to proceed, compensating landowners).
