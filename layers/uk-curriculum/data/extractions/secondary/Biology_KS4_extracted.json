      "curriculum_context": "Cell biology is the foundation of the entire GCSE Biology specification and extends directly from the KS3 introduction to cells. Pupils move from a descriptive understanding of cell structure to a mechanistic understanding of how cells divide, specialise and exchange substances with their environment. The DfE GCSE Biology subject content requires pupils to understand the differences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells at the subcellular level, to apply quantitative microscopy including calculation of magnification, and to use the particle model to explain passive and active transport. This domain provides the conceptual framework for understanding organisation, disease, bioenergetics and genetics, making it foundational for the rest of the specification. Required practical work includes the use of microscopes to observe and draw prepared slides and the investigation of osmosis in plant tissue.",

Pupils are required by the DfE subject content to understand how the structure of the digestive system is adapted to its function, including the role of enzymes, the structure of villi and the absorption of food molecules. The cardiovascular system is studied in detail, including the structure of the heart, the distinction between arteries, veins and capillaries, and the composition and functions of blood. Plant organisation is also required, including the roles of xylem and phloem, the process of transpiration and the factors that affect it.

The DfE subject content requires pupils to understand the distinction between communicable and non-communicable diseases, to describe how specific pathogens are transmitted and cause disease in the human body, and to explain how the immune system responds to infection through phagocytosis and antibody production. The development of medicines, vaccination programmes and monoclonal antibodies represents higher-order content that requires pupils to evaluate evidence and understand the processes of clinical trials.

The DfE subject content requires pupils to describe photosynthesis as an endothermic reaction in which light energy is transferred to chemical energy in glucose, to explain the effects of temperature, light intensity and carbon dioxide concentration on the rate of photosynthesis, and to distinguish between aerobic and anaerobic respiration including the products of fermentation. Required practical work includes investigations into the factors affecting photosynthesis (using aquatic plants to measure the rate of oxygen production) and the effect of exercise on respiration.

The DfE subject content requires pupils to understand the nervous system from receptor to effector, to explain the reflex arc as a rapid automatic response, and to compare nervous and hormonal communication. Detailed content is required on the roles of insulin and glucagon in blood glucose control, ADH in water balance, and the hormones of the menstrual cycle.

The DfE subject content requires pupils to understand the structure of DNA as a double helix containing complementary base pairs, to explain how genes code for proteins through transcription and translation, and to apply Mendelian genetics to predict the outcomes of crosses using Punnett squares. Pupils are required to understand how mutations can arise and their relationship to cancer, and to explain evolution by natural selection as the mechanism by which heritable variation leads to differential survival and reproduction.

Pupils are required to understand the roles of producers, consumers and decomposers in ecosystems, and to interpret data on the effects of environmental change.

Dissolved sugars produced in photosynthesis are transported through phloem vessels by translocation. Transpiration rate is affected by light intensity, temperature, humidity, wind speed and the size and distribution of stomata.",
