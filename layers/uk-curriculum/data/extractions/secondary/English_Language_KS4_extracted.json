Reading constitutes approximately 40% of total GCSE marks. The statutory subject content requires students to read fluently and with good understanding a wide range of texts, drawing on reading across the curriculum and from wide independent reading to inform and improve their own writing. Critical reading and comprehension encompasses the ability to identify and interpret both explicit and implicit information, explain how writers use language and structural techniques to create effects, evaluate texts critically using detailed textual evidence, and compare writers' ideas and perspectives across different texts and time periods.
