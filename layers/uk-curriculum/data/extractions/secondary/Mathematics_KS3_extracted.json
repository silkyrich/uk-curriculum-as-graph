The curriculum explicitly requires that pupils can reason deductively in geometry, number and algebra, recognise when proofs are incomplete or flawed, and construct chains of reasoning to reach logical conclusions. Developing this habit of reasoning formally is preparation not only for GCSE and A-level Mathematics but for quantitative reasoning across all academic disciplines."

Pupils are expected to select from a range of mathematical techniques, recognise when approximation is appropriate, and appreciate that many problems can be solved in multiple ways. Problem solving is the overarching context in which fluency and reasoning are exercised, and the curriculum expects all three to be developed together throughout KS3."
