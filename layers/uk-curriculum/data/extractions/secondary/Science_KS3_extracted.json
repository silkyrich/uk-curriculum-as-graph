The statutory curriculum requires pupils to evaluate the reliability of their evidence, recognise sources of error and uncertainty, and communicate findings in written reports that distinguish between data and conclusions. KS3 pupils also learn to critically evaluate the work of others, reading and interpreting published scientific accounts, and understanding how scientific knowledge develops through peer review and replication.

Use it to express astronomical distances: the nearest star (Proxima Centauri) is about 4.2 light years away, the Milky Way is about 100,000 light years across, and the nearest large galaxy (Andromeda) is about 2.5 million light years away. Discuss what it means: when we look at a star 100 light years away, we see it as it was 100 years ago. Connect to the speed of light (SC-KS3-C142) and the structure of the universe (SC-KS3-C169).",
