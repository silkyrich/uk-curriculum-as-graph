Each period of British history specified in the curriculum has distinctive content: Stone Age to Iron Age covers prehistoric Britain before written records; Roman Britain examines the impact of a major empire on the British Isles; Anglo-Saxons and Vikings covers the transformative period of migration, conversion and conflict between the fifth and eleventh centuries. Pupils develop understanding of how Britain has been shaped by successive waves of migration, invasion and settlement, and how different peoples have contributed to British identity and culture.

The curriculum requires study of the earliest civilisations (with choice from Ancient Sumer, Indus Valley, Ancient Egypt, or Shang Dynasty China), Ancient Greece (as a foundational civilisation for Western culture), and a non-European society that offers significant contrast with British history - with examples given as early Islamic civilisation centred on Baghdad around 900 AD, Mayan civilisation around 900 AD, and the kingdom of Benin from around 900 to 1300 AD.

Consequence refers to the effects of events or changes - what happened as a result, both immediately and over longer periods. At KS2, pupils develop the ability to identify multiple causes and consequences for historical events, understanding that history is driven by the complex interaction of political, economic, social, religious and individual factors rather than single causes.",
      "teaching_guidance": "Teach cause and consequence explicitly as analytical concepts, not just as narrative. Use 'because' and 'therefore' to structure causal arguments. Give pupils a range of possible causes and ask them to rank or categorise them. Distinguish between long-term and immediate causes.

Significance is not fixed: what seems significant from one perspective or in one time period may appear less so from another. At KS2, pupils begin to develop explicit criteria for judging historical significance and apply them to the people and events they study.",

Evidence includes primary sources (created at the time) and secondary sources (created after the fact), each with distinctive strengths and limitations. Historians also interpret the same evidence differently based on their questions, frameworks and perspectives, which is why different historical accounts of the same events can reach different conclusions.

      "teaching_guidance": "Develop a systematic approach to source analysis: provenance (who, when, why), content (what does it say/show), utility (what can we learn from it) and reliability (how trustworthy is it and why).

They share characteristic features including writing systems, monumental architecture, complex religious and political hierarchies, specialised crafts and trade networks.

Each period represents a distinct phase in the long history of human habitation and society on the British Isles, with different peoples, technologies, political systems, religious beliefs and cultural practices.
