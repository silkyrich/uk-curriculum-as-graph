      "curriculum_context": "By the end of year 2, pupils should know the number bonds to 20 and be precise in using and understanding place value, and an emphasis on practice at this early stage will aid fluency. In Year 2, the number and place value domain consolidates and extends work from Year 1, with pupils now working confidently with numbers up to 100 in a wide range of representations and contexts. Using materials and a range of representations, pupils practise counting, reading, writing and comparing numbers to at least 100 and solving a variety of related problems to develop fluency, also counting in multiples of three to support their later understanding of a third. As they become more confident with numbers up to 100, pupils are introduced to larger numbers to develop further their recognition of patterns within the number system and represent them in different ways, including spatial representations. Pupils should partition numbers in different ways \u2014 for example, 23 = 20 + 3 and 23 = 10 + 13 \u2014 to support subtraction, and begin to understand zero as a place holder. They become fluent in applying their knowledge of numbers to reason with, discuss and solve problems that emphasise the value of each digit in two-digit numbers.",

      "curriculum_context": "In Year 2, addition and subtraction develop substantially in scope and sophistication from Year 1. Pupils extend their understanding of the language of addition and subtraction to include sum and difference, and practise addition and subtraction to 20 to become increasingly fluent in deriving related facts \u2014 for example, using 3 + 7 = 10; 10 \u2013 7 = 3 to calculate 30 + 70 = 100; 100 \u2013 70 = 30. They check their calculations by adding to check subtraction and adding numbers in a different order to check addition (for example, 5 + 2 + 1 = 1 + 5 + 2 = 1 + 2 + 5), which establishes commutativity and associativity of addition. Recording addition and subtraction in columns supports place value and prepares pupils for formal written methods with larger numbers in Key Stage 2. The statutory requirements now demand that pupils work with a two-digit number and ones, a two-digit number and tens, two two-digit numbers, and adding three one-digit numbers \u2014 a substantial progression from the within-20 focus of Year 1.",

Pupils are introduced to the multiplication tables and practise to become fluent, connecting the 2, 5 and 10 tables to each other \u2014 particularly the 10 multiplication table to place value, and the 5 multiplication table to the divisions on the clock face. They begin to use other multiplication tables and recall multiplication facts, including using related division facts to perform written and mental calculations. Pupils work with a range of materials and contexts in which multiplication and division relate to grouping and sharing discrete and continuous quantities, to arrays and to repeated addition. They begin to relate these to fractions and measures (for example, 40 \u00f7 2 = 20, 20 is a half of 40) and use commutativity and inverse relations to develop multiplicative reasoning (for example, 4 \u00d7 5 = 20 and 20 \u00f7 5 = 4). A key conceptual development is that pupils show that multiplication of two numbers can be done in any order (commutative) and division of one number by another cannot.",

      "curriculum_context": "In Year 2, fractions extend beyond the halves and quarters of Year 1 to include thirds and three-quarters, and pupils begin to write fraction notation. Pupils use fractions as 'fractions of' discrete and continuous quantities by solving problems using shapes, objects and quantities, connecting unit fractions to equal sharing and grouping, to numbers when they can be calculated, and to measures, finding fractions of lengths, quantities, sets of objects or shapes. Pupils meet 3/4 as the first example of a non-unit fraction \u2014 a fraction where the numerator is greater than 1. A significant conceptual milestone is the recognition that 2/4 and 1/2 are equivalent \u2014 the same quantity expressed in two different ways \u2014 which establishes the fundamental idea of fraction equivalence that will be central to mathematics through Key Stage 2 and beyond. Pupils should count in fractions up to 10, starting from any number and using the 1/2 and 2/4 equivalence on the number line (for example, 1 1/4, 1 2/4 (or 1 1/2), 1 3/4, 2), reinforcing the concept of fractions as numbers that can add up to more than one.",

Pupils use standard units of measurement with increasing accuracy, using their knowledge of the number system, and use appropriate language, recording using standard abbreviations (m, cm, kg, g, \u00b0C, l, ml). Comparing measures includes simple multiples such as 'half as high' and 'twice as wide', connecting measurement to multiplicative reasoning and fractions. Pupils become fluent in telling the time on analogue clocks and recording it \u2014 progressing from the hour and half past of Year 1 to five-minute intervals and quarter-past/quarter-to. In money, pupils become fluent in counting and recognising coins, read and say amounts of money confidently, and use the symbols \u00a3 and p accurately, recording pounds and pence separately. They solve simple problems in practical contexts involving addition and subtraction of money of the same unit, including giving change.

Pupils handle and name a wide variety of common 2-D and 3-D shapes including quadrilaterals and polygons, and cuboids, prisms and cones, and identify the properties of each shape \u2014 for example, number of sides, number of faces. Pupils identify, compare and sort shapes on the basis of their properties and use vocabulary precisely, such as sides, edges, vertices and faces. A new concept in Year 2 is line symmetry: pupils identify line symmetry in 2-D shapes presented in a vertical line, connecting geometric symmetry to their experience of reflection and pattern. Pupils identify 2-D shapes on the surface of 3-D shapes \u2014 for example, a circle on a cylinder and a triangle on a pyramid \u2014 making explicit the connection between 2-D and 3-D geometry.

Pupils should work with patterns of shapes, including those in different orientations, and use the concept and language of angles to describe 'turn' by applying rotations in practical contexts \u2014 for example, pupils themselves moving in turns, giving instructions to other pupils to do so, and programming robots using instructions given in right angles. The key development is that pupils now describe quarter, half and three-quarter turns not just as fractions of a full turn but specifically in terms of right angles \u2014 a quarter turn is one right angle, a half turn is two right angles, and a three-quarter turn is three right angles.

The three types of question pupils practise \u2014 counting the number of objects in each category, sorting categories by quantity, and totalling and comparing categorical data \u2014 establish the fundamental purposes of statistical inquiry: description, comparison and summary. This domain connects strongly to pupils' number knowledge (counting, comparison, addition) and to their ability to communicate mathematics through graphical representation.
