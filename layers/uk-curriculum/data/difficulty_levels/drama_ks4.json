Each room is a complete environment (a hotel lobby, a hospital ward, a ballroom) with extraordinary detail — functional taps, real medical equipment, period-accurate wallpaper. Performers move through the space; audiences follow them or explore independently. Design implications: (1) The audience becomes active — they must choose where to go, what to look at, and who to follow. This transfers agency from director to audience, creating unique individual experiences. (2) Design carries narrative — with no fixed seating and minimal dialogue, the design elements (objects, textures, spatial relationships, ambient sound) become the primary storytelling medium. A room's contents tell a story without words. (3) The boundary between set and audience space dissolves — audiences touch, sit on, and move through the design, creating a physical intimacy impossible in conventional theatre. Critique: immersive design risks prioritising spectacle over substance — the elaborate environments can become theme-park attractions rather than dramatic tools. The audience's freedom can produce confusion rather than engagement. And the individual experience model means there is no shared collective experience — the communal aspect of theatre (laughing, gasping together) is lost.

The murder of Duncan would be frightening because the audience is emotionally inside Macbeth's world. Artaud's Theatre of Cruelty seeks to assault the audience's senses, breaking through intellectual defences to reach a visceral, primal response. The fourth wall is destroyed; the audience is surrounded by the performance. For Macbeth, Artaud's approach would use extreme physicality, ritualistic movement, dissonant sound, strobe lighting, and performers moving through the audience space. The murder of Duncan would be experienced as a terrifying, ritualistic act — not psychologically realistic but sensorily overwhelming. The witches would be particularly powerful in Artaud's style — primal, physical, inhuman. Evaluation: Stanislavski's approach serves the play's psychological complexity (Macbeth's soliloquies require inner realism). Artaud's approach serves the play's supernatural and visceral elements (the witches, the dagger hallucination, the banquet scene).

Method acting (Strasberg, Adler, Meisner) adapted his early work on emotional memory, though Stanislavski himself moved away from this towards the method of physical actions. This adaptation became Hollywood's dominant approach, but it represents only one strand of Stanislavski's evolving system. Challenges: Brecht explicitly opposed Stanislavski's empathy model, arguing it produced politically passive audiences. Post-dramatic theatre (Lehmann) challenges the assumption that theatre requires characters with psychologies at all. Non-Western theatre traditions (Suzuki, Kathakali, Beijing Opera) demonstrate that codified, stylised performance systems produce powerful theatre without Stanislavski's psychological foundations. Contemporary relevance: Stanislavski's core question — 'What would I do if I were in this character's circumstances?' — remains the foundation of most screen acting and much stage acting. His emphasis on truth and specificity is timeless. However, his system was developed for 19th-century naturalistic plays; applying it uncritically to non-naturalistic, non-Western, or post-dramatic work can be limiting. The most effective contemporary practitioners (Katie Mitchell, Ivo van Hove) use Stanislavski's psychological truth within non-naturalistic staging — combining emotional specificity with formal innovation.

        "example_response": "The National Theatre's production of An Inspector Calls (directed by Stephen Daldry, designed by Ian MacNeil) interprets Priestley's play not as a drawing-room drama but as a social parable about collective responsibility. The set — a miniature Edwardian house on stilts, surrounded by a rain-soaked street populated by silent working-class figures — immediately establishes the central metaphor: the Birlings' comfortable world is literally elevated above and disconnected from the community whose exploitation sustains it. When the house cracks apart during the Inspector's revelations, the physical destruction embodies the moral collapse of the family's position. Daldry's directorial choice to begin with children playing in the street before the Birlings appear foregrounds the community the family has harmed — they are not abstract victims but visible, present individuals. Sheila's journey is staged as a literal descent from the house to the street level — her growing moral awareness is physicalised as a movement towards the working-class community. The production transforms a well-made play into an event — the audience does not simply observe the Birlings' moral failure but is implicated in the wider social structures that Priestley critiques. The design is not decorative but dramaturgical — it is the interpretation, not just its illustration.",

        "example_response": "Ivo van Hove's 2019 West End production of West Side Story divided opinion sharply. Supporters praised its visceral intensity: the removal of all scenery (replaced by a bare black box with live video close-ups projected on rear screens) stripped away the musical's 1950s nostalgia and forced audiences to confront the violence and racism without the comfort of picturesque sets. The video close-ups revealed the actors' smallest facial expressions at cinematic scale, creating an intimacy impossible in conventional musical theatre. The choice to stage 'America' as a bitter argument rather than a joyful dance number reframed the song's cultural politics. Critics argued the production sacrificed the musical's emotional warmth — Jerome Robbins' choreography was substantially reimagined, losing the balletic beauty that audiences associate with the show. The lack of scenery made transitions abrupt and some scenes spatially confusing. For some audiences, the video projections created alienation rather than intimacy — the mediation through screens paradoxically created distance in a live medium. My position: the production succeeded in making a 1957 musical feel urgent and relevant. The discomfort it created was purposeful — West Side Story's story of racialised gang violence should not feel comfortable. The video close-ups served a dramaturgical function: they revealed the humanity that distance conceals, making the final death scene devastating at a scale that conventional staging could not achieve. However, the production's relentless intensity became exhausting — the removal of the show's gentler moments ('Somewhere' was staged with stark brevity) reduced its emotional range. Great productions of musicals balance spectacle, emotion, and meaning — this production privileged meaning at the expense of emotional generosity.",
