Try: n² - n - 36 = 0. n = (1 + sqrt(145))/2 which is not an integer. This means the given probability doesn't yield a whole-number solution with 4 red counters. Adjusting: if there are 3 red counters, P = 6/(n(n-1)) = 1/3, so n(n-1) = 18. n = 4.77... Still not integer. With 4 red: if P = 2/15, then 12/(n(n-1)) = 2/15, n(n-1) = 90, n = 10. So with 10 counters total, P(two reds) = 12/90 = 2/15.
