        "example_response": "In an exothermic reaction, the energy released from forming new bonds in the products is greater than the energy needed to break bonds in the reactants. On the energy level diagram: reactants are drawn at a higher energy level than products. The downward arrow between them represents the energy released to the surroundings. The difference in height is the overall energy change. There is also a small peak above the reactants representing the activation energy \u2014 the initial energy needed to start breaking reactant bonds. For endothermic reactions, the diagram is reversed: products are higher than reactants, and the upward arrow represents energy absorbed from the surroundings. The key principle: bond breaking is always endothermic (requires energy), bond forming is always exothermic (releases energy). The overall energy change depends on which is greater.",

        "example_response": "Bonds broken (energy absorbed): 4 \u00d7 C-H = 4 \u00d7 413 = 1652 kJ; 2 \u00d7 O=O = 2 \u00d7 498 = 996 kJ. Total energy in = 2648 kJ. Bonds formed (energy released): 2 \u00d7 C=O = 2 \u00d7 805 = 1610 kJ; 4 \u00d7 O-H = 4 \u00d7 464 = 1856 kJ. Total energy out = 3466 kJ. Overall energy change = energy in - energy out = 2648 - 3466 = -818 kJ/mol. The negative sign indicates the reaction is exothermic \u2014 more energy is released forming new bonds than is required to break the old ones. This 818 kJ per mole of methane is why natural gas is used as a fuel. In reality, the value is approximately -890 kJ/mol \u2014 bond energy calculations give approximate values because bond energies are averages across different molecular environments. This calculation method is powerful because it allows prediction of energy changes for reactions that have not been performed, which is valuable in designing fuels, explosives, and industrial processes. The balance between exothermic and endothermic processes also underlies climate science \u2014 the greenhouse effect involves the balance between exothermic infrared emission from Earth and endothermic absorption by greenhouse gases.",
