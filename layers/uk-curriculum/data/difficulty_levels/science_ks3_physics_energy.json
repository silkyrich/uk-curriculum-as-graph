Reaching 100% decarbonised electricity by 2035 faces several challenges: (1) Intermittency: wind and solar output fluctuates hourly and seasonally. Solutions: grid-scale battery storage (rapidly deploying but expensive), pumped hydro storage (limited UK sites), hydrogen production (electrolysis when surplus renewable electricity is available, burned when needed), and interconnectors to import/export electricity with neighbouring countries. (2) Baseload: the grid needs reliable baseline supply. Solutions: nuclear power (Hinkley Point C under construction), tidal energy (predictable unlike wind/solar), and demand-side management (shifting energy-intensive industry to times of surplus). (3) Grid infrastructure: renewable sources are often far from demand centres (offshore wind in the North Sea, solar in southern England, demand in cities). Solutions: new high-voltage transmission lines, distributed generation (local solar), and smart grid technology. (4) Storage for 'dunkelflaute' events (extended periods of low wind and solar, especially in winter): hydrogen storage, imported interconnector electricity, and retained gas plants with carbon capture for emergency use. (5) Cost: while renewable electricity is now cheaper than fossil fuel electricity per MWh, the total system cost (including storage and grid upgrades) is higher. The technical challenges are solvable \u2014 no fundamental physics prevents a decarbonised grid \u2014 but the integration, cost, and speed of deployment are the real hurdles.",

This disordered kinetic energy is thermal energy \u2014 temperature increases. The key physics: ordered energy (all particles moving together) is being converted to disordered energy (particles vibrating randomly). This is a one-way process because the second law of thermodynamics makes it statistically virtually impossible for randomly vibrating molecules to spontaneously align their motion in one direction again. At a deeper level, friction involves the formation and breaking of temporary bonds between surface atoms (adhesion), the deformation and fracture of asperity tips, and the dragging of surface material. All of these processes convert directed kinetic energy into random thermal motion. This is why friction always produces heat \u2014 it is a fundamental consequence of converting ordered motion to disordered motion, which is an irreversible increase in entropy. This same principle explains why perpetual motion machines fail, why car brakes get hot, why meteorites burn up entering the atmosphere, and why rubbing sticks together can start a fire.",
