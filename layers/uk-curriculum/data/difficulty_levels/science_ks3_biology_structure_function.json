Second, resilience: unicellular organisms can survive extreme environments (extremophiles in hot springs, deep ocean vents, acidic lakes) that no multicellular organism can tolerate. Third, adaptability: with short generation times (some bacteria divide every 20 minutes), they evolve rapidly \u2014 this is why antibiotic resistance develops so quickly. Fourth, metabolic diversity: unicellular organisms can photosynthesise, chemosynthesise, fix nitrogen, decompose organic matter, and metabolise substances toxic to other life. Fifth, longevity: they have survived all five mass extinction events that devastated multicellular life. The 'success' of multicellularity (larger body size, cellular specialisation, complex behaviour) comes at the cost of vulnerability \u2014 multicellular organisms are more fragile, reproduce more slowly, and depend on stable environments.

Lactic acid lowers the pH inside the muscle, which interferes with the enzyme-controlled reactions of muscle contraction (specifically, it affects calcium ion release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and interferes with the binding between actin and myosin). As the quadriceps fatigue, they generate less force per contraction. The antagonistic relationship is affected because the hamstrings must now do more work to compensate \u2014 if the quadriceps cannot fully extend the knee, the stride shortens and the runner slows down.

Consequences: undigested fat passes into the large intestine, causing steatorrhoea (fatty stools), bloating, and diarrhoea.

(2) Increased diffusion distance: the remaining air spaces are larger, so gas molecules must travel further to reach capillaries. (3) Reduced blood supply: destruction of alveolar walls also destroys the capillary network surrounding them, reducing blood flow and weakening the concentration gradient. (4) Reduced elasticity: healthy alveoli are elastic, which helps push air out during exhalation. Damaged alveoli lose elasticity, trapping stale air and reducing ventilation \u2014 the concentration gradient for oxygen is therefore less steep. The combined effect is severe breathlessness, especially during exercise when oxygen demand increases.

Alcohol disrupts fetal development by interfering with cell division and differentiation, particularly in the brain and nervous system. This can cause Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), with effects including learning difficulties, behavioural problems, restricted growth, and distinctive facial features.

        "example_response": "The placenta acts as a selective barrier based primarily on molecular size and properties. Bacteria are too large (typically 1-5 \u03bcm) to cross the placental membrane. Large proteins and antibodies from the mother are generally blocked, except for IgG antibodies, which are actively transported across to provide the fetus with passive immunity. However, viruses are much smaller (typically 20-300 nm) and some can cross the placental barrier by infecting placental cells and replicating through them. Rubella virus crosses the placenta and can cause congenital rubella syndrome (deafness, heart defects, blindness) \u2014 this led to the development of the MMR vaccine and public health policy to ensure women are immune before pregnancy. Zika virus, discovered to cross the placenta in 2015-16, causes microcephaly (abnormally small head and brain). This understanding has also been exploited medically: some drugs are designed to be small enough to cross the placenta (for treating fetal conditions), while others are specifically designed to be too large to cross (for treating maternal conditions without affecting the fetus). The selectivity of the placental barrier is not perfect \u2014 it is a biological membrane evolved under selection pressure, not an engineered filter.

(2) Reduced pollen waste \u2014 pollen goes directly to another orchid of the same species, not to incompatible flowers. (3) Reproductive isolation \u2014 specialisation reduces hybridisation with related species. Risks: (1) Mutual dependency \u2014 if the wasp species declines or goes extinct (due to habitat loss, pesticide use, or climate change), the orchid cannot reproduce and faces extinction. (2) Limited range \u2014 the orchid can only survive where the wasp lives. (3) Vulnerability to disruption \u2014 any change that affects the timing of orchid flowering or wasp emergence (phenological mismatch due to climate change) can break the relationship. This illustrates a fundamental ecological principle: specialisation increases efficiency but reduces resilience. Generalist species (pollinated by many different insects) are less efficient but more resilient to environmental change.
