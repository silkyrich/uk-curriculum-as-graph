It produces a significant proportion of the world's oxygen and is home to millions of species found nowhere else. [Topic sentence establishes the subject.]\n\nDespite its importance, this vital habitat is under threat. [Cohesive adverbial 'Despite its importance' links back to paragraph 1. Synonym: 'this vital habitat' replaces 'The Amazon rainforest' to avoid repetition while maintaining the reference.] Deforestation destroys an area the size of a football pitch every minute. The trees that took centuries to grow are reduced to ash in hours. [Pronoun reference: 'The trees' refers back to the forest established in paragraph 1.]\n\nConsequently, international action is urgently needed. [Cohesive adverbial 'Consequently' signals a result of the threat described in paragraph 2.] If this destruction continues, the damage will be irreversible. It is not too late - but time is running out. [Ellipsis: 'It is not too late' implies 'to act/to save the forest' without stating it, creating urgency.]",

        "example_response": "The first paragraph ends with the key term 'inequality', which the second paragraph picks up immediately ('This inequality'). This lexical repetition acts as a thread, carrying the reader forward. The second paragraph uses 'As a result' and 'Furthermore' to build a chain of escalating consequences, each one more serious than the last - this is not just repetition of ideas but accumulation, where each consequence feeds the next.\n\nThe transition to the third paragraph uses 'It does not have to be this way', which works as a cohesive pivot: the pronoun 'it' refers back to everything described in paragraphs one and two, while 'does not have to be' signals the shift to a solution. The paragraph then mirrors the structure of paragraph two (listing three actions) but replaces negative consequences with positive proposals, creating a satisfying rhetorical balance.\n\nThe weakest transition is between paragraphs one and two. 'This inequality' is effective, but the first paragraph ends abruptly without signalling that consequences will follow. Adding a sentence like 'The effects of this are devastating' would bridge the two paragraphs more smoothly, preparing the reader for the detailed consequences that follow.",
