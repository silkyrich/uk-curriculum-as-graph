However, genes alone do not determine height. Environmental factors including nutrition, health during childhood, and socioeconomic conditions also have a significant effect. Identical twins (same DNA) raised in different environments can end up different heights, demonstrating the environmental contribution. Conversely, genetically similar populations in different nutritional environments show different average heights — average height in many countries has increased over generations due to improved nutrition, not genetic change. This gene-environment interaction applies to many human characteristics. The 'nature versus nurture' debate is often a false dichotomy — for most traits, the answer is both, interacting in complex ways.

Some non-coding DNA contains regulatory sequences (promoters, enhancers) that switch genes on and off in different cell types — which is why a liver cell and a brain cell have the same DNA but behave very differently. Some non-coding regions are involved in chromosome structure and stability. Others are remnants of ancient viral DNA or repetitive sequences whose functions are still being investigated.

Most mutations are neutral or harmful, but occasionally one provides an advantage in a particular environment. Sexual reproduction shuffles existing alleles into new combinations (through independent assortment and crossing over during meiosis), creating diversity in each generation. A species with very low genetic variation (such as cheetahs, which went through a population bottleneck) is extremely vulnerable. If a new disease emerged, all individuals would be similarly susceptible because they lack the genetic diversity for some to have resistance.

Over many generations, the beak shapes on each island diverged as different alleles were favoured in different environments. Geographic isolation (separate islands) prevented interbreeding between populations, allowing genetic differences to accumulate. Eventually, the populations became so genetically different that they could no longer interbreed even if brought together — they had become separate species. This process is called speciation (specifically, allopatric speciation because geographic isolation was involved). The evidence for this includes: (1) anatomical — beak shapes correlate precisely with diet on each island; (2) genetic — DNA analysis shows all the species are closely related but with increasing divergence; (3) observational — Peter and Rosemary Grant documented natural selection acting on beak size in real time during droughts (birds with slightly larger beaks survived better when only hard seeds were available).

Behavioural adaptation: polar bears hunt seals at breathing holes in the sea ice, waiting patiently for hours — this conserves energy in an environment where food is scarce. Functional (physiological) adaptation: polar bears can slow their metabolism during periods when food is unavailable, reducing energy needs — similar to hibernation but while remaining active. These adaptations arose through natural selection over many generations — individuals with these traits survived and reproduced more successfully in the Arctic environment.",

        "example_response": "The natural background rate of extinction is approximately 1-5 species per year. Current estimates suggest we are losing species at 100-1,000 times this rate. The primary causes are all human-driven: habitat destruction (deforestation, urbanisation, agriculture) is the most significant — it directly removes the environment organisms are adapted to. Climate change is increasingly important — temperatures are changing faster than many species can adapt through natural selection, especially long-lived species with slow reproduction rates. Overexploitation (overfishing, poaching) directly reduces populations below viable levels. Pollution (pesticides, plastics, chemical runoff) degrades habitats and harms organisms. Invasive species (introduced by human activity) outcompete native species. The key factor is speed: natural selection requires many generations to produce significant adaptation. When environmental change is gradual, populations can potentially adapt. When change is rapid (as with current human-caused changes), there is insufficient time for beneficial mutations to arise, be selected for, and spread through the population. Species with small populations, narrow habitat ranges, or slow reproductive rates are most vulnerable.",

        "example_task": "Scientists debate whether we are currently in a sixth mass extinction. What defines a mass extinction, and what evidence supports or challenges this claim?",
        "example_response": "A mass extinction is defined as the loss of more than 75% of all species within a geologically short period (typically less than 2 million years). Earth has experienced five: the Ordovician (443 Mya, ~86% species lost), Devonian (372 Mya, ~75%), Permian (252 Mya, ~96% — the 'Great Dying'), Triassic (201 Mya, ~80%), and Cretaceous (66 Mya, ~76% — including dinosaurs). Evidence supporting a sixth mass extinction: current extinction rates are 100-1,000 times the background rate; vertebrate species are declining at rates consistent with previous mass extinctions; insect populations have declined by 40-75% in some studied regions; the IUCN Red List classifies over 40,000 species as threatened. Evidence that challenges the comparison: total species loss has not yet reached 75%; mass extinctions in the fossil record took thousands to millions of years, making rate comparisons difficult; we have not yet documented extinctions of entire higher taxonomic groups (families, orders) as in previous events; and our knowledge of total species numbers is incomplete (estimated 8-10 million, only ~1.5 million described). However, many biologists argue that waiting until 75% of species are lost before declaring a mass extinction would be scientifically irresponsible — by then, it would be too late to act. The current trajectory, if unchecked, projects losses consistent with a mass extinction within centuries. Conservation strategies must address root causes: protected areas, habitat corridors, reduced consumption, climate change mitigation, and sustainable agriculture are all necessary. Single-species conservation (saving pandas) is less effective than ecosystem-level protection because it addresses symptoms rather than causes.",

Gene banks are important because they preserve genetic diversity that might otherwise be lost if species or crop varieties go extinct in the wild. This stored genetic material could be used in the future to breed disease-resistant crops, reintroduce lost species, or maintain genetic diversity in small captive populations. Biodiversity has three levels: species diversity (number of different species), genetic diversity (variation within a species), and ecosystem diversity (variety of different habitats).

It protects entire ecosystems, maintaining the complex web of relationships between species. It is generally more effective because it preserves habitats, genetic diversity, and natural behaviours, and protects many species simultaneously. Ex-situ conservation means protecting species outside their natural habitat — in zoos, botanical gardens, seed banks, and captive breeding programmes. It is essential as a last resort for critically endangered species (e.g., Arabian oryx was bred in captivity and reintroduced to the wild). However, ex-situ methods have limitations: captive populations are small (risk of inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity), animals may lose natural behaviours, and it is impossible to recreate complete ecosystems in captivity. The most effective approach combines both: protect habitats where possible (in-situ) and use captive programmes (ex-situ) as insurance for the most threatened species, with the goal of eventual reintroduction. Neither method addresses the root causes of biodiversity loss — habitat destruction, climate change, and pollution — which must also be tackled.",

These services include: provisioning services (food, fresh water, timber, medicines — over 50% of modern medicines derive from natural compounds); regulating services (pollination of crops worth hundreds of billions of pounds annually, natural flood defences from wetlands and forests, carbon sequestration by forests and oceans, air and water purification by natural systems); supporting services (nutrient cycling, soil formation — it takes hundreds of years to form a few centimetres of topsoil); and cultural services (recreation, tourism, mental health benefits from natural environments). The economic argument for conservation is compelling: the cost of replacing natural pollination with technology is estimated at far more than the cost of protecting pollinator habitats. The cost of flood damage when wetlands are drained exceeds the cost of preserving them. Once biodiversity is lost, these services must be replaced artificially — at enormous cost — or they are lost entirely. Beyond economics, there are ethical arguments: other species have intrinsic value regardless of their usefulness to humans, and we have a responsibility to future generations not to deplete the natural world irreversibly. The ecological argument is that biodiversity underpins ecosystem resilience — diverse ecosystems are better able to withstand and recover from disturbances. Reducing biodiversity makes ecosystems (and thus human systems that depend on them) more fragile. Conservation is not an alternative to economic development — it is a prerequisite for sustainable development.",
