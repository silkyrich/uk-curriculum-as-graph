When elements are arranged by atomic number, tellurium (52) correctly comes before iodine (53) with no need to swap positions. Arranging by atomic number resolves all the anomalies because chemical properties depend on electron configuration, which is determined by the number of protons (atomic number), not the total mass (which is affected by neutron number).

The irregularity prevents layers from sliding smoothly, making the alloy harder and stronger. Different amounts of carbon produce different properties: low-carbon steel (0.05-0.25% C) is relatively soft and ductile (used for car bodies); high-carbon steel (0.6-1.5% C) is very hard but brittle (used for cutting tools). Adding other elements creates specialised alloys: chromium produces stainless steel (corrosion-resistant), tungsten creates high-speed steel (maintains hardness at high temperatures for machining). The principle extends beyond steel: brass (copper + zinc) is harder than pure copper, bronze (copper + tin) is harder still, and titanium alloys (used in aircraft and medical implants) combine low density with high strength. In all cases, the alloying atoms disrupt the regular lattice, preventing easy layer sliding. This is why alloys are used in virtually all structural applications rather than pure metals \u2014 the ability to 'tune' properties by varying composition is one of the most important principles in materials engineering.",
