Critics (e.g. Stallabrass) argue that commodification neutralises dissent — political art that decorates billionaires' walls has been absorbed by the system it opposes. My position: the tension is the point. Art cannot exist outside economic systems, and demanding ideological purity is naive. What matters is whether the work shifts public discourse — and Banksy's imagery (the Calais Jungle Steve Jobs piece, the Bethlehem wall hotel) demonstrably enters mainstream debate.

More fundamentally, my gestural 30-second sketches of dancers captured movement and energy in a way that my careful observational studies could not. Different drawing modes serve different thinking purposes: sustained study builds structural understanding, gesture drawing captures kinetic energy, diagrammatic drawing analyses composition.

Mondrian's restriction to primary colours and right angles in his late work (Broadway Boogie-Woogie, 1943) creates rhythm, balance, and energy through pure formal relationships — we experience the painting as dynamic without it representing anything dynamic. In my own practice, I discovered that formal language is more culturally embedded than Kandinsky assumed: my use of red and gold, intended as warm and celebratory, was read by some viewers as referencing Chinese New Year — a cultural association I had not intended.

I combined laser-cut acrylic sheets (representing rigid societal boundaries) with hand-stitched textile elements (representing the organic, personal ways people navigate those boundaries). The acrylic is transparent, allowing layers of stitched and printed textile to show through — creating physical depth that embodies the conceptual layering. Key decisions: the scale was chosen to create an immersive relationship with the viewer (informed by my Rothko research); the material contrast was developed through extensive experimentation in Stages 3-5; the irregular stitching deliberately contrasts with the precision of the laser cutting, reflecting the tension in my theme.",

        "example_response": "My final installation uses suspended printed fabric panels viewed through a maze-like structure, creating an experience where the image fragments and recombines depending on the viewer's position. This relates to David Hockney's joiners and Cubist multiple-viewpoint composition, but translates the idea from 2D representation into 3D spatial experience. The work succeeds in communicating disorientation and partial knowledge (my theme of 'perspective') — viewers reported feeling that they could never see the complete image, which was my intention. The textile medium adds a sensory dimension (the panels move with air currents, constantly shifting) that I did not fully anticipate but which enhances the concept of instability. What I would develop: the installation requires a specific space to function — I would explore how to create a more portable version that retains the spatial experience. I would also experiment with projection onto the fabric panels to add a temporal dimension, which would connect to my research into Olafur Eliasson's light installations.",
