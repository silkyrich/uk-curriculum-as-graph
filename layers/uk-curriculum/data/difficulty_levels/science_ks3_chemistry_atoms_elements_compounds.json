IUPAC naming rules solve these problems by creating a one-to-one mapping between a chemical structure and its name. The systematic name contains the information needed to reconstruct the structure.

        "example_response": "Rf value of spot A = 7/10 = 0.70. Rf value of spot B (caffeine) = 7/10 = 0.70. Rf value of spot C (aspirin) = 4/10 = 0.40. Since spot A has the same Rf value as the caffeine standard (0.70) and is different from the aspirin standard (0.40), the unknown substance is likely caffeine, not aspirin. The matching Rf values indicate the same substance because Rf is determined by how strongly a substance interacts with the stationary phase (paper) versus the mobile phase (solvent). If spot A produced a single spot, the substance is also pure. If additional spots appeared, it would be a mixture containing caffeine plus other substances. Rf values are only valid for comparison under identical conditions (same solvent, temperature, paper type) \u2014 this is why standards must always be run alongside unknowns.",

        "example_task": "In forensic science, investigators often need to identify unknown substances found at crime scenes. Explain why multiple analytical techniques are used rather than just one.",
        "example_response": "No single analytical technique provides complete certainty of identification. Each method has limitations: melting point determination identifies purity and narrows possibilities but many substances share similar melting points \u2014 benzoic acid (122\u00b0C) and urea (133\u00b0C) are close enough that measurement error could cause confusion. Chromatography separates components and indicates identity through Rf values, but Rf values can overlap between different substances, and results depend on conditions. This is why forensic scientists use multiple complementary techniques: mass spectrometry provides the molecular mass and fragmentation pattern (a molecular fingerprint); infrared spectroscopy identifies functional groups from molecular vibrations; NMR spectroscopy reveals molecular structure; and X-ray crystallography determines the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms. Each technique provides different information, and the combination creates a highly reliable identification. In court, forensic evidence must meet legal standards of certainty \u2014 a single chromatography spot would not be sufficient, but concordant results from multiple techniques constitute strong evidence. The same principle applies in pharmaceutical quality control, environmental monitoring, and food safety testing. The concept of using multiple independent lines of evidence to build certainty is a fundamental principle of scientific investigation, not just forensics.",
