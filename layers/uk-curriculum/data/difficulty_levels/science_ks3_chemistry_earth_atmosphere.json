This is why the core is approximately 85% iron and nickel, while the crust is dominated by lighter elements (oxygen, silicon, aluminium). This layered structure means that many industrially important metals are relatively rare in the accessible crust compared to their overall abundance in the Earth. For example, iron makes up about 32% of the Earth's total mass but only 5% of the crust. Gold and platinum sank almost entirely to the core \u2014 the small amounts in the crust were deposited later by asteroid bombardment.

However, Wegener could not explain the mechanism \u2014 what force could move entire continents through the solid ocean floor? Without a mechanism, most geologists rejected the theory.

        "example_response": "Tree planting can contribute to carbon removal but has significant limitations as a standalone solution. Current human CO\u2082 emissions are approximately 36 billion tonnes per year. A mature tree absorbs roughly 22 kg of CO\u2082 per year. To offset current emissions would require approximately 1.6 trillion additional trees \u2014 about double the current global tree count. This would require an area roughly the size of the USA dedicated to new forests. Practical issues: trees take decades to reach full carbon absorption capacity; trees in temperate and boreal regions darken the land surface (reducing albedo), which can partially offset the cooling effect of CO\u2082 removal; forests are vulnerable to wildfires (which release stored carbon rapidly), disease, and climate change itself (drought killing trees); and land used for trees cannot be used for agriculture to feed a growing population. Feedback loops complicate predictions: warming thaws permafrost, releasing methane (a potent greenhouse gas) that accelerates warming further (positive feedback). Warmer oceans absorb less CO\u2082 (another positive feedback). Tree planting is valuable as part of a portfolio of solutions alongside reducing emissions (the most important action), protecting existing forests (preventing deforestation is more effective than planting new trees), technological carbon capture and storage, reducing methane emissions, and dietary change (reducing meat consumption lowers agricultural emissions). The fundamental issue is that no carbon removal strategy can compensate for continued emission increases \u2014 reducing emissions must be the priority, with carbon removal supplementing rather than replacing emission reduction.",

Greenhouse gases (CO\u2082, methane, water vapour, nitrous oxide) absorb some of this infrared radiation and re-emit it in all directions, including back towards Earth. This traps heat in the atmosphere, keeping the Earth's average temperature at approximately 15\u00b0C instead of -18\u00b0C without the greenhouse effect. This natural greenhouse effect is essential for life \u2014 without it, the Earth would be frozen. The problem is the enhanced greenhouse effect: human activities (burning fossil fuels, deforestation, agriculture) are increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, particularly CO\u2082 and methane. This traps more infrared radiation, causing global temperatures to rise. Evidence comes from ice cores (air bubbles trapped in Antarctic ice preserve atmospheric composition going back 800,000 years), direct measurements (CO\u2082 monitored at Mauna Loa since 1958 shows a steady increase), and temperature records (global average temperature has risen approximately 1.1\u00b0C since pre-industrial times).",

However, this does not undermine the case for CO\u2082 as a major climate driver. Ice core data show a strong correlation between CO\u2082 and temperature over the past 800,000 years \u2014 during ice ages, CO\u2082 was approximately 180 ppm; during warm interglacials, approximately 280 ppm. In past warm periods, CO\u2082 sometimes lagged temperature because warming was initially triggered by orbital changes, which then caused CO\u2082 release from warming oceans (a positive feedback) \u2014 the CO\u2082 then amplified the warming further. Current warming is different: CO\u2082 is rising first (driven by human emissions), and temperature is following. The physics is well-understood: CO\u2082 absorbs infrared radiation at specific wavelengths (demonstrable in a laboratory), so increasing its concentration must increase the greenhouse effect. The approximately 50% increase in CO\u2082 (from 280 to 420+ ppm) since pre-industrial times has no precedent in at least 800,000 years. The rate of change is also unprecedented \u2014 natural CO\u2082 changes typically occur over thousands of years, not decades. Multiple independent lines of evidence (rising temperatures, rising sea levels, shrinking ice sheets, ocean acidification, shifting seasons, species range changes) are all consistent with CO\u2082-driven warming.

Adaptation strategies aim to cope with the effects that are already occurring or inevitable: building flood defences and sea walls (for rising sea levels and storm surges), developing drought-resistant crop varieties (for changing rainfall patterns), improving early warning systems for extreme weather events, relocating communities from flood-prone areas, and adjusting farming practices and seasons.

Key potential tipping points include: (1) Arctic sea ice loss \u2014 as ice melts, the darker ocean surface absorbs more solar radiation (lower albedo), accelerating warming further (ice-albedo feedback). Once past a threshold, summer ice-free conditions may become permanent. (2) Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheet collapse \u2014 these contain enough ice to raise sea levels by approximately 7 m and 3 m respectively. Once melting exceeds a critical rate, gravitational and dynamic feedbacks make collapse self-sustaining. (3) Amazon rainforest dieback \u2014 warming and drought could cause the rainforest to transition to savanna, releasing billions of tonnes of stored carbon and eliminating a major carbon sink. (4) Permafrost thaw \u2014 Arctic permafrost contains approximately 1,500 billion tonnes of carbon. Thawing releases methane and CO\u2082, creating a positive feedback loop. (5) Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) slowdown \u2014 freshwater from melting ice could disrupt the ocean current system that brings warm water to Europe. Scientists are concerned because tipping points interact \u2014 crossing one could trigger others in a 'cascade', pushing the climate into a 'hothouse Earth' state that would be extremely difficult to reverse. Current estimates suggest several tipping points could be crossed between 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C of warming \u2014 a range we are approaching within decades. The non-linear nature of tipping points means that the consequences of exceeding temperature thresholds may be far more severe than gradual warming would suggest.
