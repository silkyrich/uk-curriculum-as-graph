Deliver the full teaching sequence: activate prior knowledge, present new material using appropriate representations, guide practice with immediate feedback, and assess understanding.

    "description": "AI delivers the core instructional sequence, but a non-specialist adult facilitates specific moments: setting up physical materials, observing a physical task, mediating a brief discussion, or confirming a hands-on outcome the AI cannot directly assess.",
    "agent_prompt": "You deliver the main instructional sequence for this concept. At specific points, you will pause and instruct the facilitating adult on what to set up, observe, or confirm.

The human is essential throughout — guiding discussion, reading sources together, facilitating creative tasks — but the expertise is encoded in the materials rather than requiring teacher training.",

Help the specialist teacher prepare: provide subject background, suggest lesson structures, generate differentiated resources, and offer assessment frameworks.
