  "note": "KS1/2 clusters follow NC programme of study granularity closely. KS3 domains with many concepts (Number, Algebra, Geometry) are split into 4-6 clusters using co_teach_hints as the primary grouping signal. KS4 domains are compact by design (GCSE subject content), so 2-3 clusters each. Y1 Fractions has only 2 concepts with no meaningful sub-split so treated as a single practice cluster. Several single-concept KS2 domains (Y4-D002, Y4-D007, Y4-D008, Y5-D002, Y5-D005, Y5-D007, Y5-D008) are given a single practice cluster. Y6-D004 Ratio has one concept and one cluster.",
