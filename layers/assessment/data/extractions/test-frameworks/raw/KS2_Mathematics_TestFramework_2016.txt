4 Key stage 2 mathematics test framework

1. Overview
This test framework is based on the national curriculum programme of study (2014) for
mathematics, introduced for teaching in schools from September 2014 and first assessed
in summer 2016. The framework specifies the purpose, format, content and cognitive
domains of the key stage 2 mathematics tests; it is not designed to be used to guide
teaching and learning or to inform statutory teacher assessment.
This document has been produced to aid the test development process.

1.1 Purposes of statutory assessment
The main purpose of statutory assessment is to ascertain what pupils have achieved
in relation to the attainment targets outlined in the national curriculum (2014) in
mathematics.
The main intended uses of the outcomes as set out in the Bew Report and the
Government’s consultation document on primary assessment and accountability are to:

• hold schools accountable for the attainment and progress made by their pupils
• inform parents and secondary schools about the performance of individual pupils
• enable benchmarking between schools, as well as monitoring performance locally
and nationally.

Key stage 2 mathematics test framework 5

2. What is a test framework?
The purpose of the test framework is to provide the documentation to guide the
development of the tests. The framework is written primarily for those who write test
materials and to guide subsequent development and test construction. It is being made
available to a wider audience for reasons of openness and transparency.
Some elements of the statutory national curriculum are not possible to assess using the
current form of testing; they will need to be assessed by teachers as part of their statutory
assessment of the complete national curriculum.
The framework includes those parts of the programme of study as outlined in the
national curriculum (2014) that will be covered in the test (the content domain). The
cognitive processes associated with the measurement of mathematics are also detailed in
the cognitive domain.
The test framework also includes a test specification from which valid, reliable and
comparable tests can be constructed each year. This includes specifics about test format,
question types, response types, marking and a clear test-level reporting strategy.
By providing all of this information in a single document, the test framework answers
questions about what the test will cover, and how, in a clear and concise manner.
The framework does not provide information on how teachers should teach the
national curriculum.
The test development process used by the Standards and Testing Agency (STA) embeds
within it the generation of validity and reliability evidence through expert review and
trialling. Given the nature of the evidence collected, it is not anticipated that any additional
studies will be required in order to demonstrate that the tests are fit for purpose. The test
framework does not provide detail of the validity and reliability of individual tests; this will
be provided in the test handbook, which will be published on the DfE’s website following
the administration of the test.
The test framework should be used in conjunction with the national curriculum (2014) and
the annual ‘Assessment and reporting arrangements’ (ARA) document.

6 Key stage 2 mathematics test framework

3. Nature of the test
The key stage 2 mathematics test forms part of the statutory assessment arrangements
for pupils at the end of key stage 2.
The test is based on the relevant sections of the national curriculum statutory programme
of study (2014) for mathematics at key stage 2.
The test will cover the aspects of the curriculum that lend themselves to paper-based,
externally marked testing.

3.1 Population to be assessed
All eligible pupils who are registered at maintained schools, special schools or academies
(including free schools) in England and are at the end of key stage 2 will be required to take
the key stage 2 mathematics test, unless they have taken it in the past.
Some pupils are exempt from the tests. Further details are in the ARA, which can be found
on the GOV.UK website at www.gov.uk/sta.

3.2 Test format
The key stage 2 mathematics test comprises two components, which will be presented to
pupils as three separate test papers. The first component is an arithmetic paper. The second
component is administered as two papers; there are no significant differences in format
between the two papers. The test is administered on paper and the total testing time is 110
minutes.

3.3 Resource list
The resource list for the mathematics tests comprises:

• Paper 1: arithmetic – a blue/black pen or a dark pencil; ruler; rubber (optional).
• Paper 2 and Paper 3: mathematical reasoning – a blue/black pen or a dark

pencil; a sharp, dark pencil for mathematical drawing; ruler (showing centimetres
and millimetres); angle measurer or protractor; mirror; rubber (optional).

4. Content domain
The content domain sets out the relevant elements from the national curriculum
programme of study (2014) for mathematics at key stage 2 that are assessed in the
mathematics test. The tests will, over time, sample from each area of the content domain.
The content domain also identifies elements of the programme of study that cannot
be assessed in the key stage 2 tests (section 4.3). Attainment in these elements will be
monitored through teacher assessment.
Tables 2 and 3 detail content from the national curriculum (2014). Elements from the
curriculum are ordered to show progression across the years. The curriculum has been
grouped into subdomains and these are detailed in the ‘strand’ column.

4.1 Content domain referencing system
A referencing system is used in the content domain to indicate the year, the strand and the
substrand, for example ‘3N1’ equates to:

• year – 3
• strand – Number and place value
• substrand – 1.
Table 2 shows the references for the strands and substrands and Table 3 shows the
progression across the years.

4.3 Elements of the national curriculum that cannot
be assessed fully
The table below identifies areas that are difficult to fully assess in a paper-based format.
Some of the points below may be partially assessed.
Table 4: Elements of the curriculum that cannot be assessed fully
Content domain reference

Explanation

3C1, 5C1, 4C6, 5C5c, 5C6a, 6C6 and
6F11 – mental arithmetic skills

Mental mathematics skills cannot be directly
assessed in a paper-based test since only the pupil’s
responses can be marked. For questions where only
the answer is recorded, it is not possible to know
the method that the pupil used or how quickly he
or she completed the question.
Pupils who are fluent with numbers will be able to
use their mental arithmetic skills to find efficient
strategies for completing calculations under test
conditions. Therefore, good mental arithmetic
skills will enable pupils to recall and apply number
knowledge rapidly and accurately.

5. Cognitive domain
The cognitive domain seeks to make the thinking skills and intellectual processes required
for the key stage 2 mathematics test explicit. Each question will be rated against the four
strands of the cognitive domain listed in sections 5.1 to 5.4 below to provide an indication
of the cognitive demand.
The cognitive domain will be used during test development to ensure comparability of
demand as well as difficulty for tests in successive years. The national curriculum (2014)
aims of solving mathematical problems, fluency and mathematical reasoning are reflected
within the cognitive domain.

5.1 Depth of understanding
This strand is used to assess the demand associated with recalling facts and using procedures to
solve problems.
Questions requiring less depth of understanding require simple procedural knowledge,
such as the quick and accurate recall of mathematical facts or the application of a single
procedure to solve a problem.
At intermediate levels of demand, a question may require the interpretation of a problem
or application of facts and procedures. However, the component parts of these questions
are simple and the links between the parts and processes are clear.
At a high level of demand, a greater depth of understanding is expected. Questions may
require that facts and procedures will need to be used flexibly and creatively to find a
solution to the problem.

30 Key stage 2 mathematics test framework

5.2 Computational complexity
This strand is used to assess the computational demand of problems.
In questions with low complexity, there will be no numeric operation.
In questions with lower complexity, it is likely that a one-step process such as recalling a
mathematical fact or the application of a simple procedure will be sufficient to solve
the problem.
At an intermediate level of complexity, more than one numeric step or computation will be
needed to solve the problem.
At a high level of complexity, questions will have multiple numeric steps or computations
and the links between them within the problem will be complex.

5.3 Spatial reasoning and data interpretation
This strand is used to assess the demand associated with the representation of geometrical
problems involving 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional shapes and position and movement. This
strand is also used to assess the demand associated with interpreting data presented in tables,
pictograms, charts and graphs.
There is a low level of demand when all of the resources or information required to answer
the question are presented within the problem (e.g. finding the perimeter of a shape by
adding the length of the sides).
At intermediate levels of demand, spatial reasoning will be needed to manipulate the
information presented in the question to solve the problem (e.g. reflect a polygon in a
mirror line). Pupils may need to select the appropriate information in order to complete the
problem (e.g. from a table, chart or graph).
At the highest level of demand, there may be the need to use complex spatial reasoning
to interpret, infer or generate new information from that given before the problem can
be completed (such as identifying 3-dimensional characteristics from 2-dimensional
representations or making inferences from the given information).

5.4 Response strategy
This strand describes the demand associated with constructing a response to a question.
At a low level of demand, the strategy for solving a problem is given as part of the
presentation of the problem.
At a lower intermediate level of demand, the strategy for answering a problem is clear
and following simple steps will lead to completion of the problem. Some reasoned
construction may be associated with organising appropriate working.
At an upper intermediate level of demand, there may be the need to construct a
straightforward response. Some reasoned construction may be associated with organising
more complex working.
At a high level of demand, the question will require that a strategy is developed and
monitored to complete the task. The answer may need to be constructed, organised and
reasoned.

6.2 Breadth and emphasis
The content and cognitive domains for the mathematics tests are specified in sections
4 and 5. The test will sample from the content domain in any given year. Although every
element may not be included within each test, the full range of content detailed in this
document will be assessed over time. Consolidation of the key stage 1 material is assumed
within the key stage 2 programme of study and therefore material from key stage 1
may appear within the key stage 2 test. The questions in each test will be placed in an
approximate order of difficulty.
The following sections show the proportion of marks attributed to each of the areas of the
content and cognitive domains in a test.

* In any one year the test will include category 4 questions from at least 3 of the 4 strands.

6.3 Format of questions and responses
6.3.1 Paper 1
Paper 1 (arithmetic) will comprise constructed response questions, presented as contextfree calculations. The majority of the arithmetic calculations will be worth one mark.
However, two marks will be available for long multiplication and long division.

6.3.2 Papers 2 and 3
In Papers 2 and 3, mathematical problems are presented in a wide range of formats to
ensure pupils can fully demonstrate mathematical fluency, mathematical problem solving
and mathematical reasoning.
Papers 2 and 3 will include both selected response and constructed response questions.
Selected response questions, where pupils are required to select which option satisfies the
constraint given in the question, will include question types such as:

• multiple choice, where pupils are required to select their response from the
options given
• matching, where pupils are expected to indicate which options match correctly
• true / false or yes / no questions, where pupils are expected to choose one
response for each statement or problem.

Constructed response questions, where pupils are required to construct an answer rather
than simply select one or more options, will include the following:

• constrained questions, where pupils are required to provide a single or best

answer; these might involve giving the answer to a calculation, completing a chart
or table, or drawing a shape (for questions worth more than one mark, partial
credit will be available)

• less constrained questions, where pupils are required to communicate their
approach to evaluating a statement or problem.

36 Key stage 2 mathematics test framework

Questions in Papers 2 and 3 comprise both those presented in context and out of context.
Up to 50 per cent of marks across these papers will be set in context.

6.4 Marking and mark schemes
The tests will be externally marked on screen by trained markers.
The mark schemes will give specific guidance for the marking of each question, together
with general principles to ensure consistency of marking.
The mark schemes will provide the total number of marks available for each question
and the criteria by which markers should award the marks to pupils’ responses. Where
multiple correct answers are possible, examples of different types of correct answer will be
given in the mark schemes. Where applicable, additional guidance will indicate minimally
acceptable responses and unacceptable responses. The mark schemes will provide a
content domain reference, so it is possible to determine what is assessed in each question.
For all questions, the mark schemes will be developed during the test development
process and will combine the expectations of experts with examples of pupils’ responses
obtained during trialling.
For multi-mark questions, where the correct answer has not been obtained, the mark
scheme will indicate where marks are awarded either for using a formal method (Paper 1)
or for correctly following a process or processes through the problem (Papers 2 and 3).
Partial marks will be awarded for correct working where the final answer is wrong but
the pupil has used the formal method of working; where the grid method has been used
for long multiplication or the ‘chunking’ method for long division, partial marks will not
be awarded.

6.5 Reporting
The raw score on the test (the total marks achieved out of the 110 marks available)
will be converted into a scaled score. Translating raw scores into scaled scores ensures
performance can be reported on a consistent scale for all pupils. Scaled scores retain the
same meaning from one year to the next. Therefore, a particular scaled score reflects the
same standard of attainment in one year as in the previous year, having been adjusted for
any differences in difficulty of the test.
Additionally, each pupil will receive an overall result indicating whether or not he or
she has achieved the required standard on the test. A standard-setting exercise will be
conducted on the first live test in 2016 in order to determine the scaled score needed for
a pupil to be considered to have met the standard. This process will be facilitated by the
performance descriptor in section 6.7 which defines the performance level required to
meet the standard. In subsequent years, the standard will be maintained using appropriate
statistical methods to translate raw scores on a new test into scaled scores with an
additional judgemental exercise at the expected standard. The scaled score required to
achieve the expected standard on the test will always remain the same.

Key stage 2 mathematics test framework 37

6.6 Desired psychometric properties
While the focus of the outcome of the test will be whether a pupil has achieved the
expected standard, the test must measure pupils’ ability across the spectrum of attainment.
As a result, the test must aim to minimise the standard error of measurement at every point
on the reporting scale, particularly around the expected standard threshold.
The provision of a scaled score will aid in the interpretation of pupils’ performance over
time as the scaled score that represents the expected standard will be the same year-onyear. However, at the extremes of the scaled score distribution, as is standard practice,
the scores will be truncated such that above and below a certain point, all pupils will be
awarded the same scaled score in order to minimise the effect for pupils at the ends of the
distribution, where the test is not measuring optimally.

6.7 Performance descriptor
This performance descriptor describes the typical characteristics of pupils whose
performance in the key stage 2 tests is at the threshold of the expected standard. Pupils
who achieve the expected standard in the tests have demonstrated sufficient knowledge
to be well-placed to succeed in the next phase of their education, having studied the
full key stage 2 programme of study in mathematics. This performance descriptor will
be used by a panel of teachers to set the standards on the new tests following their first
administration in May 2016. It is not intended to be used to support teacher assessment
since it reflects only the elements of the programme of study that can be assessed in a
paper-based test (see the content domain in section 4).

6.7.1 Overview
Pupils working at the expected standard will be able to engage with all questions within
the test. However, they will not always achieve full marks on each question, particularly if
working at the threshold of the expected standard.
Questions will range from those requiring recall of facts or application of learned
procedures to those requiring understanding of how to use facts and procedures creatively
to decide how to solve complex and unfamiliar problems. There will be a variety of question
formats including selected response, short answer and more complex calculations and
explanations where the demonstration of an appropriate method may be rewarded.
Question difficulty will be affected by the strands of the cognitive domain such as
computational complexity and spatial reasoning and data interpretation. This should be
borne in mind when considering the remainder of this performance descriptor, since pupils
working at the threshold of the expected standard may not give totally accurate or correct
responses to questions. In cases where there are multiple interrelated computational steps
and / or a need to infer new information or to visualise or represent an abstract problem,
some pupils may find the question difficult to understand, especially in a test setting. This
will be true even when the performance descriptor determines that a skill should be within
the pupil’s capacity if working at the expected standard.

38 Key stage 2 mathematics test framework

The following sections describe the typical characteristics of pupils in Year 6 working at
the threshold of the expected standard. It is recognised that different pupils will exhibit
different strengths, so this is intended as a general guide rather than a prescriptive list.
References in square brackets [ ] refer to aspects of the content domain as specified in
section 4.

6.7.2 Number, ratio and algebra
Pupils working at the expected standard are able to:

• use place value in whole numbers up to 1,000,000 to compare and order numbers
and are beginning to become confident with numbers up to 10,000,000 [N2, N3]
• round any whole number to the nearest power of ten [N4]
• use negative numbers in practical contexts such as temperature and calculate
intervals across zero [N5]
• count forwards or backwards in steps of any whole number with one significant
figure, e.g. 9, 20, 3,000 [N1] to generate, describe and complete linear number
sequences [A3]

• recognise and use multiples, factors, prime numbers less than 20 and square
numbers up to 144 [C5]
• add and subtract whole numbers with up to two significant figures (e.g. 95 + 36,
5,700 – 2,900) [C1]
• add and subtract whole numbers with more than four digits, using formal written
methods where appropriate [C2]
and
• use their understanding of place value to multiply and divide whole numbers÷ 100
=
decimals with up to two decimal places by 10 or 100 (e.g. 1,532 ÷ 100 = ,
6.3) [C6]

• multiply and divide whole numbers mentally drawing upon multiplication facts up
to 12 × 12 and place value (e.g. 60 × 70) and begin to use these facts to work with
larger numbers [C6]

• multiply numbers with up to two digits by a two digit number using the formal

long multiplication method and becoming more confident with multiplication
with larger numbers; multiply and divide numbers with up to four digits by a single
digit number using the formal short division method and become more confident
with division using larger numbers including the long division method. [C7]

• use simple ratio to compare quantities (e.g. Every pupil is given 3 pencils and a pen.

36 pencils were given out. How many pens were needed?) and estimate the distance
from a map using a simple scale (e.g. where 1 cm represents 100 m) [R1, R3]

• use simple formulae expressed in words (e.g. time needed to cook a chicken: allow
20 minutes plus 40 minutes per kilogram) [A2]
• find possible values in missing number problems involving one or two unknowns
(algebra) (e.g. Ben thinks of two numbers: the sum of the two numbers is 10:
multiplied together they make 24: what are Ben’s numbers? > (a + b=10, ab=24)
[A1, A4].

6.7.3 Measurement
Pupils working at the expected standard are able to:

• read, write and convert time between analogue (including clock faces using

Roman numerals) and digital 12- and 24- hour clocks, using a.m. and p.m. where
necessary [M4]

• calculate the duration of an event using appropriate units of time (e.g. A film starts
at 6:45p.m. and finishes at 8:05p.m. How long did it last?) [M4]
• convert between ‘adjacent’ metric units of measure for length, capacity and mass
(e.g. 1.2 kg = 1,200 g; how many 200 ml cups can be filled from a 2-litre bottle?;
write 605 cm in metres) [M5]

• find the perimeter of compound shapes when all side lengths are known or can be
easily determined (e.g. a simple shape made from two identical rectangles joined
together to make an L-shape with given dimensions of the rectangle) [M7]

of squares and rectangles including using standard
• calculate and compare the area) and
square metres (m ) and estimate the area of
units, square centimetres (cm2
irregular shapes by counting squares [M7].

6.7.4 Geometry
Pupils working at the expected standard are able to:

• compare and classify 3-D and 2-D shapes based on their properties (e.g. for 2–D

shapes: parallel sides, length of sides, type and size of angles [G4], reflective
symmetry [G2], regular / irregular polygons [G2]; for 3-D shapes: faces, vertices and
edges) [G2]

• recognise and describe simple 3-D shapes, including using nets and other 2-D
representations [G3]
• complete simple shapes using given lengths, such as 7.5 cm, (accurate to +/−2 mm)
and acute angles that are multiples of 5° (accurate to +/– 2°) [G3]

40 Key stage 2 mathematics test framework

• know and use the facts that angles at a point sum to 360°, angles at a point on a
straight line sum to 180° and angles in a triangle sum to 180° (e.g. calculate the
base angles of an isosceles triangle where the other angle is 110°) and identify
other multiples of 90° [G4]

• identify, describe; and represent the position of a shape following a reflection or
translation [P2]
• describe positions on a 2-D co-ordinate grid using axes with equal scales in the

first quadrant (in the context of number or geometry) and use co-ordinates to
complete a given rectangle; become more confident in plotting points in all four
quadrants [P3].

6.7.5 Statistics
Pupils working at the expected standard are able to:

• complete, read and interpret information presented in tables and bar charts (e.g.
find the difference between two bars showing temperatures, where one is 20°C
and the other is 13°C, on a scale labelled in multiples of 5) [S1]

• interpret line graphs (e.g. begin to find the difference between two temperatures
on a line graph, where one is 20°C and the other is 13°C, on a scale labelled in
multiples of 5) and simple pie charts (e.g. a pie chart cut into eight pieces for
favourite fruit using whole numbers for each section) [S1]

the mean as an average for simple sets of discrete data (e.g. find the
• calculate
mean mass of three parcels weighing 5 kg, 3 kg and 10 kg) [S3].

6.7.6 Solving problems and reason mathematically
Pupils working at the expected standard are able to:

• solve mathematical problems by applying their mathematics to a variety of routine
and non-routine problems, in a range of contexts (including money and measures,
geometry and statistics) using the content described above

• begin to reason mathematically making simple generalisations, using
mathematical language
• use and interpret mathematical symbols and diagrams, and present information
and results in a clear and organised way; for example:
• solve mathematical problems with two or three computational steps using

addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and a combination of
these (e.g. extract and add prices from a table and calculate change, or solve
problems such as ‘Jason bought some bags of green apples (6 for 75p) and
some bags of red apples (10 for 90p). He spent £4.20. How many bags of each
type of apple did he buy?’) [C4, C8]

• solve mathematical problems involving numbers with up to two decimal

places (e.g. find the two numbers which sum to 10 from this list: 0.01, 0.11,
1.01, 9.09, 9.9, 9.99) [F10, M9]

• make simple connections between mathematical ideas
• solve mathematical problems involving data [S2].

7. Diversity and inclusion
The Equality Act 2010 sets out the principles by which the national curriculum assessment
and associated development activities are conducted. During the development of the
tests, STA’s test development division will make provision to overcome barriers to fair
assessment for individuals and groups wherever possible.
National curriculum tests will also meet Ofqual’s core regulatory criteria. One of the criteria
refers to the need for assessment procedures to minimise bias: ‘The assessment should
minimise bias, differentiating only on the basis of each learner’s ability to meet national
curriculum requirements’ (Regulatory framework for national assessment, published by
Ofqual 2011).
The end of key stage 2 mathematics test should:

• use appropriate means to allow all pupils to demonstrate their mathematical
fluency, solving problems and reasoning
• provide a suitable challenge for all pupils and give every pupil the opportunity to
achieve as high a standard as possible
• provide opportunities for all pupils to achieve, irrespective of gender, disability or
special educational need, social, linguistic or cultural backgrounds
• use materials that are familiar to pupils and for which they are adequately prepared
• not be detrimental to pupils’ self-esteem or confidence
• be free from stereotyping and discrimination in any form.
The test development process uses the principles of universal design, as described in the
‘Guidance on the principles of language accessibility in national curriculum assessments’
(New language accessibility guidance, published by Ofqual 2012).
In order to improve general accessibility for all pupils, where possible, questions will be
placed in order of difficulty. As with all national curriculum tests, attempts have been made
to make the question rubric as accessible as possible for all pupils, including those who
experience reading and processing difficulties, and those for whom English is an additional
language, while maintaining an appropriate level of demand to adequately assess the
content. This includes applying the principles of plain English and universal design
wherever possible, conducting interviews with pupils, and taking into account feedback
from expert reviewers.
For each test in development, expert opinions on specific questions are gathered, for
example, at inclusion panel meetings, which are attended by experts and practitioners
from across the fields of disabilities and special educational needs. This provides an
opportunity for some questions to be amended or removed in response to concerns raised.
Issues likely to be encountered by pupils with specific learning difficulties have been
considered in detail. Where possible, features of questions that lead to construct irrelevant
variance (for example, question formats and presentational features) have been considered
and questions have been presented in line with best practice for dyslexia and other specific
learning difficulties.

Appendix: Glossary of terminology used in
the test framework
cognitive domain

Cognitive processes refer to the thinking skills and intellectual
processes that occur in response to a stimulus. The cognitive domain
makes explicit the thinking skills associated with an assessment.
The cognitive domain, as shown in this framework, also identifies
other factors that may influence the difficulty of the questions.

component

A section of a test, presented to pupils as a test paper or test
booklet is called a component. Some tests may have two or more
components that each pupil needs to sit to complete the test.

construct irrelevant
variance

Construct irrelevant variance is the variation in pupils’ test scores
that does not come from their knowledge of the content domain. It
can result in pupils gaining fewer marks than their knowledge would
suggest or lead to the award of more marks than their knowledge
alone would deserve.
The former can occur, for example, when questions in a mathematics
test also unintentionally measure reading ability. The latter often
occurs when unintended clues within questions allow pupils to
answer correctly without having the required subject knowledge.

content domain

The body of subject knowledge to be assessed by the test

distribution

The range of possible scaled scores

domain

The codified definition of a body of skills and knowledge

mark scheme

The document explaining the creditworthy responses or the criteria
that must be applied to award the mark for a question in the test

national curriculum
programme of study

The national curriculum programme of study is the statutory
description of subject knowledge, skills and understanding for a
given key stage. The key stage 1 and 2 programmes of study are
published online at:
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculumin-england-primary-curriculum

performance
descriptor

A performance descriptor is a description of the typical
characteristics of pupils working at a particular standard. For these
tests, the performance descriptor will characterise the minimum
performance required to be working at the appropriate standard for
the end of the key stage.

44 Key stage 2 mathematics test framework

raw score

A raw score is the unmodified score achieved on a test, following
marking. In the case of these tests it is the total marks achieved.
For example, if a pupil scores 27 out of 60 possible marks, the raw
score is 27. Raw scores are often then converted to other measures
such as percentile ranks, standardised scores or grades.

scaled score

A score which has been translated from a raw score into a score on a
fixed, defined scale is a scaled score. This allows performance to be
reported on a consistent scale for all pupils, which retains the same
meaning from one year to the next. Therefore, a particular scaled
score reflects the same level of attainment in one year as in the
previous year, having been adjusted for any differences in difficulty
of the specific tests.

standard

The required level of attainment in order to be classified into a
particular performance category

standard error of
measurement

The standard error of measurement is a reliability estimate that
allows the user to determine a confidence interval around a test
score. It is a measure of the distribution of scores that would be
attained by a pupil had that pupil taken the test repeatedly under
the same conditions.

standard setting

The process of applying the standard to a particular test to
determine the score required for a pupil to be classified within a
particular performance category

test framework

A document that sets out the principles, rationale and key
information about the test, and containing a test specification

test specification

A detailed description of what is to be included in a test in any single
cycle of development

truncate

To shorten by removing ends
