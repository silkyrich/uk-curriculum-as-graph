## Overview

The Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) sets standards for the learning, development and care of children from birth to 5 years old. It is statutory for all maintained schools, non-maintained schools, independent schools, and all providers on the Early Years Register.

The EYFS is structured around:
- **4 overarching principles** that shape practice
- **7 areas of learning and development** (3 prime + 4 specific)
- **17 Early Learning Goals (ELGs)** defining expected attainment at end of Reception
- **Assessment requirements** including the EYFS Profile

---

## Overarching Principles

Four guiding principles shape practice in early years settings:

1. **Every child is a unique child** who is constantly learning and can be resilient, capable, confident and self-assured
2. **Children learn to be strong and independent** through positive relationships
3. **Children learn and develop well in enabling environments** with teaching and support from adults, who respond to their individual interests and needs, and help them to build their learning over time
4. **Children develop and learn at different rates** — the framework covers the education and care of all children including those with SEND

## Seven Areas of Learning and Development

### Prime Areas

The three prime areas are particularly important for building a foundation for igniting children's curiosity and enthusiasm for learning, forming relationships and thriving. Research shows these are time-sensitive — if not achieved by age 5, they are much harder to achieve later.

#### 1. Communication and Language

The development of children's spoken language underpins all seven areas of learning and development. Children's back-and-forth interactions from an early age form the foundations for language and cognitive development. The number and quality of conversations children have with adults and peers throughout the day in a language-rich environment is crucial.

**Educational programme:** Practitioners must provide opportunities for children to speak and listen in a range of situations and to develop their confidence and skills in expressing themselves.

#### 2. Personal, Social and Emotional Development (PSED)

Crucial for children to lead healthy and happy lives, and fundamental to their cognitive development. Underpinning their personal development are the important attachments that shape their social world. Strong, warm and supportive relationships with adults enable children to learn how to understand their own feelings and those of others.

**Educational programme:** Practitioners must provide support for children to manage emotions, develop a positive sense of self, set simple goals, have confidence in their own abilities, persist and wait for what they want, and direct attention as necessary.

#### 3. Physical Development

Vital to children's all-round development, enabling them to pursue happy, healthy and active lives. Gross and fine motor experiences develop incrementally throughout early childhood, starting with sensory explorations and the development of a child's strength, co-ordination and positional awareness through tummy time, crawling and play movement.

**Educational programme:** Practitioners must provide opportunities for play both indoors and outdoors, and activities that develop fine and gross motor skills and hand-eye co-ordination.

### Specific Areas

The four specific areas strengthen and apply the three prime areas.

#### 4. Literacy

Development of a lifelong love of reading. Reading consists of two dimensions: language comprehension and word reading. It is important that children develop their word reading and comprehension skills together. Skilled word reading involves both the speedy working out of the pronunciation of unfamiliar printed words (decoding) and the speedy recognition of familiar printed words.

**Educational programme:** Practitioners must provide opportunities for children to link sounds and letters and to begin to read and write. Children must be given access to a wide range of reading materials to ignite their interest.

#### 5. Mathematics

Developing a strong grounding in number is essential so that all children develop the necessary building blocks to excel mathematically. Children should be able to count confidently, develop a deep understanding of the numbers to 10, the relationships between them and the patterns within those numbers.

**Educational programme:** Practitioners must provide children with opportunities to develop and improve their skills in counting, understanding and using numbers, calculating simple addition and subtraction problems, and describing shapes, spaces and measures.

#### 6. Understanding the World

Involves guiding children to make sense of their physical world and their community. The frequency and range of children's personal experiences increases their knowledge and sense of the world around them — from visiting parks, libraries and museums to meeting important members of society.

**Educational programme:** Practitioners must guide children to make sense of their physical world and their community through opportunities to explore, observe and find out about people, places, technology and the environment.

#### 7. Expressive Arts and Design

The development of children's artistic and cultural awareness supports their imagination and creativity. It is important that children have regular opportunities to engage with the arts, enabling them to explore and play with a wide range of media and materials. The quality and variety of what children see, hear and participate in is crucial.

**Educational programme:** Practitioners must provide children with opportunities to explore and share their thoughts, ideas and feelings through a variety of activities in art, music, movement, dance, role-play, and design and technology.

## The 17 Early Learning Goals (ELGs)

The ELGs define the level of development children should be expected to have attained by the end of the EYFS (typically end of Reception year, age 5).

**Important:** The ELGs should not be used as a curriculum or in any way to limit the wide variety of rich experiences that are crucial to child development. They support practitioners to make a holistic, best-fit judgement about a child's development and readiness for Year 1.

### PRIME AREAS

#### Communication and Language

**ELG 1: Listening, Attention and Understanding**
Children at the expected level of development will:
- Listen attentively and respond to what they hear with relevant questions, comments and actions when being read to and during whole class discussions and small group interactions
- Make comments about what they have heard and ask questions to clarify their understanding
- Hold conversation when engaged in back-and-forth exchanges with their teachers and peers

**ELG 2: Speaking**
Children at the expected level of development will:
- Participate in small group, class and one-to-one discussions, offering their own ideas, using recently introduced vocabulary
- Offer explanations for why things might happen, making use of recently introduced vocabulary from stories, non-fiction, rhymes and poems when appropriate
- Express their ideas and feelings about their experiences using full sentences, including use of past, present and future tenses and making use of conjunctions, with modelling and support from their teacher

## Assessment

### EYFS Profile

The EYFS Profile is a statutory assessment completed by Reception teachers at the end of the school year in which a child turns 5. For each of the 17 ELGs, teachers assess whether a child's development is:
- **Expected** — meeting the ELG criteria
- **Emerging** — not yet reaching the expected level

Assessment is based on ongoing observation and professional judgement, not formal testing.

### Good Level of Development (GLD)

A child achieves a Good Level of Development if they reach the **expected** level in all 12 ELGs across the 5 areas of:
1. Communication and Language (ELGs 1-2)
2. Personal, Social and Emotional Development (ELGs 3-5)
3. Physical Development (ELGs 6-7)
4. Literacy (ELGs 8-10)
5. Mathematics (ELGs 11-12)

Note: Understanding the World and Expressive Arts and Design (ELGs 13-17) are **not** included in the GLD calculation.

**National GLD statistics (2024/25):** 68.3% of children achieved a good level of development.

### Progress Check at Age 2

Between ages 2-3, practitioners must review children's progress and provide parents with a short written summary focusing on the three prime areas.

## Development Matters (Non-statutory Guidance)

**URL:** https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/development-matters--2
**PDF:** https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/64e6002a20ae890014f26cbc/DfE_Development_Matters_Report_Sep2023.pdf

Development Matters is non-statutory curriculum guidance published by the DfE, developed by Dr Julian Grenier. It provides a framework for practitioners to plan and assess children's learning from birth to the end of Reception.

### Age Bands (revised 2021)

The 2021 revision reduced the number of age ranges to three broad bands:
1. **Birth to 3** — earliest development
2. **3 and 4 year olds** — pre-school / nursery
3. **Children in Reception** — the year before Year 1

This is a deliberate simplification from the previous six age bands, recognising that children develop at different rates and reducing tracking pressure on practitioners.

### Relationship to ELGs

Development Matters provides progression statements for each area of learning across the three age bands, leading towards the ELGs. Practitioners working with children below Reception age do not need to use the ELGs directly.
