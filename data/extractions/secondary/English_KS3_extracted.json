The statutory curriculum requires pupils to develop the habit of reading widely and often, for both pleasure and information, and to draw on their reading to inform their own writing. Pupils are expected to analyse the effect of authors' choices of structure, form, grammar and vocabulary \u2014 moving beyond identifying features to evaluating their effect on a reader. At KS3, pupils encounter canonical literary texts including novels, plays and poetry, developing a culturally rich frame of reference that prepares them for GCSE literature. Pupils also develop the critical reading skills needed to navigate and evaluate non-fiction, media and digital texts, recognising bias, perspective and rhetorical technique."

Pupils are expected to develop a personal writing voice \u2014 making deliberate stylistic choices about sentence structure, vocabulary and tone \u2014 and to adapt their writing to audience, purpose and form with increasing sophistication. At KS3, pupils should extend their control of complex sentence structures, develop the ability to write coherently across multi-paragraph pieces, and use the full range of punctuation taught in primary school with accuracy and deliberate effect."

The statutory curriculum requires explicit teaching of linguistic and literary terms \u2014 figurative language, metaphor, connotation, etymology, register, syntax \u2014 that equip pupils to discuss texts precisely and write about language analytically in preparation for GCSE.

Drama and role play are used to explore characters, situations and ideas from texts studied, developing pupils' imaginative engagement and their ability to manipulate voice and gesture for communicative effect.
