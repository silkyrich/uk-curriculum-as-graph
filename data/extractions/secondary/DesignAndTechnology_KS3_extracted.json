This autonomy marks a significant shift from KS2, where the design brief was typically provided. Pupils are expected to conduct in-depth research and exploration - including user research, existing product analysis, material investigation and contextual study - to identify authentic user needs and opportunities. Design specification becomes more rigorous, articulating measurable criteria against which final products can be evaluated. Communication through multiple representational modes, including annotated sketches, formal technical drawings, scale models, 3D computer modelling and mathematical modelling of structural or mechanical properties, equips pupils with the full toolkit of professional designers.",

The curriculum acknowledges that design and making are iterative rather than sequential: pupils are expected to adapt and modify their designs during making as problems are encountered and solutions are discovered.

Most significantly, evaluation at KS3 is expected to engage with the broader consequences of design decisions: the ethical implications of product use, the environmental impact of materials and manufacturing processes, and the social consequences of design choices.

Electrical and electronic systems extend to programmable microcontrollers and sensors, enabling pupils to design products with embedded intelligence that can sense, process and respond to their environment.

It involves deep empathy with users, structured research methods (interviews, observation, surveys, prototyping), iterative testing with real users, and continuous refinement based on user feedback. At KS3, pupils develop understanding of user-centred design as a distinct and powerful approach that produces solutions better suited to genuine human needs than solutions derived purely from technical or aesthetic assumptions.",

Set projects where pupils must engage with real potential users before and during the design process. Teach prototyping as a user testing tool, not just a making exercise.

Study how manufacturing processes alter properties: how does heat treatment change metal? How does grain direction affect wood?
