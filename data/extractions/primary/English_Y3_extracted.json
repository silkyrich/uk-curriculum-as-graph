The statutory curriculum requires all spoken language objectives to be developed continuously throughout the primary years, with teachers providing rich opportunities for debate, drama, collaborative discussion and formal presentation.

The statutory curriculum requires pupils to read most words fluently without needing to sound them out, and to re-read texts for accuracy and comprehension, self-correcting where necessary.

The statutory curriculum includes specific statutory word lists for Years 3 and 4 that pupils are expected to learn, covering common exception words not decodable by standard phonics rules.

The statutory curriculum introduces pupils to new grammatical terms: fronted adverbial, determiner, pronoun, possessive pronoun, and adverbial. The teaching of grammar at this stage is always embedded in meaningful writing contexts, with pupils learning to use new structures not just to recognise them, and evaluating the effect of grammatical choices on the reader."
