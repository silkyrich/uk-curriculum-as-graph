The statutory curriculum requires that pupils speak clearly and convey their ideas confidently, using language imaginatively to give well-structured descriptions, explanations and narratives. Pupils are expected to listen carefully to what others say, ask relevant questions to extend understanding, and build vocabulary through exposure to a wide range of spoken language including poetry, stories and non-fiction. Opportunities for drama, role play and structured talk are essential at KS1 so that children develop the oral fluency that provides the basis for composition in writing. Spoken language objectives apply across all years of primary school and should be developed continuously."

The statutory curriculum requires that by the end of Year 1, children pass the statutory Phonics Screening Check, demonstrating secure knowledge of the common grapheme-phoneme correspondences. In Year 2, pupils consolidate their phonic knowledge and develop fluency in reading high-frequency words and common exception words. The goal of word reading is automaticity \u2014 reading words accurately without conscious effort \u2014 which frees pupils' cognitive resources for comprehension."

Pupils learn to discuss words and phrases that capture their interest or imagination, and to recite poems by heart.

Pupils learn to spell common exception words (those that do not follow regular phonics patterns), the days of the week, and an increasing range of words with common suffixes and prefixes. The statutory curriculum requires pupils to apply the rules of adding common suffixes (-s, -es, -ing, -ed, -er, -est), to use apostrophes correctly for contractions, and to distinguish between homophones and near-homophones. Developing accurate spelling frees children's attention for the compositional aspects of writing, which is why transcription skills \u2014 spelling and handwriting \u2014 are given explicit statutory attention separate from composition."

The statutory curriculum requires pupils to form capital letters correctly, write digits, and understand which letters are 'ascenders' and 'descenders'. By Year 2, pupils should begin to use joined handwriting where it is appropriate, and should sit correctly at the desk using the correct grip.

The statutory curriculum requires pupils to write sentences that are sequenced to form short narratives, and to use features of different text types including stories, poems, recounts and instructions.

The statutory curriculum introduces pupils to the grammatical terms noun, noun phrase, adjective, verb, tense, adverb and conjunction, using these as metalinguistic tools to improve their writing. By Year 2, pupils are expected to use coordination and subordination to write complex sentences, and to use commas in lists and apostrophes for contraction. The teaching of grammar is always in service of writing improvement, not an end in itself."
