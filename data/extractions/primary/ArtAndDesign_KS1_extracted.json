Pupils explore how different materials behave and how techniques such as drawing, painting and sculpture can be used to express ideas, experiences and imagination. The educational rationale is to build foundational practical skills and creative confidence at an early age, establishing habits of experimentation and creative risk-taking. Pupils develop physical dexterity and learn to communicate meaning through visual and tactile media, working across two-dimensional and three-dimensional forms. This domain underpins all subsequent art and design learning by establishing that making is a central act of creativity.",

By exploring colour mixing, pattern-making, texture exploration, line quality, and the use of shape, form and space, pupils begin to understand how artists construct meaning and effect. Teaching in this domain helps pupils name and articulate what they see and make, developing the language of art and design. Pupils investigate how changing one element, such as line weight or colour saturation, transforms the mood and impact of a work. This foundational knowledge of visual elements supports pupils in both making their own work and discussing the work of others.",

Pupils study a range of artists, craft makers and designers, comparing and contrasting different practices and traditions. They begin to make connections between what they observe in the work of others and their own creative choices. The educational rationale is that encountering exemplary work inspires pupils and gives them a richer sense of the possibilities available to them as creators.

Pupils learn that choosing an appropriate material is part of the creative process and that materials can be combined, transformed and manipulated. Experimenting with materials builds both practical skill and creative understanding.",

At KS1, pupils develop confidence in mark-making and begin to use drawing purposefully to record, explore and communicate. Drawing underpins many other art and design activities.",
      "teaching_guidance": "Provide a variety of drawing tools including pencils, crayons, felt tips, chalk and charcoal. Encourage observational drawing from objects, natural forms and still life. Use drawing as a thinking tool - ask pupils to draw their ideas before making. Explore mark-making through rubbings, printing and gestural mark-making. Display pupils' drawings prominently to validate this form of expression.",

      "description": "Painting involves applying colour to a surface using brushes or other tools to create images and expressions. At KS1, pupils explore colour mixing, brush control and different ways of applying paint. Painting develops understanding of colour as a visual element and builds physical skill and creative confidence.",
      "teaching_guidance": "Use powder paint, ready-mixed paint and watercolours. Teach primary colour mixing to create secondary colours and explore tints and shades by adding white and black. Vary brush sizes and types, and also explore painting with sponges, rollers and fingers. Connect painting to observation, imagination and response to the work of artists. Allow experimentation with layering and mark-making with paint.",

      "common_misconceptions": "Pupils often believe colours cannot be changed once mixed. Systematic colour mixing activities address this. Some pupils may be overly cautious with paint; activities that reward bold mark-making help build confidence. Pupils may not connect paint colour choices to emotional or expressive intent.",

      "description": "Sculpture involves creating three-dimensional forms using a range of materials such as clay, wire, card, found objects and natural materials. At KS1, pupils explore how forms can be constructed, modelled, assembled and manipulated to create objects that exist in space. Three-dimensional work develops spatial awareness, tactile sensitivity and understanding of form.",
      "teaching_guidance": "Use air-drying clay for modelling activities, exploring pinching, rolling, coiling and slab-building techniques. Use reclaimed materials for construction and assemblage projects. Explore natural materials for temporary sculpture and installation. Discuss the work of sculptors such as Barbara Hepworth or Andy Goldsworthy. Help pupils consider how their sculpture will look from multiple viewpoints.",

      "common_misconceptions": "Pupils may think of sculpture only as large monuments. Exploring small-scale, handmade and ephemeral sculpture broadens this understanding. Some pupils may struggle with the non-permanence of clay work before firing; discussing transformation and process is important.",

      "concept_name": "Visual Elements: Colour, Pattern, Texture, Line, Shape, Form and Space",
      "description": "The formal elements of art are the building blocks used by artists to construct visual compositions and communicate meaning. Colour carries emotional associations and creates harmony or contrast. Pattern involves repetition of motifs. Texture describes the surface quality of a material. Line can be expressive, directional or descriptive. Shape is two-dimensional and form is three-dimensional. Space refers to areas within and around forms. Understanding these elements gives pupils both a creative toolkit and a vocabulary for discussing art.",
      "teaching_guidance": "Teach each element through dedicated activities and then reinforce in wider projects. Use colour wheels to explore colour relationships. Create repeating pattern designs inspired by textiles, tiles or natural forms. Explore texture through rubbings, collage and paint applications. Make observational drawings focusing specifically on line or shape. Discuss how artists have used these elements purposefully by examining real works of art.",
      "key_vocabulary": "colour, hue, tone, pattern, repeat, motif, texture, rough, smooth, line, thick, thin, curved, shape, form, space, composition",
      "common_misconceptions": "Pupils may use formal elements without awareness of how they create effect. Moving from unconscious use to intentional choice is a key progression. Pupils sometimes confuse shape (2D) and form (3D); consistent and explicit use of these terms helps. Pattern may be seen as mere decoration rather than a structural principle.",

      "description": "Knowledge of practitioners in art, craft and design gives pupils models of creative practice, historical context and cultural diversity. At KS1, pupils learn that different people make different things in different ways and for different purposes, and that these practices have histories and traditions. Comparing the work of different practitioners develops critical and analytical vocabulary.",
      "teaching_guidance": "Introduce a diverse range of artists, craft makers and designers including those from different cultures, genders, historical periods and disciplines. Use high-quality reproductions and, where possible, real objects. Ask pupils to describe what they see, what they think the artist was trying to do, and what connections they can make to their own work. Use artists as starting points for pupils' own making activities. Include craft makers such as potters and textile artists alongside fine artists.",

      "common_misconceptions": "Pupils often begin with a narrow view of who artists are and what art looks like. Deliberately including diverse examples challenges this. Some pupils may find it difficult to connect what they see in an artist's work to their own making; structured links through projects and activities help build this bridge.",
