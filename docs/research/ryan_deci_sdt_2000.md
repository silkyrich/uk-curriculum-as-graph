## Summary
This paper presents the core theoretical architecture of Self-Determination Theory (SDT), the most robustly evidenced motivational framework in education and psychology. Ryan and Deci synthesise decades of experimental and cross-cultural research establishing three universal basic psychological needs — autonomy, competence, and relatedness — and describe how social environments can either support or undermine intrinsic motivation through their impact on these needs. The paper distinguishes intrinsic motivation from different types of extrinsic motivation on a continuum from external regulation to full integration.

## Key findings
- SDT posits three universal basic psychological needs: Autonomy (feeling volitional control over one's actions), Competence (feeling effective and capable), Relatedness (feeling connected to others)
- Intrinsic motivation: behaviour performed for its own sake; extrinsic motivation: continuum from external regulation to identified regulation to integrated regulation
- "The more internalized the extrinsic motivation, the more autonomous the person" — extrinsic motivation can become self-determined through internalisation
- Social environments fundamentally shape motivational patterns; controlling environments undermine intrinsic motivation even for activities the learner initially found engaging
- Supporting all three needs enhances performance, persistence, creativity, and wellbeing
- Informational feedback (acknowledging competence) supports intrinsic motivation; controlling feedback (demanding performance improvement) undermines it
- Cross-cultural evidence across decades confirms the universality of the three-need structure
- Extrinsic controls including visible performance tracking, comparative ranking, and mandatory incentive systems suppress intrinsic motivation

## Direct quotes
From the briefing summary based on SDT website and paper summary:

"The more internalized the extrinsic motivation, the more autonomous the person."

"Environments supporting all three needs produce higher intrinsic motivation, deeper learning, and better wellbeing." (Briefing paraphrase)

"Informational feedback (you-did-this-well) supports competence and is motivationally safe; controlling feedback (you-must-do-better) is damaging." (Briefing interpretation)

## Relevance to platform
SDT provides the theoretical foundation for the platform's most distinctive design decisions: removing visible progress bars (removes controlling feedback), removing leaderboards (removes social comparison that undermines autonomy), and designing AI encouragement as informational ("you worked hard on that") rather than controlling ("you need to reach the next level") — the distinction is well-evidenced and directly actionable.
