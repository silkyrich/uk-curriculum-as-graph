## Summary
Carnegie Learning's research page summarises the evidence base for its MATHia adaptive learning platform and related products (ClearMath Elementary, Lenses on Literature). Carnegie Learning is the commercial descendant of the Carnegie Mellon Cognitive Tutor research programme, which pioneered the use of ACT-R cognitive theory, model tracing, and BKT in adaptive mathematics tutoring. The flagship evidence claim is a RAND Corporation study characterised as "Gold Standard" showing that a blended human-plus-MATHia approach nearly doubled learning growth in Year 2 of implementation.

## Key findings
- RAND study (funded by US Department of Education, described as "Gold Standard"): blended approach (MATHia plus teacher instruction) nearly doubled learning growth on standardised tests in Year 2 of implementation
- ClearMath Elementary: 4.9 additional months of learning annually, 41% above national expectations in independent evaluation
- Lenses on Literature (literacy product): 4–9 months of additional learning per year; described as closing achievement gaps
- EMERALDS Study: greater number of MATHia workspaces completed in middle school correlated with better Algebra I outcomes; effect stronger for low-prior-attainment students
- Evidence standards: blended implementation (MATHia + teacher) = ESSA Tier 1 "Strong Evidence"; MATHia standalone = ESSA Tier 2 "Moderate Evidence"
- The Year 1 / Year 2 distinction is important: the blended approach produced larger gains in Year 2, suggesting that implementation quality and teacher familiarity are significant moderators

## Direct quotes
From the briefing summary based on page access:

"RAND study: blended approach nearly doubled learning growth in Year 2"

"EMERALDS Study: more MATHia workspaces in middle school → better Algebra I; effect stronger for low scorers"

"Blended = ESSA Tier 1 'Strong'; MATHia standalone = ESSA Tier 2 'Moderate'"

## Relevance to platform
The Year 2 implementation effect and the stronger outcomes for low-prior-attainment students in the EMERALDS study both point toward the same design principle: prerequisite-gated sequencing (ensuring foundational concepts are mastered before advancing) produces disproportionate gains for students who have gaps, which is exactly what the Neo4j outer-fringe approach is designed to achieve.
