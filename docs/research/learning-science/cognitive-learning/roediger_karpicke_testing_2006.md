## Summary
Roediger and Karpicke's 2006 paper is the canonical modern demonstration of the testing effect (also called the retrieval practice effect): retrieval of information from memory strengthens that memory more than re-studying the same information does, even when the retrieval attempt is failed. The study compared a read-study condition, a repeated-study condition, and a read-test condition across multiple delay intervals (five minutes, two days, one week). The testing condition produced equivalent or worse immediate recall but substantially superior delayed recall — confirming that retrieval practice benefits manifest most at meaningful retention intervals.

## Key findings
- Retrieval from memory strengthens it more than re-studying, even when the test is failed
- Effect is strongest at delayed tests (days or weeks later); re-studying produces equivalent performance on immediate tests but substantially worse on delayed tests
- The mechanism is the strengthening of retrieval routes, not just re-encoding of content
- A 2019 review in *Psychological Science in the Public Interest* confirmed the testing effect as one of the most replicable findings in cognitive psychology
- Post-error correction (showing the correct answer with explanation immediately after a wrong response) should be standard; it adds the encoding benefit of the error while correcting the memory trace
- Most edtech platforms use retrieval as assessment (to measure mastery) rather than as the primary learning mechanism; this is a missed opportunity

## Direct quotes
From the briefing summary:

"Retrieval from memory strengthens it more than re-study, even when test is failed."

"Delayed tests show largest effect; post-error correction should be standard."

"Retrieval is the learning — frequent, low-stakes, spaced testing drives long-term retention better than explanatory content." (Briefing design principle)

## Relevance to platform
Every question the platform asks is a retrieval practice event that drives learning, not merely an assessment event that measures it; the knowledge tracing model should treat a failed retrieval attempt as a learning event (not just a failure signal), and immediate post-error correction with explanation should be standard after every incorrect response, not optional.
