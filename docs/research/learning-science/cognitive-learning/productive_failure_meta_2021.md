## Summary
Sinha and Kapur's 2021 meta-analysis is the definitive quantitative synthesis of Productive Failure (PF) research. Productive Failure is the counter-intuitive instructional sequence where students attempt to solve a problem using their own methods before receiving instruction — they typically fail or produce suboptimal solutions, but the subsequent instruction produces substantially deeper conceptual understanding and transfer compared with the standard instruction-before-practice sequence. The meta-analysis examined 53 studies with 166 comparisons.

## Key findings
- 53 studies, 166 comparisons included in the meta-analysis
- Cohen's d = 0.36 overall in favour of problem-before-instruction (PF) over direct instruction first
- At high fidelity to PF design principles, Cohen's d = 0.58 — approximately 3x a typical teacher year effect
- Effect is robust across mathematics and physics; evidence is sparse outside STEM
- The mechanism: initial failed attempts activate prior knowledge, generate awareness of knowledge gaps, and prepare cognitive "slots" for incoming instruction; students who struggle first are primed to learn the canonical solution more deeply
- Most adaptive platforms invert this sequence: MATHia, ALEKS, and Khan Academy all deliver worked examples or explanation before asking students to apply them
- The PF sequence is not a contradiction of worked example effects; it is used to prime conceptual understanding before canonical instruction, not to replace instruction

## Direct quotes
From the briefing summary:

"Cohen's d = 0.36 in favour of problem-before-instruction; at high fidelity d = 0.58; ~3x typical teacher year effect."

"Most adaptive platforms invert this sequence." (Briefing observation)

"Initial failed attempts activate prior knowledge, generate awareness of knowledge gaps, and prepare cognitive 'slots' for incoming instruction." (Briefing paraphrase)

## Relevance to platform
For conceptual knowledge components, the platform should sequence exploration before exposition: before introducing a concept through instruction, surface a challenge problem and let the student attempt it, fail, and explore; the prerequisite graph determines when a student is sufficiently prepared to productively fail on a new concept — they need prerequisite concepts mastered but not the target concept — making this a Cypher-queryable sequencing decision.
