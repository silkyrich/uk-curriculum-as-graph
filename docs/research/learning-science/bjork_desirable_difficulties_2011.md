## Summary
This chapter from the Bjork lab synthesises the concept of "desirable difficulties" — conditions that impede immediate performance but yield superior long-term learning and retention. The key paradox articulated is that the conditions which feel most productive during learning (massed practice, immediate feedback, blocked problem sets) often produce the worst long-term retention, while the conditions that feel harder and less productive during learning (spacing, interleaving, reduced feedback) produce the best long-term outcomes. The chapter covers spacing, interleaving, and retrieval practice as the three most robustly supported desirable difficulties.

## Key findings
- Desirable difficulties: conditions that slow immediate learning but yield superior long-term retention
- Spacing effect: distributed practice over time substantially outperforms massed (cramming) practice; described as one of the most replicated findings in psychology
- Interleaving: mixing problem types within a session outperforms blocked practice (all of one type, then all of another) on delayed tests, despite lower performance during the practice itself
- Retrieval practice: testing outperforms restudying for long-term retention; retrieval strengthens memory traces more than re-encoding
- Key paradox: conditions producing best immediate performance often yield worst long-term retention
- Learners intuitively prefer massed, blocked practice because it produces misleading fluency cues — it feels like more is being learned
- Quantified spacing effect: distributing practice across days produces retention 10–30% better than massing equivalent practice time
- Quantified interleaving effect: interleaved mixed problem sets outperform blocked practice by 30–40% on delayed tests

## Direct quotes
From the briefing summary based on Bjork lab page and paper summary:

"Desirable difficulties = conditions that impede immediate performance but yield superior long-term learning."

"Students and teachers typically prefer blocked, massed practice because it feels more productive in the moment." (Briefing paraphrase)

"Learners intuitively prefer massed practice despite spacing's documented superiority (misleading fluency cues)."

## Relevance to platform
The problem sequencing algorithm should implement spaced review (SM-2 or FSRS algorithm for spacing intervals), interleaved within-session problem sets (mixing recent mastery reviews with new concept work), and the AI encouragement layer should explicitly contextualise the difficulty of interleaved sessions ("You're tackling different types of problems — that's what actually makes you better") to prevent the fluency paradox from causing frustration or disengagement.
