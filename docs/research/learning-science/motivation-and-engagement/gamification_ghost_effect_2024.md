## Summary
This paper introduces and analyses the "ghost effect" in gamified educational settings: students who are physically present in gamified learning environments but mentally absent, going through gamified motions without genuine cognitive engagement. The authors examine the conditions under which gamification backfires, identify which student populations are harmed, and make recommendations for adaptive personalised approaches that avoid the pathological outcomes of conventional gamification.

## Key findings
- "Ghost students" are physically present but mentally absent — a paradoxical outcome of gamification where the reward mechanics themselves crowd out learning
- Points and badges encourage surface-level, perfunctory engagement and undermine intrinsic motivation
- Competitive gamification (leaderboards, visible ranking) demoralises lower-performing students, reduces self-efficacy, and can produce learned helplessness
- Extraverted students tend to benefit from competitive gamification; introverted students experience increased social pressure and anxiety — a personality-moderated effect
- Over-reliance on immediate rewards weakens students' capacity for self-directed inquiry and tolerating productive difficulty
- Recommendations from the paper: adaptive personalised gamification tailored to individual profiles, prioritise intrinsic over extrinsic motivation design, use AI-driven difficulty adjustment to keep students in the challenge zone
- Aligns with the broader gamification literature: a 2022 systematic mapping in *Information and Software Technology* reviewed 87 papers finding undesired effects, with badges and leaderboards as the most consistently negative elements

## Direct quotes
"Ghost students — physically present, mentally absent — a paradoxical outcome of gamification."

"Points and badges undermine intrinsic motivation, encourage surface-level understanding."

"Competitive gamification demoralises struggling students, reduces self-efficacy."

"Extraverted students benefit; introverted students experience increased pressure."

## Relevance to platform
This paper provides the most specific recent evidence base for the platform's decision to remove all gamification elements (no visible progress bars, no leaderboards, no badges); the ghost effect concept is directly applicable to a platform serving children across attainment ranges, and the recommendation to use unexpected AI-driven encouragement rather than competitive scoring aligns precisely with the platform's semi-random delight moment design.
