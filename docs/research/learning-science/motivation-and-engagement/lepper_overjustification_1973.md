## Summary
The Lepper, Greene and Nisbett (1973) study is the foundational experimental demonstration of the overjustification effect: when children who already find an activity intrinsically interesting are given an expected, tangible reward for engaging in it, their subsequent intrinsic interest in that activity reliably declines after the reward is withdrawn. The study used drawing as the target activity, randomly assigning children to expected reward, unexpected reward, and no reward conditions. Only children in the expected reward condition showed reduced intrinsic motivation — a finding that has been replicated and meta-analytically confirmed across decades.

## Key findings
- Expected, tangible rewards for activities a learner already finds intrinsically interesting reliably undermine subsequent intrinsic motivation (the overjustification effect)
- Effect is specific to rewards that are: (a) expected before the activity begins, and (b) tangible (physical rewards, points, badges, prizes)
- Unexpected rewards given after task completion do NOT produce the overjustification effect — the mechanism requires anticipation of reward
- Informational feedback acknowledging competence ("you solved that elegantly") does NOT produce the overjustification effect and can increase intrinsic motivation
- Meta-analytic confirmation: Deci et al. (1999) and Cameron & Pierce (1994) both confirm the pattern, with some disagreement on boundary conditions
- The mechanism: when an external reward is provided for an intrinsically interesting activity, the learner attributes their participation to the reward rather than intrinsic interest — their self-perception of motivation shifts

## Direct quotes
From the briefing summary:

"Expected tangible rewards for intrinsically interesting activities reliably undermine that motivation."

"Unexpected rewards given after task completion do NOT produce this effect."

"Informational competence feedback does NOT produce this effect."

"The design is doing the right things for the right reasons." (Briefing conclusion)

## Relevance to platform
This study directly justifies three platform design choices: (1) no badges or points systems (expected tangible rewards), (2) delight moments that are semi-random and unexpected rather than on a predictable schedule, (3) AI encouragement designed as informational feedback rather than reward delivery — the platform's design choices map precisely onto the conditions that avoid the overjustification effect.
