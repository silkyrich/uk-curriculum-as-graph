## Summary
This 2025 paper from MDPI Electronics addresses the problem of learning path recommendation using knowledge graphs, directly relevant to the platform's use of a Neo4j prerequisite graph for sequencing. The paper examines how graph-structured representations of domain knowledge can be used to generate personalised learning sequences that respect prerequisite dependencies. It represents the current applied research frontier at the intersection of knowledge graph technology and adaptive learning path systems.

## Key findings
- Knowledge graphs provide a structured domain representation that can drive principled learning path recommendation
- Prerequisite relationships encoded in the graph can be used to determine which concepts are "ready to learn" (the outer fringe concept)
- Graph-based recommendation is directly applicable to Neo4j-backed curriculum structures
- 2025 publication date indicates this is at or near the current research frontier for this specific application

## Relevance to platform
This paper is directly relevant to implementing learning path recommendation using the Neo4j prerequisite graph; the Cypher query pattern for identifying outer fringe concepts (concepts whose prerequisite nodes all exceed mastery threshold) is the practical implementation of the approach this paper addresses theoretically.
