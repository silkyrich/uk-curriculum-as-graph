## Overview

The Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSS-M) were developed in 2009–2010
by the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) and the National Governors
Association (NGA Center). They define what students should understand and be able to
do in K–12 mathematics.

As of 2024, adopted by 41 states and Washington DC. Non-adopting states include Texas,
Virginia, Indiana (withdrew after initial adoption), and others.

## Structure

### Standards for Mathematical Practice (MPs)

Eight practices applicable across all grade levels:

| MP | Title |
|---|---|
| MP.1 | Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them |
| MP.2 | Reason abstractly and quantitatively |
| MP.3 | Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others |
| MP.4 | Model with mathematics |
| MP.5 | Use appropriate tools strategically |
| MP.6 | Attend to precision |
| MP.7 | Look for and make use of structure |
| MP.8 | Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning |

**UK comparison:** MPs map closely to the UK's Mathematical Reasoning and Problem
Solving epistemic skills. MP.1 (perseverance), MP.3 (mathematical argument), and
MP.6 (precision) have direct equivalents in the UK MathematicalReasoning skill nodes.

### Content Standards

Organised by grade (K–8) then by conceptual category (grades 9–12):

**K–8 domains include:** Counting and Cardinality, Operations and Algebraic Thinking,
Number and Operations in Base Ten, Measurement and Data, Geometry,
Number and Operations — Fractions, Ratios and Proportional Relationships,
The Number System, Expressions and Equations, Functions, Statistics and Probability.

**9–12 conceptual categories:** Number and Quantity, Algebra, Functions,
Modeling, Geometry, Statistics and Probability.

**UK comparison:** The domain structure is broadly similar to UK Key Stage organisation.
Notable differences:
- UK KS2 and KS3 are more tightly structured by year group
- CCSS uses more explicit procedural fluency targets (e.g. "know from memory all
  products of two one-digit numbers" by end of grade 3)
- UK places greater emphasis on mastery and depth; CCSS favours spiral progression

## Political Context

Common Core faced significant political opposition from both left and right in the US:
- Conservative critics saw it as federal overreach (state adoption was technically
  voluntary but tied to federal Race to the Top funding)
- Some progressive critics argued the standards were too abstract for young children

Indiana, Oklahoma, and several other states withdrew from Common Core after initially
adopting it. However, many states that "withdrew" created replacement standards that
were nearly identical.

**UK comparison:** The UK National Curriculum revision process (2014 curriculum)
involved similar debates about the appropriate age for formal algebra, times tables
fluency, and calculator use — but without the federal/state political dimension.
