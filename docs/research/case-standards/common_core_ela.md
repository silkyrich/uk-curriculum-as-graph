## Overview

The Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts and Literacy in
History/Social Studies, Science, and Technical Subjects (CCSS-ELA) define reading,
writing, speaking/listening, and language standards for K–12.

A distinctive feature is the "Literacy in History/Social Studies, Science, and
Technical Subjects" strand (grades 6–12), which embeds reading/writing skills
explicitly in non-English subjects — something with no direct UK equivalent.

## Structure

### Anchor Standards (College and Career Readiness)

Ten anchor standards for Reading, ten for Writing, six for Speaking and Listening,
and six for Language. These describe the capstone expectations and are the same
across all grade bands.

**UK comparison:** The anchor standards concept is similar to the UK's broader
"Reading for Pleasure" and "Writing for Different Purposes" strands, but more
explicitly articulated and cross-subject in scope.

### Reading Standards

Four strands:
- **Key Ideas and Details** (Anchor Standards 1–3)
- **Craft and Structure** (Anchor Standards 4–6)
- **Integration of Knowledge and Ideas** (Anchor Standards 7–9)
- **Range of Reading and Level of Text Complexity** (Anchor Standard 10)

**UK comparison:** Maps to the UK's Reading domain in English programmes.
CCSS is more explicit about text complexity levels (using Lexile measures);
the UK uses broader descriptors.

### Writing Standards

Ten standards covering text types, production/distribution, research, and range.
The tri-text-types model (argument, informative/explanatory, narrative) is
a central organising principle.

**UK comparison:** UK distinguishes between creative writing, non-fiction writing,
and transactional writing but without the explicit "argument" framing.
The CCSS emphasis on evidence-based argument writing at all grade levels
is more explicit than the UK approach.

## Cross-Subject Literacy (Grades 6–12)

CCSS-ELA includes standards for:
- Reading in History/Social Studies
- Reading in Science and Technical Subjects
- Writing in History/Social Studies, Science, and Technical Subjects

These specify that teachers of science, history, and technical subjects share
responsibility for developing literacy.

**UK comparison:** The UK National Curriculum makes similar expectations
(e.g. "reading for information" appears in science programmes of study) but
these are embedded within subject-specific content rather than cross-subject
anchor standards.
