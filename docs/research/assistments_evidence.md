## Summary
The ASSISTments evidence page summarises a body of randomised controlled trial evidence for the ASSISTments platform, a free formative assessment and homework tool used in US middle schools. ASSISTments combines immediate formative feedback with scaffolded hints and teacher-facing reporting. Its evidence base is among the strongest in free-to-use edtech, achieving IES "Positive effects without reservation" and ESSA Tier 1 (Strong) status.

## Key findings
- IES rating: "Positive effects without reservation"; ESSA Tier 1 (Strong evidence standard)
- Maine Study (46 schools, 2,769 7th-grade students): students using ASSISTments learned 60% more mathematics than control group; effect size 0.22; achievement gap between lower- and higher-achieving students narrowed
- North Carolina Study (63 schools, 5,991 7th-grade students): 30% more learning one year after the intervention ended (delayed effect size 0.10); effects were stronger for economically disadvantaged students
- Immediate feedback study: students receiving immediate feedback learned 12% more than those receiving delayed feedback; effect size 0.37
- Cost evidence: ASSISTments is free; schools reportedly save approximately $9,000 annually versus comparable paid platforms
- Learning acceleration: lower-achieving students experienced approximately 2x learning acceleration compared to higher-achieving peers, suggesting a potential equity benefit

## Direct quotes
From the briefing summary based on page access:

"IES rating: 'Positive effects without reservation'; ESSA Tier 1"

"Immediate feedback: 12% more learning vs delayed feedback, effect size 0.37"

"2x learning acceleration for lower-achieving students"

## Relevance to platform
The immediate feedback finding (effect size 0.37) is one of the cleanest single-variable estimates available in edtech; the platform should treat every question attempt as requiring immediate post-attempt feedback — not deferred to session end — and the ASSISTments scaffolded hint model (increasingly specific hints rather than immediate full answers) is a direct design reference for the hint system.
