## 1. Data (Use and Access) Act

**Status:** Became law 19 June 2025
**Impact:** All ICO guidance is under review and may be subject to change. The Act modifies some data protection provisions. Specific changes to children's data protections are being assessed.

**For us:** Monitor ICO guidance updates. Current compliance architecture should remain valid, but specific requirements may shift.

## 2. Online Safety Act 2023 — Protection of Children Codes

**Status:** Complementary statutory safety duties effective from July 2025
**Impact:** Imposes harm risk assessments and age-appropriate features that work alongside the ICO's Children's Code. Ofcom-regulated.

**For us:** May impose additional safety duties beyond data protection (content safety, harm prevention). Relevant if our platform hosts user-generated content or AI-generated content that could be harmful.

## 3. Proposed Education-Specific Code of Practice

**Status:** Proposed legislation (not yet enacted as of Feb 2026)
**Impact:** Would require the ICO Commissioner to prepare guidance specifically covering:
- Impact of profiling and automated decision-making on children's access to education opportunities
- Need for transparency and evidence of efficacy of AI systems in education provision
- Children's data processing by educational technology providers

**For us:** This is the most directly relevant upcoming legislation. If enacted, it would provide specific regulatory clarity on our exact use case (AI-driven adaptive learning with profiling). Current analysis in `ico_profiling_standards.md` relies on the general "compelling reason" framework because education-specific guidance does not yet exist.

**Source:** The Data (Use and Access) Bill included provisions for this code. Defend Digital Me's analysis (March 2025) discusses the scope and implications.

## 4. ICO Children's Code Strategy Progress

### March 2025 update
- ICO reviewed recommender systems and their use of children's personal information
- Found: platforms provide limited details about how they use information to make recommendations or protect children's privacy
- Signals increased regulatory scrutiny of algorithmic personalisation for children

### December 2025 update
- Latest enforcement activity and guidance updates
- Continued focus on age assurance and profiling

**For us:** The regulatory direction is toward MORE scrutiny of automated systems serving children, not less. Our transparency-first architecture (explainable decisions, parent dashboard, curriculum grounding) positions us well, but we should not assume the current framework is the final word.

## Monitoring plan

| Legislation | Next milestone | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Data (Use and Access) Act | ICO revised guidance publication | Review and update compliance architecture |
| Online Safety Act | Ofcom codes effective July 2025 | Assess whether safety duties apply to us |
| Education code of practice | Parliamentary progress / ICO consultation | Engage with consultation if possible |
| ICO Children's Code Strategy | Next progress update (likely mid-2026) | Monitor for enforcement precedents relevant to edtech |

## Caveats

Legislative tracking is inherently time-sensitive. This document reflects the state as of February 2026. All upcoming legislation items should be re-checked before any launch decision.
