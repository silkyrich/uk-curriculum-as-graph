## What it is

ICO guidance specifically addressing how the Children's Code applies to education technology providers. Clarifies the critical distinction between when edtech is in scope of the Code and when it is not.

## Key rules

### Schools are exempt; edtech providers may not be

The Children's Code does NOT apply to:
- Schools and educational/training institutions processing student data for educational purposes
- Government and local authorities in the context of educational service provision

Schools do not meet the definition of an Information Society Service (ISS) and are not in scope.

### When edtech IS in scope (Code applies)

Two scenarios:

1. **Direct-to-consumer**: The edtech service is likely to be accessed by children on a direct-to-consumer basis (including via parents). This is our model.

2. **School-mediated but self-directing**: The service is provided through a school but the edtech provider determines the purpose of the processing of children's personal information (i.e., acts as a controller, not merely a processor).

The Code applies even if the service is provided on a non-profit basis, because most similar services are provided for remuneration, and the ICO considers that non-profit edtech services constitute "normally provided for remuneration" under the ISS definition.

### When edtech is NOT in scope (Code does not apply)

ALL three conditions must be met:
1. The service is NOT accessed on a direct-to-consumer basis
2. The provider ONLY processes information to fulfil the school's public tasks and educational functions as determined by the school
3. The provider acts SOLELY on the instructions of the school and does not process the information in any other form beyond these instructions

In this case, the provider is a "digital extension of the school's offline activities" and is likely acting as a processor.

**Critical**: The processing role is NOT determined by what the contract says. It is determined by whether the provider in fact exercises control over the means and purposes of processing. Calling yourself a "processor" in a contract does not make you one if you actually determine why and how data is processed.

## Application to our platform

We are clearly in scope because:
- We offer a direct-to-parent/child service
- We determine the purposes of processing (adaptive learning, knowledge tracing)
- We determine the means of processing (our algorithms, our pedagogical decisions)
- Parents/children access us directly, not through a school intermediary

If we later add a B2B school channel, the analysis would change for that channel only — but our direct-to-consumer service remains in scope regardless.

## Relevance to platform

This guidance confirms that we cannot rely on the education exemption. Full compliance with all 15 standards of the Children's Code is required.

## Caveats

The ICO edtech guidance page could not be directly fetched (403). Analysis based on web search summaries from the ICO page plus secondary legal analysis from Bates Wells and Stevens & Bolton. Manual review of the full ICO page is recommended.
