## Summary
This systematic review examined 28 studies involving 4,597 K-12 students to assess the effectiveness of AI-driven ITS systems compared with both conventional instruction and non-intelligent digital systems. The review identifies core features associated with effective ITS, compares commercially deployed systems (Cognitive Tutor, Yixue Squirrel AI, Writing Pal, ALEKS, Duolingo), and — critically — notes that no reviewed study addressed ethical implications of the systems evaluated.

## Key findings
- 28 studies, 4,597 K-12 students analysed across the review
- 7 of 8 comparisons between ITS and conventional instruction showed medium-to-large positive effects
- ITS vs. non-intelligent digital systems: mixed results; only 1 of 4 comparisons showed a clear AI advantage — suggesting that the pedagogical design matters more than AI sophistication per se
- Effect sizes ranged from d = 0.31 to d = 1.30 across studies; one study (Yixue Squirrel AI, China) found 4.19x greater learning gains versus conventional instruction
- Core features associated with effectiveness: personalisation, immediate feedback, adaptivity, self-regulation support
- ITS most effective as a complementary tool alongside teacher instruction, not as a replacement
- Systems reviewed: Cognitive Tutor (Carnegie Learning), Yixue Squirrel AI, Writing Pal, ALEKS, Duolingo
- Major oversight identified by authors: none of the reviewed studies addressed ethical implications of the AI systems, including data privacy, algorithmic bias, or equity

## Direct quotes
From the briefing summary based on full text access:

"7 of 8 comparisons showed medium-to-large positive effects vs conventional instruction"

"ITS most effective as complementary tool, not replacement"

"MAJOR OVERSIGHT: none of reviewed studies addressed ethical implications"

## Relevance to platform
The finding that ITS advantage over non-intelligent digital systems is weak (only 1 of 4 comparisons) confirms that getting the pedagogy right matters more than the AI layer itself; the platform should prioritise sound pedagogical sequencing (productive failure, spaced retrieval, prerequisite gating) over the sophistication of the AI model. The ethical gap identified in the literature is a direct prompt to address privacy, data minimisation, and the ICO Children's Code from the outset.
